NARRATOR:
Kids, it's not always rational,
but people on their wedding day

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:06,412
sometimes find themselves
panicking

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,640
about whether
they've made the best choice.

4
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,006
I have a better
tie at home!

5
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,184
It's cornflower blue.
It's cornflower blue!

6
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:15,523
NARRATOR:
But lucky for Barney,
he was marrying a rock.

7
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,119
I can't go through
with this wedding.

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,889
Last year, when you helped
Victoria escape this church,

9
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,894
how hard was it
to climb down that drainpipe?

10
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,056
Extremely hard.

11
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:28,495
Okay, so that means
super easy. Thanks.

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,699
Wait, wait.
Stop, stop.

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,100
What the hell
are you doing?

14
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,702
I just... I can't
go through with this!

15
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,603
No, no. Sorry. I
refuse to be a part

16
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,935
of a third runaway
bride situation.

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,739
It's like the dude

18
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,671
in that documentary who kept
having women show up dead

19
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,037
at the bottom of his staircase.

20
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,235
Sure, maybe they all tripped,
but it's like,

21
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:43,936
do you want
to hang out with that guy?

22
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,177
Gonna think I'm insane, but...

23
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,924
I still think that it's a bad
sign I never found that locket.

24
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:01,058
Some part of me thought that
Barney would magically find it.

25
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,225
I know.

26
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,603
I know that's unfair of me

27
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,901
to expect that, but... you know,
I want to be with a guy

28
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,274
who comes through for me,
you know?

29
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,873
The guy who,

30
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,644
somehow, against all odds,

31
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,214
finds my locket.

32
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,254
Okay, just, um...
just calm down, stay put.

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,120
Uh, I'm-I'm gonna go
get you some water, okay?

Media Access Group at WGBH

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,350
Uh, listen,
I have something for you,

36
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:56,152
but before I give it to you,

37
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:58,354
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

38
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,086
I was freaking out
a little earlier,

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,690
but Lily and Marshall
calmed me down. I'm okay.

40
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,963
Good, good.
So, Robin's a little nervous.

41
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,492
Nervous? Why is she nervous?

42
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:07,927
I'm not nervous! Who's nervous?!

43
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,361
No one needs to be nervous!

44
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:12,167
Cornflower blue, Ted.
Cornflower blue!

45
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,200
First off, kudos to Marshall
and Lily for calming you down.

46
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,768
Second, do you...
you remember Robin's locket?

47
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,378
Yeah, of course.

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,080
She never found it.

49
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,017
Whoa. How did you...?

50
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,719
I never told you about it
because I was afraid

51
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:31,991
you'd take it the wrong way,

52
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,289
but I actually wound up
tracking it down.

53
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:35,861
It's a long story.

54
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,359
I was gonna give it to Robin
as a surprise,

55
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,502
but... she needs it
to come from you.

56
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,659
Ted, I don't know.

57
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,567
Take it. Please.

58
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,569
How'd you find it?

59
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,571
I didn't find it.

60
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,543
You found it.

61
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,737
*

62
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,051
Hey.
Hey.

63
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,393
What you writing?

64
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,148
Um, it's my wedding day.

65
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,486
What do you think I'm writing?

66
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,491
Suicide note?

67
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,662
Hey-yo! (laughs)

68
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,231
Oh, God, is it
a suicide note?

69
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,400
Oh, my God,
how many pills did you take?

70
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,028
Quick. How do we
make him vomit?

71
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,203
Uh, remind him
he's getting married.
Hey-yo!

72
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,002
(laughs)
Wait. Now I'm confused.

73
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,573
Are you dying?

74
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,172
I'm writing my vows to Robin,

75
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,773
but I want them to be profound
and inspiring,

76
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,936
as if they were written
by the bard himself,

77
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,035
Lionel Richie.

78
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,007
Then why did you wait

79
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,684
until right before the wedding
to compose them?

80
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,883
I didn't.
I've been trying

81
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,524
to get these
right for weeks.
Oh.

82
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,119
This is a lot of vows.

83
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,450
Vow-za.

84
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:41,187
I'll say it again. Vow-za.

85
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,891
Are you really gonna
read all of these?

86
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,963
Yeah, uh, wouldn't it be better
to project them

87
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,192
as a VowerPoint presentation?

88
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,126
(clicks tongue)
Say it again. VowerPoint...

89
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,261
I know it's a lot,
but I-I don't

90
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:52,628
want to screw up
this wedding thing.

91
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,196
"I vow to love you
forever unconditionally,

92
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,035
"unless you pudge out,
in which case

93
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,071
I'm a Barney-shaped
hole in the wall."

94
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,078
"I vow to start watching
hockey with you..."

95
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,040
Oh, that one's sweet.

96
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,807
I know how much
you hate hockey.

97
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,046
"...once a month."

98
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,550
But it's still
a nice gesture.

99
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,122
"No. Once a year.
No. Hockey's dumb.

100
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,050
"Not watching it, and
neither are you, woman.

101
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,945
Now make me
French toast."

102
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,656
I'll put this in
the maybe pile.

103
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,929
Look, if you're
having trouble,

104
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,728
you've got two expert
vow consultants

105
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,460
standing right
in front of you.

106
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,455
Yeah. We can show
you vow it's done.

107
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,572
Say it again.
Vow it's done...

108
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,100
We're just not
enjoying them, honey.

109
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,406
I am not gonna take
marriage advice from a couple

110
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,139
who just got
in a gigantic fight.

111
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,843
I'm doing fine on my own.

112
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,405
No, you're not.

113
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:40,114
All of these vows are selfish
and way too easy to keep.

114
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,677
Wedding vows need
to be real commitments,

115
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,976
like our vows.

116
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,187
Poppycock!

117
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,488
What are you
talking about?

118
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,690
I remember
your precious wedding vows,

119
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,992
and I guarantee you've broken
every single one of them.

120
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,455
Vow dare you!

121
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,534
Just stop.

122
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:57,632
I can't.
It's invowluntary.

123
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,495
(knocking)
Yeah.

124
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,303
Hey. You asked for me?

125
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,195
Look what Barney
just gave me.

126
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,165
No way!

127
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,476
See? Barney came through.

128
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,939
There's your sign.

129
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,347
You're good to go.

130
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,149
Where'd you find
the locket, Ted?

131
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,524
Where did you find the locket?

132
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,356
Me? Why-why are you asking me?

133
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,132
Barney found it. Ask him.

134
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,729
What, you lost a locket?

135
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,031
Barney wouldn't tell me
how he found it,

136
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,803
which made me realize
it had to be you.

137
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,803
(laughs):
Okay.

138
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,835
I'll embarrass him.

139
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,010
Your fiancÃ© got a metal detector

140
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,039
and scoured a 10,000-square-foot
grid around that carousel.

141
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,005
Guess where he found it.

142
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,484
The nest of a mama pigeon.

143
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,324
(laughs): Barney had to wrestle
it away from four baby pigeons.

144
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,079
But here's where the story
gets bittersweet.

145
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:54,148
I lied. Barney said it was
in Marshall and Lily's basement.

146
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,827
But do you still want to finish
your little pigeon story?

147
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,758
The mama pigeon gets killed
by a cab.

148
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,103
Barney still goes back
to the park every day

149
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,799
to feed the babies. The end.

150
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,795
Tell me the truth.

151
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,868
Okay, I-I tracked it down,

152
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,073
and I gave it to Barney
to give to you.

153
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,565
Honestly, it was no big deal.

154
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:14,677
How did you find it?

155
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,038
Psh. How does anybody
find anything?

156
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,277
You hear it might be in your

157
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,581
race car pencil box.
It's not there.

158
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,853
So you swing by
your ex-fiancÃ©e's

159
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:21,921
storage locker
on the opposite coast.

160
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:22,949
It's not there.

161
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,623
You learn Victoria has it
in Germany,

162
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,292
but Jeanette intercepts it,
throws it in Central Park Lake.

163
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,059
It's a nice day for a swim,
so what the heck?

164
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,888
You dive in, scoop it up, make
it home in time for Jeopardy!

165
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:30,993
Ease to the pease.
Happy wedding.

166
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,972
You're seriously questioning
our wedding vows?

167
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,298
Us? Uh, we're adorable.

168
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,243
We're Marshmallow
and Lilypad, bitch.

169
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,110
Okay, I'll give you this.

170
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,938
Your little pre-wedding
wedding out by the tree--

171
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,235
you said some very sweet stuff.

172
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,277
Hell, Ted even cried.

173
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,082
(scoffs)

174
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,153
Ted.

175
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,492
But later,
at the actual wedding...

176
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,048
Lily Aldrin,

177
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,756
I vow to be there for you
in sickness and in health.

178
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,120
Hate to tell you, Lilypad,

179
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,987
but Marshall has since
confessed to me

180
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,056
that en route
to your honeymoon...

181
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,425
(retching):
Oh. Oh, God.

182
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,126
(snoring)

183
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,997
You son of a beech.
You son of a beech.

184
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,336
Do you deny it?

185
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,766
Lily, you know
I'm not a vomit guy,

186
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,438
and I just thought
I should give you your space.

187
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,776
Like a dying cat.

188
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,081
Oh, yeah, that saves it.

189
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,282
I'm so sorry I let you down.

190
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,353
Hang on there,
Marshmallow.

191
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,921
Remember when
the blushing bride said...

192
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,121
I vow to honor and respect you.

193
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,594
Maybe she was blushing because
she was lying her ass off.

194
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,094
Not two months later...

195
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,825
Shh.
Okay. Okay.

196
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,130
Hey, not cool!

197
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,674
You will not take a picture
of my husband like that!

198
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,700
(laughter)

199
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:51,968
(camera clicks)

200
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,265
MARSHALL:
You took part

201
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,776
in the bearded Wonder Woman
incident of 2007?

202
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,179
Lily, that photo got
all over Friendster

203
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:02,051
and Myspace and... man,
2007 was a long time ago.

204
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,153
Ted, I can't believe

205
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,294
how much trouble you went
through to get this for me.

206
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,989
It really wasn't
that much trouble.

207
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,091
Yes, it was.

208
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,963
You always go big for me.

209
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,892
Not as big as Barney.

210
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,027
Canadian rehearsal dinner
on ice-- big.

211
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,073
The way he proposed-- huge.

212
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,028
Yeah, but think about it.

213
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,496
Those are the most loving things

214
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,174
that Barney has ever done
for me,

215
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,342
and they're all based on lies.

216
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,640
Right down to taking
credit for this locket.

217
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,013
That's not fair.

218
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,140
I told Barney
to take credit for it.

219
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,035
Which he did
without blinking an eye.

220
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:30,977
Because lying

221
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,581
is second nature to Barney.

222
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:33,883
Everything's legendary.

223
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,324
You know what "legendary" means?

224
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,718
Not real.

225
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,850
I mean,
the man's initials are "B.S."

226
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:42,216
If it helps, I'm pretty sure
Barney Stinson's a fake name.

227
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm kidding.

228
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:48,002
You're the one who always
comes through for me, Ted.

229
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,558
The one who's there for me.

230
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,025
Maybe I'm making a mistake.

231
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,737
Wait. What-what are you saying?

232
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,638
Maybe I should be marrying you.

233
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,745
Wait. I know one vow we kept.

234
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,948
I vow to make you breakfast
in bed every Sunday morning.

235
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:09,952
Really? You still do that?

236
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,423
Absolutely.

237
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:15,062
(baby crying)

238
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,088
MARSHALL:
Heads up!

239
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,055
Oh! No cream cheese?

240
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,195
Oh.

241
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,531
BARNEY:
Oh!

242
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,396
You feed her like Sloth
from Goonies.

243
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,095
So the magic's still there.

244
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,267
Well, here's one

245
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,274
you definitely didn't keep.

246
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:37,136
I vow to keep
the romantic spark alive.

247
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,477
And how is that going
for you these days?

248
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,982
MARSHALL:
Are you watching Marvin?

249
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,384
I'm trimming my nose hair.

250
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,815
LILY:
I'm dumping out.

251
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,551
I watched him
all morning, Lily.

252
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,885
I need a break.

253
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,960
I don't control when my
deuces happen, Marshall.

254
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,989
Deuces are wild!

255
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,094
(laughing)

256
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,256
Ted,

257
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,434
I should be with you.

258
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,303
NARRATOR:
There it was-- the words

259
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,071
that some deep, dark part of me
always wanted to hear.

260
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,271
But it's funny.

261
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,402
Once you actually
hear those words out loud...

262
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,137
I don't want to hear that.

263
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,273
We should get out of here.

264
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,107
You and me right now.
We'll...

265
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,913
We'll move to Chicago.
W-We'll start a new life.

266
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,075
It'll-it'll be painful
at first,

267
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,453
but, hell, I can root
for the Blackhawks.

268
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,821
Stop! Stop!

269
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,919
You're just saying this
because you're scared.

270
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,451
I am not your
future. Barney is.

271
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:24,017
Shouldn't I be with the guy
who finds me my locket?

272
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,127
The guy who steals me
the blue French horn.

273
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,100
I mean, look me in the eye
and tell me,

274
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,759
why shouldn't I be
with that guy?

275
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,868
Because I'm not that guy
anymore.

276
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:37,341
Then why did you work so hard
to find me my locket?

277
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,170
It... it was a wedding gift.

278
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,106
Ted, stop it, okay?
I know you better than that.

279
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,041
This is more
than a wedding gift.

280
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,346
Maybe it started out that way.
Maybe some part of me thought...

281
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,979
That you still loved me.

282
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,216
Maybe.

283
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,050
But the truth is...

284
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,915
I don't love you
like that anymore.

285
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,188
And you don't love me.

286
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,393
You love Barney.

287
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,864
And if you think

288
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,962
I would ever be part
of screwing that up,

289
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,965
then maybe you don't know me
at all, Robin.

290
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,528
(groans)

291
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,166
I... I can't shake it.

292
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,041
I-I can't shake this feeling

293
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,340
that nothing about me and Barney
makes any sense.

294
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,583
But love doesn't make sense.

295
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,708
I mean, you can't

296
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,714
logic your way into
or out of it.

297
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:22,546
Love is totally nonsensical,
but we have to keep doing it

298
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,552
or else we're lost
and-and love is dead

299
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,815
and humanity
should just pack it in.

300
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,615
Because love is
the best thing we do.

301
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,099
Look, I know that sounds cheesy,
but it's-it's just true.

302
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:39,028
You love Barney,
and-and he loves you.

303
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,766
And that doesn't
have to make sense

304
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,572
to make sense.

305
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:50,106
Remember back when you had
never even seen me pee?

306
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,113
Yeah.
Yeah.

307
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,845
Oh, sorry.

308
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,121
We were so innocent then.

309
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,748
So many dreams.

310
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,524
Trying to work over here.

311
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,091
Bright, shimmering future ahead.

312
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,090
Now we're basically
a couple of wild animals

313
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,593
grunting at each other
to throw some toilet paper

314
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,025
through the crack
in the bathroom door.

315
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,601
Baby, let's be honest.

316
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,129
At this point,
that door is wide open.

317
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,097
You know what you should use
the next time you run out

318
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,936
of toilet paper?
Your wedding vows.

319
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,271
'Cause that's all
your marriage has been,

320
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,706
one long six-year wipe

321
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,041
after that double-flusher
of a wedding.

322
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,607
Stinson out!

323
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,051
You okay?

324
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,152
Yeah.

325
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,993
You're right.
I'm-I'm being insane.

326
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,149
Oh, come on, Robin.

327
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,056
That's... accurate.

328
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,119
(chuckles)

329
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,787
We can't run away together.

330
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,786
(chuckles)
Of course not.

331
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,998
So I'm just gonna run away
alone!

332
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,967
(panting)

333
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,010
Damn it.

334
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,109
(panting)

335
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,441
(yelps) Whoa!

336
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,175
NARRATOR: And that's how Robin
met your mother.

337
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,321
Wait, what are
we doing here?

338
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:08,763
Lily, our-our
wedding vows,

339
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,258
maybe they were just too
perfect for real life.

340
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,031
Real life is messier
than that, and...

341
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,961
we're different people
than we were in 2007.

342
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,127
But that's okay.

343
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,965
Maybe we just need
some updated vows.

344
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,641
So I thought maybe
before this place

345
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,739
gets too busy, we could...
borrow this altar for a minute.

346
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,280
Lily Aldrin,

347
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:36,152
I vow to stop shouting stuff
at you when you're dumping out.

348
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,453
You're the love
of my life,

349
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,194
and you deserve
to make a deuce in peace.

350
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,124
I vow to stop pointing out
every dog erection we see

351
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,727
when we walk through the park,

352
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,128
even though they are
incredibly weird looking.

353
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,601
Oh, just don't point and scream
"Maybe it's Maybelline."

354
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,525
Marshall Eriksen,
I vow to always tell you

355
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,037
when you have green stuff
in your teeth.

356
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,040
You have green stuff
in your teeth.

357
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,312
Oh.
(chuckles)

358
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,980
I vow to always sit next to you
and hug you,

359
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,151
even if you're covered in vomit,

360
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:06,979
whether it's yours

361
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,984
or Marvin's or--

362
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:12,046
in the case of what came to be
known as Spew Year's Eve 1998--

363
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,645
my own. Sorry.

364
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,357
I vow to stop getting
so angry...

365
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,389
Ooh, I just thought of
another one.

366
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,434
...when you interrupt me.

367
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,088
Mine was to interrupt you less,

368
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,427
so that's good.

369
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,556
I vow...

370
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,867
to finally stop petitioning
Paul McCartney

371
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,871
to let Weird Al record
"Chicken Pot Pie"

372
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:34,114
to the tune of
"Live and Let Die."

373
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,941
It's over.

374
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,376
I'll let it go.

375
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,580
I vow...

376
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,752
to cry less
during this pregnancy.

377
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,222
I vow to cry less
during this Vikings season.

378
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:48,062
Mm, with that secondary,
I wouldn't make that promise.

379
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:51,418
I vow to keep at least 80%
of these vows.

380
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,188
That seems high.

381
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,396
And I vow to keep updating them
as we go.

382
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,127
Because one set of vows,

383
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,066
it can't cover a lifetime
of growing

384
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,272
and changing with you,

385
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,014
of raising children with you...

386
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,948
...falling more and more in love
with you every day,

387
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,979
Lily Aldrin,
which is what I vow to do

388
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,945
for the rest of my life.

389
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:21,094
Crap. I already broke
my crying vow.

390
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,861
I'll forgive you.

391
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,802
I am so sorry.
Are you okay?
Oh...

392
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,604
That was
totally my fault.

393
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,306
No. The bride is always right.
It was my fault.

394
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,438
Are you okay?

395
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,442
I'm fine.

396
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,914
Are you sure?

397
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,483
Because you
were sprinting

398
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,752
from a church
in a wedding dress.

399
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,020
And as a kid,

400
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,979
I was a bit of a detective...

401
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,018
(chuckles):
so...

402
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,352
Um...

403
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,017
to be honest,
I'm-I'm wondering if this...

404
00:15:57,057 --> 00:16:00,827
whole getting married thing is
something I can go through with.

405
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,300
Oh.

406
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,970
Wow.

407
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,199
That's it?

408
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,365
Aren't you supposed
to talk me out of it?

409
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,313
Tell me it's just cold feet?
I'm-I'm being crazy?

410
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,040
Okay, during that fall, we did
kind of get to second base

411
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,706
with each other--
and we'll always share that--

412
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,214
but I don't really know you.

413
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,507
So...

414
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,848
here's all I'll say:

415
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,122
when I'm overwhelmed,

416
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,021
I force myself
to do one simple thing

417
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,523
before I have to make
a decision:

418
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:32,885
close my eyes
and take three deep breaths.

419
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,225
Three deep breaths.
Mm-hmm.

420
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:38,902
Sometimes even three deep
breaths can change everything.

421
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,941
(breathing deeply)

422
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,188
Barney?

423
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,993
Hey, I've been looking
for you. You okay?

424
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,994
Uh... yeah.
I-I was just talking to the...

425
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,557
the band about the...
thing with the stuff.

426
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,268
What are those?

427
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,400
My vows.

428
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,498
I-I know it's bad luck
to see the bride

429
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,507
right before the ceremony,
but I realized something.

430
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,380
Marshall and Lily have broken
most of their wedding vows,

431
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,110
but they're still
the best couple I know.

432
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,105
I think their biggest problem

433
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,717
was that Marshall
didn't tell Lily the truth.

434
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,119
So...

435
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,016
I've decided to make
only one vow to you,

436
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,056
because it's the only one
that really counts.

437
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,004
Robin Scherbatsky...

438
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,527
...from this day forward,

439
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,136
I am always gonna be honest
with you.

440
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,937
'Cause I love you.

441
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,743
I'll see you up there.

442
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,308
Oh.

443
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,145
Ted got that locket for you.

444
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,250
He's the one you should thank.

445
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,118
Barney, wait.

446
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,628
(Pachelbel's Canon in D playing)

447
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,006
(quietly):
What is it?

448
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,939
The cornflower blue tie.

449
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,535
That's the one
I should be wearing.

450
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,981
It's right by my bed.
Back in Manhattan.

451
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,123
Stall for me. I'll be back
in six hours, tops.

452
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,086
That's all of 'em!

453
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,290
Wow.

454
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,192
Wait.

455
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,993
I'm free.

456
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,834
It's over.

457
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,999
The slap bet is finally... over?

458
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,129
Yeah, it is, buddy.

459
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,325
(exhales)
Thank you.

460
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,467
You know, this
may sound crazy,

461
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,136
but I'm gonna miss
that slap bet.

462
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:02,814
No, you won't.
No, you're
right. I won't.

463

(Handel's "Hornpipe"

464
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:26,872
Hi.

465
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:27,999
Hi.

466
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,895
You've never looked
more beautiful, Robin.

467
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:33,067
Nobody asked you, Patrice.

468
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,665
By the way,

469
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,547
in the interest of honesty,
we really do have a ring bear.

470
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:39,778
What?

471
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,350
Oh. I love
the ring bear.

472
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,756
Then you are gonna love
the flower gorilla.

473
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,219
What?
Kidding. I'm kidding.

474
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,088
(chuckles)

475
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,125
(clears throat)

476
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,499
* If I ever
were to lose you... *

NARRATOR:
Kids, I won't lie,

478
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,413
that was a long weekend.

479
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,936
More ups and downs
than I can count.

480
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:14,946
* I've not found by myself...

481
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,951
It was a twisting,

482
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,553
turning road that led
to the end of the aisle,

483
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:23,186
and not everything
along the way was perfect.

484
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,762
To be honest,

485
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,031
not everything to follow
would be perfect either.

486
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,059
But what is?

487
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,055
Here's the secret, kids:

488
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,597
none of us can vow
to be perfect.

489
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,544
In the end, all we can do
is promise to love each other

490
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,040
with everything we've got.

491
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,041
* 'Cause I can see

492
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,135
* Our future days...

493
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,607
Because love's
the best thing we do.

494
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:51,417
* Days of you and me...

495
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,317
And on that lovely
spring evening,

496
00:20:56,356 --> 00:21:00,126
that's exactly what Barney
and Robin vowed to each other.

497
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,159
And it was legendary.
