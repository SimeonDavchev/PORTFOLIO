1
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:16,154
LILY:
Marshall's almost here.

2
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,994
Yes! Look at us,

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,918
hanging out again.
This is amazing.

4
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,524
This is awesome!

5
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:26,486
This is...
(roaring)
(laughing): Okay.

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,657
Just settle
down, buddy.
No!

7
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:32,266
Settling down is for losers with
kids who never go out anymore.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,330
I am in
charge tonight,

9
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,897
and the earliest
I am allowing anyone

10
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,566
to go home is... 2:00 a.m.

11
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,236
10:00 p.m.
9:45.

12
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,444
3:00 a.m.

13
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:44,445
Guys, tonight
is gonna be legen--

14
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,178
wait for it...

15
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,575
If I leave now,

16
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:49,616
I could put
the kids to bed.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,620
I'll get the check.

18
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,921
..dary!

19
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,522
Legendary!

20
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,594
Guys, the gang is back!

21
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:59,093
We're back!
(sputtering, shouting)

22
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,827
All of us except for Robin.

23
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,296
We never see her anymore.

24
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:05,972
Okay, in addition
to you guys not going home

25
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,639
before 4:00 a.m.--
yes, it's up to 4:00 now--

26
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,809
new rule: anytime anyone talks
about something sad,

27
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,069
we stay out an extra hour.

28
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,478
We said we'd always be there
for the big moments.

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,250
5:00 a.m.
To be fair,

30
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,609
tonight's just
us hanging out

31
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,047
until 10:00 p.m., tops.

32
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,151
It's not a big moment.

33
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:23,083
BARNEY:
Um,

34
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,647
yes, it is.
Um, no, it's not.

35
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,885
Um, yes, it is.
Um... no, it's not.

36
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,321
Um, yes, it is.

37
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,758
I got a phone call today.

38
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,433
A judge in Queens is retiring,
so...

39
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:38,274
I'm gonna be a judge.

40
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,129
(gasps)

41
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,297
(shouting)
Yes! Yes!

42
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,835
(laughing)
Judge Eriksen!

43
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,411
Yeah!
(chuckling)
One more.

44
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,610
I told you the phone would
ring. You deserve this.

45
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,283
Thanks, Lily.

46
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:54,082
I love you, Marshmallow.
TED: Oh.

47
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,654
1:45 a.m.

48
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,153
Well, you were right, Barney,
this night was, in fact,

49
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:01,456
legendary, but...
I know what you're gonna say
and I agree.

50
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:02,959
We're going to Vegas!

51
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,430
TED:
I will be awakened

52
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,528
by screaming children
in less than...

53
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,132
(crying):
four-and-a-half hours.

54
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,195
BARNEY:
You're staying.

55
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,203
I'm going.

56
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,604
Judge Fudge,
your very first ruling?

57
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,965
(deep voice):
He stays.

58
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,313
Hey! See?

59
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,938
Tonight is about

60
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,142
celebrating our enduring bond
as friends.

61
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:25,176
Nay, family. Because
that's what we are, Ted.

62
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,483
We are fa...

63
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:27,854
Okay, fun night,
guys. Keep in touch.

64
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,481
Damn it, Barney.
(choking)

65
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,147
(strained):
Crushing... windpipe.

66
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,516
You're lucky that's
the only pipe I'm crushing.

67
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,855
Aah!
That woman
is half your age.

68
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,990
Haven't you changed,
even a little?

69
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,026
No. I haven't.

70
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,799
Look, I know
there was a time

71
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,871
when it seemed like I was
capable of going the distance,

72
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,969
but... if it wasn't gonna
happen with Robin,

73
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,473
then it's just not gonna
happen with anyone.

74
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,706
I am never

75
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,581
gonna be a guy
who meets a girl

76
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,879
and, from the first time
I see her, I'm just like,

77
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,651
"You are the
love of my life.

78
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,151
"Everything I have

79
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,992
and everything I am
is yours forever."

80
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,019
Really?
No, I'm just making a point.
Move it along.

81
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,357
That's not me.

82
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,433
I'm the guy
who straightens his tie,

83
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,162
says something dirty,
high-fives himself

84
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,366
and then goes and talks
to that girl over there.

85
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,173
That's me.

86
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,911
Can I please... just be me?

87
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,740
Judge Fudge?

88
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,054
I'll allow it.

89
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,680
Then I'll a-plow it. Self-five.

90
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,517
Stinson out.

91
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,023
(rock music playing)

92
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,885
(cheering)
Oh!

93
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,625
(whoops)
MARSHALL:
Hey, so are you guys

94
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,300
ever gonna tie the knot
or are you...

95
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,399
are you just comfortable
living in sin?

96
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,731
Someone's gotten a bit...

97
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,395
judge-y.
Oh!

98
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,404
Sustained.
THE MOTHER:
Yeah.

99
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,406
We'll get around to it.
It's just, you know,

100
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,608
with life and
jobs and kids.

101
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,540
Plus, this one's still
insisting on getting married

102
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,635
in a French castle.

103
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,776
I'd get married tomorrow
in a White Castle,

104
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,623
but this guy needs
more "wow factor."

105
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,049
You're all the wow factor
I need.

106
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,394
BARNEY:
Aw!

107
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,890
(mimics retching)

108
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,792
Glad someone can be happy
on the day of a tragedy.
LILY: Aw, Barney,

109
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,725
you know this is
all fake, right?

110
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,600
That robot's
not really dead.

111
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,959
(laughter)
I'm not

112
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,896
talking about the robot, Lily.
Everyone,

113
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,673
stop having fun! I'm about
to tell a sad story!

114
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:33,913
Guys, remember back in 2010
when I achieved a perfect week?

115
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,911
Seven girls in
seven nights, sure.

116
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,283
BARNEY:
Well, recently,

117
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,081
I decided to attempt...

118
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,252
a perfect month.

119
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,121
I put together
a brand-new playbook.

120
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,951
No, I can't hear this.
This is just too sad.

121
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,957
But I haven't gotten
to the sad part yet.

122
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,259
You're in your 40s and
you have a playbook.

123
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,291
That's

124
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,356
the sad part.

125
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,604
Lily... just...

126
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,299
Okay?

127
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:00,031
So I put together
a brand-new playbook,

128
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,037
filled with plays
I'd never tried before, like...

129
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,708
...where,
as in the '80s classic,

130
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,810
I magically come to life,
if you know what I mean.

131
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,023
...where I wait till a girl
mentions something she likes.

132
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,778
God, I love nachos.

133
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,817
Thank you.

134
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,352
Allow me to introduce myself.

135
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:21,658
My name is Jim,

136
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,459
Jim Nacho.

137
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:27,501
Inventor of the nacho.

138
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,198
So... did you get
a perfect month?

139
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,629
Yes.

140
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,395
Then why are
you so upset?

141
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,804
That last girl, number 31...

142
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,806
Oh, that's a pretty name.
What is that, French?

143
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,169
...she's pregnant.

144
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,317
Wait, you're messing with
us, right? Y-You didn't
really get a girl pregnant.

145
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,850
It's real.

146
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,515
She's pregnant.

147
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:58,688
Kind of puts an asterisk on the
whole perfect month thing, huh?

148
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,860
Barney, are you okay?

149
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,203
Ah, Jim Nantz.

150
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,072
Thank goodness. You're always
here for me in times of trouble.

151
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,571
What should I do?

152
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,273
You're on your own
this time, bro.

153
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,906
Congratulations, Papa.

154
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,612
Stop it. This is a disaster.

155
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,575
Why?

156
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,912
Why? Because I'm too old.

157
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,248
I was about

158
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:26,222
to enter my golden years,
my Clooney years,

159
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,763
my daddy issues years,

160
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,429
where I don't just remind
messed-up girls of their dads

161
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,959
because I'm emotionally distant.

162
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,363
I freaking look like
their dads. That's the dream.

163
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,396
My life

164
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,701
is over.

165
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,673
So where are you guys
registered?

166
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,705
TED:
Another fun fact about the
Goliath National Bank building,

167
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,241
the sleek but historical facade
has been described

168
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,807
by Architecture Vision Monthly
as "modern classicism."

169
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,577
I can see that.

170
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,746
Mm-hmm. Any questions
from the group?

171
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,045
I have a
question.

172
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,046
What happened to the building
that used to be here?

173
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,388
It was way nicer.

174
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,622
Robin!

175
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,387
Oh, my God!

176
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,085
What are you doing here?

177
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,127
I thought you were in...

178
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,761
Greece, uh, Morocco, Moscow.

179
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,898
Yeah, World Wide News
keeps me pretty busy.

180
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,133
And pretty famous.

181
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,467
I mean, you're everywhere.

182
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:18,013
I am not everywhere. The...

183
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,806
Okay, I'm some places.

184
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,981
(laughs):
Hi, Penny.

185
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,310
Oh, my gosh, I haven't
seen you in forever.

186
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,816
I like you, bus lady.
Oh,

187
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:29,849
I like you, too.

188
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,323
Never call me that again.

189
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,091
(giggles)

190
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,649
And that was it.

191
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,417
Wow.
Hm.

192
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,855
A genuine Scherbatsky sighting
out in nature.

193
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:42,262
At this point, that's
like seeing Sasquatch.

194
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,795
No, Sasquatch is a warm
and affectionate creature.

195
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,032
At this point, Robin's
more like the yeti--

196
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,467
cold and aloof.

197
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,936
Hey, Ted.

198
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,311
Ask me if the Abominable
Snowman called.

199
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,040
Has the Abominable Snowman
called?

200
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,335
Not yeti.

201
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,647
Here we are again.

202
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:02,349
Another big moment for us,
and Robin's missing it.

203
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,822
MARSHALL:
I know, baby.

204
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,551
I mean, the birth of her
ex-husband's love child

205
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,657
is a bit of a stretch--
but I know, baby.

206
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,060
(sighs)

207
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,832
Well?

208
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,561
It was... crazy in there,

209
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,056
but...

210
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,497
I threw up,
and now I feel better.

211
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,673
Where were you?

212
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,801
In the can.
I knew I was gonna urp,

213
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,836
so I put this on over my suit.

214
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,872
Number 31 won't let me
in the delivery room.

215
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,677
We're gonna need a name
eventually.

216
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,379
Mr. Stinson?

217
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,310
Yes?
Congratulations.

218
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,875
Congratulations because

219
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,524
the blood test came back
and I'm not the father?!

220
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,650
Happy Not a Father's Day!

221
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,716
No. Congratulations.

222
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:42,985
It's a girl.

223
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,163
Would you like to meet her?

224
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,731
Nah, I'm good.

225
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,199
I don't...
Oh, just go
meet your daughter!

226
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,299
This is Ellie.

227
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,412
I'll give you guys
a minute.

228
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,553
*

229
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,160
You are the love
of my life.

230
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,871
(trembling breath)

231
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,899
Everything I have...

232
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,767
and everything I am...

233
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,411
...is yours.

234
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,954
(gasping breath)

235
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Forever.

236
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:56,903
What?

237
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,300
Do I have stuff in my teeth?

238
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,602
Give me your
engagement ring back.

239
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,774
Just because I have
stuff in my teeth?

240
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,473
We-we can work through this.

241
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,674
(laughs):
Just give it back.

242
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,681
(clears throat)

243
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,581
Five years is past the statute
of limitations on proposals.

244
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,024
If you don't get married in that
time, you have to re-propose.

245
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,086
Will you...

246
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,620
Yes. Yes, you silly man.

247
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,815
Let me finish.

248
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:23,856
Will you...

249
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:24,891
Yes! Sorry.

250
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,429
Yes.

251
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,359
Will y...

252
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,125
Will you marry me...

253
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,833
on Thursday?

254
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,965
I called your office--
you got nothing on Thursday.

255
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,642
Will you marry me on Thursday?

256
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,640
Yes.

257
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,171
(laughs)

258
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,052
(groans)

259
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,449
Same ring.

260
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,550
(laughs)

261
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,622
LILY:
I can't believe it.

262
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,991
It's Ted Mosby's wedding day!

263
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,861
Yes! After only seven
years and two kids.

264
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,460
Guys, am I rushing
into this?

265
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,661
Whoa.

266
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,493
Oh, buddy, are you okay?

267
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,858
So tired.

268
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,997
Baby no sleepy.

269
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,973
Barney dying.

270
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,641
Well, we're
staying out till
3:00 a.m. tonight.

271
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,210
9:45!

272
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,040
Seriously, though,
I am so proud of you.

273
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,136
Not that
you're a dad.

274
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,647
It's like
you're a totally

275
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,048
different pers...
Whoa!

276
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,180
And... we're back.

277
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,817
Hey.

278
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,193
Hi.
What to join us for shots?

279
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,591
(chuckles):
Shots?

280
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,892
Before lunch on a Thursday?

281
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,855
It's like you're trying
to make bad decisions.

282
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,025
You young ladies
need to go home,

283
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,734
put on some
decent clothes

284
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,736
and take a good hard look
at your lives. Get!

285
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,200
Call your parents--

286
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,807
they're probably worried sick.

287
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,943
I have officially

288
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,136
seen everything.

289
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,623
Not everything.

290
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,334
Hi.
Hi.

291
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,632
I-I know I've...
missed a couple lately, but...

292
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,495
we said we'd always be there
for the big moments.

293
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,305
Aw, crap.

294
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,540
Mascara running.

295
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,984
Nobody let her
out of your sight.

296
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,050
Hi, Daddy.
Whoa.

297
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,652
Look, Robin,
I'm really happy to see you,

298
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,493
but I don't think of you
that way anymore.

299
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,389
No, dummy,
you had a kid.

300
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,991
Congrats.
Right, yeah.

301
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,763
Thanks. A kid.

302
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,331
I'm tired.

303
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,959
Oh.
But, uh,

304
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,634
she's awesome.
Yeah?

305
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,932
Yeah.

306
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,834
Daddy's home.

307
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,971
Mm.

308
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,743
Judge Fudge? Hey?
(laughs)
Hey...

309
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,342
Actually, um, little
announcement for everybody.

310
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,484
I'm gonna be running
for State Supreme Court.

311
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,409
Yeah. So if
everything goes well,

312
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,305
in a couple of months,
you won't be calling me

313
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,147
Judge Fudge anymore.

314
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,322
You'll be calling me
Fudge Supreme.

315
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,621
(others chuckling)

316
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,461
The man of the hour.

317
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,660
Yeah.

318
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,291
You RSVP'd no.

319
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,926
I did.

320
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:19,402
But someone pretty persuasive
talked me into it.

321
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,737
*

322
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,644
Sorry. I know
it's bad luck

323
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,683
to see the bride
in her dress.

324
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,379
Worth it.

325
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,476
But I couldn't miss this.

326
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,776
I want to get
a picture.

327
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,117
Get in! I want to take
a picture of you guys.

328
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,993
Come on, get together.

329
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,362
Are you ready?

330
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,490
All right, get in.
All right.
All right.

331
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,185
One, two,

332
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,727
three.

333
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,031
(shutter clicks)

334
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,403
*

335
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,073
Hey. Hey, you kids.

336
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,665
Yeah, you didn't sound
a thousand there.

337
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,350
Do you have any idea
what happened right here

338
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,808
in this very bar?

339
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,646
No. What happened?

340
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,721
(chuckles)

341
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,520
Just...

342
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,694
...just all kinds of stuff.

343
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,330
A toast.

344
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,831
Mm-hmm.

345
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,232
Okay, first off...

346
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,104
to everyone at
this table...

347
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,074
...I love you
guys so much,

348
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,342
I can't even...

349
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,210
Just move to
the second part.
Okay, okay.

350
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,069
Secondly, to Ted...

351
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:34,937
Don't say it.

352
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,005
OTHERS:
...Evelyn Mosby.

353
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,754
Thanks. Thank you for that.

354
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,548
A man with...

355
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,080
more emotional endurance

356
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,446
than anyone I know.

357
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,615
It was a long,

358
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,923
difficult road.

359
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,616
Thank God we
finally got here.

360
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:52,628
Hear, hear.

361
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,859
OTHERS:
Hear, hear.

362
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,433
NARRATOR:
Aunt Lily wasn't wrong.

363
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,772
It was at times
a long, difficult road.

364
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,868
But I'm glad it was
long and difficult,

365
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,240
because if I hadn't gone
through hell to get there,

366
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,941
the lesson might
not have been as clear.

367
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,813
You see, kids,
right from the moment

368
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,811
I met your mom, I knew...

369
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,553
I have to love this woman
as much as I can

370
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,750
for as long as I can, and
I can never stop loving her,

371
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,553
not even for a second.

372
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,815
I carried that lesson with me
through every

373
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,164
stupid fight we ever had,

374
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,791
every 5:00 a.m.
Christmas morning,

375
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,496
every sleepy Sunday afternoon,

376
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,759
through every speed bump.

377
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,227
Every pang of jealousy

378
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,465
or boredom or uncertainty
that came our way,

379
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,242
I carried that lesson with me.

380
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,911
And I carried it with me
when she got sick.

381
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,180
Even then, in what can only
be called the worst of times,

382
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,022
all I could do was look at her
and thank God,

383
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:52,648
thank every god there is,
or ever was, or will be,

384
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,185
and the whole universe,

385
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,591
and anyone else
I could possibly thank...

386
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,494
* Will I see you tonight?

387
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,256
...that I saw
that beautiful girl

388
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,525
on that train platform,

389
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,334
and that I had the guts
to stand up,

390
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:11,167
walk over to her,
tap her on the shoulder,

391
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,114
open my mouth,

392
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,310
and speak.

393
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,142
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.

394
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,877
I'm the...
The best man. Yeah.
Get in here,

395
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,981
get in here,
get in here.
Oh, thanks. Here, let me.

396
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,384
Oh, okay. Thank you.

397
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,815
Great show tonight. Yeah.
Oh, thank you.

398
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,821
You're Cindy's
ex-roommate, right?

399
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,323
Yeah. And you are the professor.

400
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,956
I took one of your classes.

401
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,791
Really? Which one?
Mm-hmm.

402
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,056
Econ 305.

403
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,195
Econ 305.
I don't teach...

404
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,470
Oh, no.

405
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,868
Oh, yeah.

406
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,039
Excuse me, I'm gonna jump
onto the tracks now.
No.

407
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,639
No, no, no, don't.
You were great,
you were great.

408
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,311
Wait a second.

409
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,239
This is my umbrella.

410
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:52,305
I left this umbrella
at Cindy's-- you totally
stole my umbrella.

411
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,675
(laughs):
What? No, I didn't.

412
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,983
This is my umbrella.
I bought this.

413
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,485
Excuse me. It even
has my initials

414
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,248
on it right here: T.M.

415
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,687
Ted Mosby.

416
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,691
Yeah. Look again,
Ted Mosby.

417
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,093
Those are my
initials: T.M.

418
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,096
Tracy McConnell.
Um, no, Tracy McConnell,

419
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,899
it's T.M.--
Totally My umbrella.

420
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,271
Uh, you're T.M.--
Terribly Mistaken,

421
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:17,601
because this umbrella has
always belonged T.M.:

422
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,767
To Me.

423
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,206
(laughs)

424
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:25,111
Although... I did lose it
for a few years there.

425
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,875
Um... so, I went to
this dance club...

426
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,124
On St. Patrick's Day.

427
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:32,289
...on St. Patrick's Day.

428
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,889
And you left it there.

429
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,890
And I left it there.

430
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,692
And you never thought
you'd see it again.

431
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,155
And I never thought
I'd see it again.

432
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,471
Funny how sometimes you just...

433
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,140
find things.

434
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,709
* Will I see you tonight?

435
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,140
Hi.

436
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,305
(laughs):
Hi.

437
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,253
*

438
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,209
* Every night

439
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,248
* It's just the same

440
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:09,662
* All upon a downtown train.

441
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,828
And that, kids...

442
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,599
is how I met your mother.

443
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,498
That's it?

444
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,600
That's it.

445
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,572
No. I don't buy it.

446
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,271
That is not the reason
you made us listen to this.

447
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,644
Oh, really?

448
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,972
Then what's the reason?

449
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,607
Let's look at
the facts here.

450
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:33,152
You made us sit down
and listen to this story
about how you met mom,

451
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,350
yet mom's hardly
in the story. No.

452
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:38,083
This is a story
about how

453
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,617
you're totally in love
with Aunt Robin.

454
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,152
And you're thinking
about asking her out,

455
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,358
and you want to know
if we're okay with it.

456
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,790
I can't believe this.

457
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,464
I kept this story short
and to the point,

458
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,455
and you guys still missed it.

459
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,767
The point of the story
is that...

460
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,699
Is that you totally,
totally, totally have
the hots for Aunt Robin.

461
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:56,435
No, I don't.

462
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,939
Yes, you do.

463
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,440
You're grounded.

464
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,812
Wow, you are really
into Aunt Robin.

465
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,810
You're grounded, too.

466
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,310
Okay, suppose I were interested
in Aunt Robin in that way--

467
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,377
it's not like
I'd do anything about it.

468
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,676
I got you guys to think about.
My gosh,

469
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:12,988
we lov Aunt Robin.

470
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,889
Whenever she comes over
for dinner, you guys

471
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,821
are so obvious.

472
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:17,986
Come on, Dad.

473
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,664
Mom's been gone
for six years now.

474
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,403
It's time.

475
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,670
What, I just...
just call her up on the phone

476
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,969
and ask her out on a date?

477
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,171
Yes.
Yes.

478
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,003
And that... that's something

479
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,308
you guys would want?

480
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,510
Yes!
Yes!

481
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,352
All right, I'll give her a call.

482
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,982
Do it.
I am.

483
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,816
Call her.
I'm calli her.

484
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:46,852
Great.

485
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,016
Here I go.

486
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,858
Or...

487
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,203
*

488
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,500
All right, home sweet home.

489
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,242
Oh. Wait one second.

490
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,699
Okay.

491
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,536
Stay.

492
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:07,773
(sighs):
We'll work on that.

493
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,607
(intercom chimes)

494
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,552
Television, display
front door security.

495
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,449
(sighs)
Television, dis...

496
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:15,721
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

497
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,878
* May come and go

498
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:21,217
* Our crooked dreams

499
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:24,264
* Will always flow

500
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,291
* Remember

501
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,725
* Remem...

502
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,460
* Ber

503
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:33,227
* All we fight for

504
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,869
* Remember

505
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,314
* Remem...

506
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,640
* Ber

507
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:46,405
* All we fight for

508
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,275
* Remember

509
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,247
* Remem...

510
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,115
* Ber

511
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:57,963
* All we fight for

512
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:10,471
* Oh, oh, oh, oh...
