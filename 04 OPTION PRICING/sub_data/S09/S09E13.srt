00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:04,373
NARRATOR:
Kids, when your
Uncle Marshall's bus broke down

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:05,865
five miles away
from the Farhampton Inn,

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,136
he made a vow.

4
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:09,205
I can walk that far.

5
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:12,983
Yes. It was another
exciting installment of...

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:19,193
* Marshall versus the machines

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,390
* Our hero starts his journey

8
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,822
* With steely-eyed resolve,
but let's *

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,887
* Skip ahead to later

10
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:27,896
* With a slow dissolve

11
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,858
* So tired, dehydrated

12
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,728
* Not making any sense

13
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,937
* And wait a second,
why is Bigfoot *

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,010
* Standing by that fence?

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,109
Oh. Hey.

16
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,011
You didn't see this.

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,112
* I'm not hallucinating

18
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,376
* Bigfoot really exists

19
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:51,245
* But everyone knows
he quit smoking years ago *

20
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,015
* Oh, crap, I'm losing it...

21
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,494
(vehicle approaching)

22
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,755
(horn honks)
WOMAN:
Excuse me. Hey.

23
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,564
You guys need a lift?

24
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,266
NARRATOR: And that's how
Marshall met your mother.

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,549
This is great.
The whole gang together.

26
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,252
Well, almost
the whole gang.

27
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,255
Yeah, there's just one beloved
piece of the puzzle missing.

28
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,887
A bottle of 30-year
Glen McKenna scotch.

29
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,585
Mmm...
(slurping)

30
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,997
NARRATOR:
So far, that weekend

31
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,898
had been fatal
for not just one...

32
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,901
but two bottles of $600 scotch

33
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,803
intended
for a special wedding toast.

34
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,736
Also, where the
hell is Marshall?

35
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,482
I still can't believe he took
the judgeship behind my back.

36
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,109
Look, I know this is messy, my
dream versus Marshall's dream.

37
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,416
I won't force you guys
to choose sides.

38
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,348
Good, because I totally side
with Marshall.

39
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:59,024
That would've been so awkward.

40
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,192
Hey, let's go see if they have
any Glen McKenna up at the bar.

41
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:02,622
Okay.

42
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,186
Hey, look, don't be mad.

43
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,085
Barney just thinks
that if he has a judge friend,

44
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,326
he can get all of his citations
for public urination thrown out.

45
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,533
How often does Barney pee
in public?

46
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,995
A lot.

47
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,544
But don't worry.

48
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,839
I'm on your side.

49
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,210
Aw...
(chuckles)

50
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,509
What's poppin', mi amigas?

51
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,141
ROBIN:
Oh, boy, who's this idiot?

52
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:27,047
LILY: And which one of us is he
gonna try to make the sex on?

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,020
You both look beautiful tonight.

54
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,389
ROBIN:
Bro, going for the tricycle.

55
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:35,619
(scoffs) Can you imagine having
a three-way with this creep?

56
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,886
(chuckles)
Yeah, right.

57
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,564
You, me and this guy,

58
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,532
naked, going at it.

59
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:44,161
Then he gets tired and it's
just you and me going at it.

60
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,328
ROBIN: Uh, Lily...
That'd be so stupid.

61
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,467
So stupid...

62
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,643
ROBIN:
Um, okay, I'll shoot him down.

63
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,912
By the way, I am so psyched
for the wedding tomorrow, Robin.

64
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,742
I'm truly honored
that you and Barney

65
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,077
asked me to be a part of it.

66
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,551
We're honored...

67
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,251
you're here...

68
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,321
...valued invitee.
(chuckles)

69
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,493
(chuckles)

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,390
ROBIN:
Help me. Who is this?

71
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,022
LILY: Maybe he's one of your
long-lost Canadian cousins?

72
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,858
Uh, do you happen to have all
of your fingers and teeth?

73
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,395
Uh... yeah.
(chuckles)

74
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,201
ROBIN:
Not one of my cousins.

75
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,601
Hey, thanks again
for picking us up.

76
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,536
It's been a crazy
couple of days.

77
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,372
You can't imagine
what we've been through.

78
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:27,507
Wait, let me guess.

79
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,511
You were visiting a relative,

80
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,384
maybe... your mother?

81
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:33,553
And I'm getting

82
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,021
a Midwest vibe,

83
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,678
somewhere like...
Wisconsin...

84
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,017
(scoffs)
...no, Minnesota?

85
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,621
Wow.

86
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,693
You're-you're, like,
really good at this.

87
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,362
You're planning an overseas trip
with your wife.

88
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,292
I'm seeing a...

89
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,527
a feisty redhead who loves art.

90
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,432
She just got a job

91
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,803
in Europe, maybe France?

92
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,231
No. Italy?

93
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,796
(gasps)

94
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,304
Total shot in the dark, but...

95
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,467
Rome?

96
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,380
Maybe I'll just, like...

97
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,580
I'll get out
right here.
(doors lock)

98
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,751
You're not going anywhere.

99
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,548
No, I'm just messin' with ya.

100
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,983
I rode the train with your wife.

101
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,488
She told me all about you.

102
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,650
You must be Marshall.

103
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,986
Um...

104
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,397
I was checking on the baby.

105
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,999
(laughs)

106
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,600
(laughing): Wait-wait a minute,
wait a minute.

107
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,502
So you guys both got locked out

108
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,744
on the roof in your pajamas?

109
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,409
You guys are hilarious
and adorable!

110
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,410
LILY:
Any idea who this guy is?

111
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,312
ROBIN:
No, but I like that he gets

112
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:38,684
how hilarious
and adorable we are!

113
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,812
LILY:
We are hilarious and adorable!

114
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,618
(laughs)
I'll get the next round.

115
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,980
Oh, thanks.

116
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,347
Thanks, Lil.

117
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:48,816
Hey, I'm sorry if
I barged in on you guys.

118
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,356
I can be a little overeager

119
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,431
to connect sometimes.

120
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,430
Probably because of
my childhood.

121
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,832
Right.

122
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:58,173
Because of that thing
that happened.

123
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,928
My mother died
on a hunting trip

124
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,967
when I was very young.

125
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,472
Yeah, that's it,
that's the thing.

126
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,465
Sorry, blah, too heavy!

127
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,477
(chuckles)

128
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,478
So, Robin.

129
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,809
What's going on...

130
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,353
with you?

131
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,879
Oh, nothing.

132
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,723
I mean, uh, nothing big, anyway.

133
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,118
Hey, hey, hey...

134
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,589
this is me
you're talking to.

135
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,163
Well, there is
this thing with Lily...

136
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,689
You know, Ted,

137
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,394
if you really want
to get a bottle

138
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,326
of Glen McKenna 30-year
for Barney,

139
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,961
I got that last one at
the Farhampton Liquor Store.

140
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,227
The security there
is a total joke!

141
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,225
No, see, I don't
want to know that.

142
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,737
I won't be an accomplice
to grand larceny.

143
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,310
I am not confirming
or denying a thing.

144
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,339
But there's a really high window
in the storage room

145
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,635
and if you climb up...

146
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,546
La la la la la,
I'm not listening!

147
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:45,848
I love Barney,

148
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,309
but I'm not going
to jail for him.

149
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,577
What? Really?
Why not?

150
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:49,816
I'd go to jail for you.

151
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,420
No, you wouldn't.
Yes, I would.

152
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:52,522
Going to jail for
your best friend?

153
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:53,723
That's the dream.

154
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:54,724
Really?

155
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,215
That's the dream?

156
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:59,386
Yeah, it's the most noble--
nay, bro-ble--

157
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,657
thing a bro can do
for a fellow bro.
Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,325
So, yes, Ted, that's the dream.

159
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,674
You're too liberal with the
phrase: "That's the dream."

160
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,340
Name one other time
I've said that!

161
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,268
A suit made of prosciutto
so you can eat your way naked,

162
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,573
"That's the dream."

163
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,765
A pack of lions
fighting a tyrannosaurus,

164
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:14,837
"That's the dream."

165
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,935
Being able to take

166
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,076
a whole year's worth of dumps

167
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,680
in one, nonstop 24-hour period

168
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,852
then not having to dump again

169
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,850
for the rest of the year,

170
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,081
"That's the dream."

171
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,515
I never said Dump Day
was the dream.

172
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:27,052
I said science is
this close to a pill.

173
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,057
There can only be
one "the dream"!

174
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,219
You're saying it's going
to jail for a bro?

175
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,388
You're comfortable
with that being

176
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,156
the one and only
dream, forever?

177
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,432
Yes.

178
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,774
Great, now you can never
use that phrase again.

179
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,569
And for me,
that's the dream.

180
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,041
Hey, Lily, Robin just
told me about Italy!

181
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,570
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be great.

182
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,976
Well, that is, if I can
convince my husband

183
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,878
to keep his promise
and move there with me.

184
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,280
Robin, I know

185
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,111
you told me you want
Marshall to win,

186
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,306
but I don't know.

187
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,117
I gotta side
with Lily on this one.

188
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,279
Later, skaters.

189
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,461
Thanks again
for saving us.

190
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,431
Well, I don't normally
stop like that,

191
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,429
but I just had to for the cutest
hitchhiker in the world!

192
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,602
Thank you.

193
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,501
Oh, you were talking
about Marvin.

194
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,673
(Marvin coos)
Sorry, it's been
a really, really long day.

195
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,473
When we get there,
I'll buy you a drink.

196
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:20,605
Thank you,
but, um, after I drop you off,

197
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,911
I'm heading back to the city.

198
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,183
What?
I thought you said that

199
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,151
your-your band's
playing the wedding.

200
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,078
Why are you leaving?

201
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,283
The lead singer.

202
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,354
He's the devil.

203
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,821
He's a total fire-starter.

204
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,950
He just ruins
people's lives

205
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,494
for his own amusement.

206
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,450
You know, he will walk
up to two friends,

207
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,158
he will find the one thing

208
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,289
that will destroy their
friendship and just-- poof!--

209
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,956
burn it to the ground.

210
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,264
Wow.

211
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,525
What's his name?

212
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,502
What's poppin',
mi amigos?

213
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,174
THE MOTHER:
Darren.

214
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,307
You're rooting
for Marshall?!

215
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,282
Well, why don't you just get

216
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,480
a Team Marshall T-shirt?

217
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,482
What size are you?

218
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,513
Extra-traitor?

219
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:02,318
No. No, okay...

220
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,479
What I said was...

221
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,018
See, all I meant was...

222
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,693
God, how did we get here?

223
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,021
That's the question
you're left asking yourself.

224
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,657
So here's how
he does it:

225
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,332
First, he makes you
feel like you are

226
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,661
the most hilarious

227
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,996
and adorable person
in the world...

228
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,501
You guys are
hilarious

229
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,733
and adorable!

230
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,368
TED:
I like that he gets

231
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,502
how hilarious
and adorable we are.

232
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,738
BARNEY:
We are hilarious and adorable.

233
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,244
(laughing)

234
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,505
Next, he finds some flimsy
connection with you

235
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:31,754
based on where you're from...

236
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:32,849
Cleveland?
Yeah.

237
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,510
Galluci's serves the

238
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,718
best pepperoni
bread!
Best pepperoni bread!

239
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,419
And Staten Island!

240
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,920
Guys getting in fights
on their front lawns!

241
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,763
It's like you're
from there!

242
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,189
(laughing)

243
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,163
TED:
This guy's awesome!

244
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,762
BARNEY:
So awesome!

245
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,504
TED:
I'd totally go to jail for him.

246
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,058
BARNEY:
That hurts.

247
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,528
Next, he tells you
a "deep personal secret"

248
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,198
that is usually
the tragic back-story

249
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,496
from an animated kid's film.

250
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,107
My mother died on
a hunting trip.

251
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,510
It's often Bambi.

252
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,011
My father was
betrayed and killed

253
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,054
by a trusted advisor.

254
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,719
Sometimes he'll throw a little
Lion King in there.

255
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,779
I have no family.

256
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,588
But tonight...

257
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,550
I think maybe
I found two brothers.

258
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,218
(sobs)

259
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,226
Sorry, blah, too heavy.

260
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,528
(crying):
That's okay, man.

261
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,289
(crying):
Let me get you a drink.

262
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,258
THE MOTHER:
And then, once
your guard is down,

263
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,796
the emotional
prostate exam begins...

264
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,973
So, Ted,

265
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,570
what's going on...
with you?

266
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:32,713
Well... I mean,
there was this thing...

267
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,070
Never mind.

268
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,477
Hey, hey, hey...

269
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,648
This is me you're talking to.

270
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,380
Look, all I meant

271
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,384
was that there are
two sides here.

272
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,376
Yes...

273
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,217
Italy is your dream,

274
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,763
but being a judge is Marshall's.

275
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:48,788
Well, that

276
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:49,762
and teaching prop comedy

277
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,060
to a tropical bird.

278
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,391
Parrot Top has nothing
to do with this!

279
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,296
I don't need
objectivity.

280
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,298
You're my best friend;
I just need your support.

281
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,971
I understand.
You got it.

282
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,330
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

283
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,438
Oh, me, too.

284
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,999
Forgot my phone.

285
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,907
I'm sorry, you guys are probably
talking wedding details.

286
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,509
I mean, no maid of honor's
gonna steal the spotlight

287
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,940
with her own problem

288
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,236
on the bride's big weekend,
am I right?

289
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,977
Keep it real, homies!

290
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,175
You know, he is right.

291
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,016
Why is this all about you?

292
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,321
I mean, you have
been preoccupied

293
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,592
with Marshall all weekend.

294
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,160
I have not!

295
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,959
You have been sleeping
with a doll made of cushions

296
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,291
that you named after him.

297
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,625
Not true!

298
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,960
After we do our business,

299
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,495
I make Marshpillow
sleep on the couch!

300
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,629
So there!
Oh, my God, that
is so ridiculous!

301
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,025
So, what did Darren
do to you?

302
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,336
Well, a few years ago,
I started this band.

303
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,098
And, you know, it was a goof--

304
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,167
it was just me and a couple
of dorks from business school.

305
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,807
I'm actually embarrassed
to tell you our name.

306
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,513
I had an all-lawyer funk band

307
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,814
called The Funk, The Whole Funk,
And Nothing But The Funk.

308
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,317
Oh, I now feel very safe
talking about my band--

309
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,519
Super-Freak-Onomics.

310
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,390
Nice.
(laughs)
Anyway,

311
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,889
I brought Darren in
to split lead vocals,

312
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,322
and he took over.

313
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,226
You know, first
he took away my solos,

314
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,888
then I got demoted
to backup vocals,

315
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,127
and now the only time
I use a mic

316
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,072
is after Darren's first
false exit, when I say,

317
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,028
"Do you guys want more Darren?"

318
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,297
And then today,

319
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,295
I found this
ad online.

320
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,668
"Ass player wanted"?

321
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:14,707
Move your thumb.

322
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,412
Oh, "bass player wanted."

323
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,053
Wait, he was gonna kick you
out of your own band?

324
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,379
Yeah.

325
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,483
But instead... I quit.

326
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,516
You quit?! That's it?

327
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,922
But it's your band--
you must be avenged!

328
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,655
(laughs):
Funny you should say that,

329
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,729
because as I was leaving
the hotel, I ran into someone.

330
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,560
You need to steal
this douche monkey's van.

331
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,926
Aldrin Justice, nice!

332
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,866
Your wife is cool.

333
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,941
Oh, the coolest.

334
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,544
Hey, did she, um,
happen to mention

335
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,042
the fact
that I'm sort of ruining

336
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,514
her dream of moving to Italy?

337
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,281
Uh, yeah, that did come up.

338
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,651
You need to steal
this douche monkey's van.

339
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,722
And then run

340
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,950
my husband over with it.

341
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,416
I think you've got
a tough talk coming.

342
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,894
Yeah, well, so do you.

343
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,863
When we get
to the Farhampton Inn,

344
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,692
you're gonna go in there and
you're gonna stand up to Darren.

345
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,356
Oh, come on,
I Aldrin Justiced him.

346
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,896
Yeah, but I bet
you're just gonna give

347
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,631
this van right back to him.

348
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,695
I mean, were you at least
gonna pee in it a little?

349
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,474
I was gonna gas it up
and get it washed.

350
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,205
You're too nice.

351
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,810
I'm the same way.

352
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,712
Sometimes you got
to get in there

353
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,153
and-and stand up for yourself.

354
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,748
I always cave and side
with the other person.

355
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,651
I can't handle confrontation.

356
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,752
Yes, you can.

357
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,224
You make some good points.

358
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,092
Look.

359
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,061
I don't know you, but I can tell
that you're strong.

360
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,460
That's your band.

361
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,802
Don't let Darren steal it away.

362
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,133
(sighs)

363
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,004
No, there's
no defeating the devil.

364
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,603
He's someone else's problem now.

365
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,102
I'm sorry
if I've been

366
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,438
distracted this weekend.

367
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,772
Oh, let's not fight anymore,
okay?

368
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,438
Oh, good, Robin,
you finally told Lily

369
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,807
you feel like she's
abandoning you as a friend

370
00:12:58,846 --> 00:12:59,976
by going to Italy.

371
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,823
Honesty is progress.
Stay gold.

372
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,254
I'm not...

373
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,685
Ooh, Ted.
(indistinct chatter)

374
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,749
When you move to Chicago,

375
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,317
you got to try Gazzola's pizza.

376
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,617
Namaste, hermanos.

377
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,099
You're moving to Chicago?

378
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,704
Is that even a real place?

379
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,266
It's a style of pizza.

380
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,035
Ted, you can't live in a pizza.

381
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,114
I got an amazing
job offer there.

382
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,482
Look, Lily knows,
but Marshall and Robin don't.

383
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,781
So please keep it quiet.

384
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,122
(loudly):
You're moving to Chicago?!

385
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,549
He-he's moving to Chicago!

386
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,286
When do you move?

387
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,661
At least tell me it's not
until next year or something.

388
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,630
It's not until...

389
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,729
Monday.

390
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,030
Monday?!

391
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,533
So you are just gonna disappear
the day after my wedding?

392
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,336
After ten years
of being best friends?

393
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,469
Well, actually, Marshall's my...
Don't even think about it!

394
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,465
That's fair enough.
You are gonna give me
one day's notice?

395
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,238
Well, I didn't want to upset you
on your wedding weekend.

396
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,677
No, it's good.

397
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:06,982
It'll be easy to say good-bye

398
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,724
now that I know how much
I mean to you.

399
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,118
Well... (sighs)

400
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,655
Hey.

401
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,589
Hey.

402
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,925
I was...

403
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,230
I was never really
rooting for Marshall.

404
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,372
I was rooting
to not lose my best friend.

405
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,099
But that's selfish.

406
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,735
No matter where you go,

407
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,039
I'm in your corner
and I always will be.

408
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,042
And to prove it...

409
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,606
What are you gonna do
with Marshpillow?

410
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,177
Hold his arms back

411
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,345
while you beat the goose down
out of this bastard.

412
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,054
'Cause that's
what best friends do.

413
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,917
Thanks, it-it's not gonna help.

414
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,456
Try it. One punch.

415
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,900
Ooh, that felt good.

416
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,129
Mm-hmm.

417
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,434
(grunting)
Yeah, that's it, sweetheart.

418
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,825
Head, body, head.
Head, body, head.

419
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,244
Barney, wait, wait!

420
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,613
Your friendship is
important to me.

421
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,140
I swear on my mother's...

422
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:10,536
No, I swear to God.

423
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,277
No... I swear to Hef.

424
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,752
(gasps)
Don't take that name in vain.

425
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,491
If someone is important to you,
you tell them you're moving.

426
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,988
I'm just some guy you
used to know back in New York.

427
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,762
Hey.

428
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,996
Whoa.

429
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,498
How...?

430
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,795
(crashing, glass breaking)

431
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,336
That's a $600 bottle.

432
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,572
Ted, that's grand larceny.

433
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,478
You really could go
to jail for this.

434
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,610
That's the dream.

435
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,116
So...

436
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,849
you're moving to Chicago.

437
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,353
I'm going to Chicago.

438
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,156
Why? I know
Marshall and Lily might leave,

439
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,018
but it's only a year,
and in the meantime,

440
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,757
we'll still see each other
all the time.

441
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,131
You, me, Robin...

442
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,655
Oh.

443
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,069
I need a new start.

444
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,543
I'm gonna miss you.

445
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,572
I'm gonna miss you so much.

446
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,350
Well, here we are.

447
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,480
Good luck in there.

448
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,684
Thank you.

449
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,275
And don't worry,

450
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,647
at the reception, I'll yell,

451
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,845
"The lead singer
sucks skunk junk,"

452
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,157
after every song.

453
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,189
(laughing)

454
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,193
I'll come up with something

455
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,734
better than "skunk junk."

456
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,789
No, no.

457
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,096
"Skunk junk" is pretty solid.

458
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,504
You can't yell that
at the lead singer.

459
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,843
Because I don't suck skunk junk.

460
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,510
Wait, are you saying...?

461
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,078
I'm coming in. Darren and I
are gonna have a chat

462
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,908
about my band!

463
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,342
(whoops)

464
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,578
MARVIN:
Skunk junk.

465
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,685
For the record...
Uh-huh.

466
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,689
his first word

467
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,391
was "Mommy."

468
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,563
Mm-hmm.

469
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,391
This is my band. I started it.

470
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:11,227
And if anyone is getting
fired here, it's you, Darren.

471
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,704
So hit the bricks,

472
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,402
s-skunk...

473
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,344
junk.

474
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,609
Is that even
a little bit intimidating?

475
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,008
Nope, and the
knitting's not helping.

476
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,010
I'm sorry, I just met this baby
and he needs a hat.

477
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,913
You can't fire Darren.

478
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,945
He gets how hilarious
and adorable I am.

479
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,281
Plus it is so inspiring

480
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:35,118
how he overcame his mother
being eaten by a barracuda.

481
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,115
Gah! It's Finding Nemo.

482
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,427
(sighs)

483
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,728
That's new.

484
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,563
There's no defeating the devil.

485
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,626
New plan.
Linus, if at any point

486
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,625
tonight you see me
with an empty glass...

487
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,067
Kennedy package.

488
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,572
It's a very popular choice
this weekend.

489
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,413
Thank you, Linus.

490
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,639
(grunting)
Yup.

491
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,405
Uh, Lily?

492
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,475
Lily.

493
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,123
MARSHALL:
Lily.

494
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,231
Pause?

495
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,533
Pause.

496
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,502
Oh...

497
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,681
Thank you, Linus.

498
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,609
Mm-hmm.

499
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,184
There are real villains
in this world.

500
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:38,124
But they don't always get
real justice, do they?

501
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,791
You want to believe
karma's gonna get them.

502
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,190
All right, who wants a drink?

503
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,292
I'm stealing.

504
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,193
(all cheer)

505
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,785
But karma doesn't

506
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,427
always come through.

507
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,302
I love how strong
your marriage is.

508
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,801
And you don't need
to lose weight, Louise,

509
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,372
no matter what he told me.

510
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,471
Catch you on the flip-flop,
muchachos.

511
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,313
Oh!
(groans)

512
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,538
(guffaws)

513
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,342
Sorry, mi amigos.

514
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,684
I guess you have to accept
that sometimes in life...

515
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,218
...you just don't get
that knockout punch.

516
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,218
(punch smacking)

517
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:12,149
(grunt)

518
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,657
(all laughing)

519
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,289
Hey, can I get some ice?

520
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,785
The best man just punched me
in the face for no reason.

521
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:21,827
(laughs)

522
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,731
Oh, what, that's funny to you?

523
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,003
You know what? I quit.

524
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,831
You can have
your stupid band back.

525
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,866
I miss being in a band where
people are decent to each other

526
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,373
and there's no drama.

527
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,665
I'm going back
to the new Guns N' Roses.

528
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,976
Linus, whoever that best man is,

529
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,321
I would like to buy him a double
of your finest scotch.

530
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,879
* You started a band

531
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,887
* That was cool for a while

532
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,390
* But it turned pretty bland

533
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,833
* I started a fight

534
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,060
* With a neighbor next door

535
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,695
* And his pesky wife...

536
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,401
Here you go.

537
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,273
Is this from one of you guys?

538
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,072
Nah.
Uh-uh.
No.

539
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,743
Okay.

540
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,612
* And hate even more
when you're not *

541
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,880
Well... this is incredible.

542
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,008
What is this?

543
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,182
It's the Glen McKenna 35-year.

544
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,111
Wait a minute.

545
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,516
This whole time, you had
Glen McKenna 35-year?

546
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,919
Why didn't you say something?

547
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,790
You didn't ask about the 35.

548
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,749
NARRATOR: And, kids,
that's the first drink

549
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,318
your mother ever bought me.

550
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:34,401
Hey, Barney, I'm so sorry
I missed your rehearsal dinner.

551
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,944
Oh, that's okay.

552
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,368
We didn't even know
you weren't here, jerk.

553
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,266
Listen, I know that it can't
make up for being late,

554
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,238
but I did get you
a-a special gift.

555
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,136
Well, hand it over, fathead.

556
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,247
Well, you might want to wait
until after the wedding photos.

557
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,880
Hand it over now, travel breath.

558
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,076
Okay, Barney, I'll hand it over.

559
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,315
Oh, God, it's the next slap!

560
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,224
I don't know why
I was so obnoxious.

561
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,285
