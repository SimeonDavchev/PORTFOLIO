NARRATOR:
Kids, it was two days

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,068
before Barney
and Robin's wedding,

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:08,507
and everything was going off
without a hitch.

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,742
TED:
Ah.

5
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:11,147
Been waiting for the
perfect time for this,

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,809
and, my friend,
that time is...

7
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,246
I saw you and Robin
at the carousel.

8
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:18,423
(bottle shatters)
Okay, there was
one slight hitch.

9
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,852
BARNEY:
She called me to help her,

10
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,088
and there you were

11
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,323
in the rain

12
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,027
holding hands with my fiancÃ©e.

13
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:30,357
What up?

14
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,028
Nothing up.

15
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,026
Everything down.

16
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,997
All parts of me down.

17
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,095
Look,

18
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,567
you were busy,
so I-I...

19
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,766
I went to the park
to help her look

20
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,037
for this locket
she buried years ago.

21
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,875
She couldn't find it,
she got upset,

22
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,780
I held her hand. End of story.

23
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,848
Cool! I just wanted
to air that out.

24
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,353
You know, bro to bro.

25
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,085
You're my best friend
and my best man.

26
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,291
Of course I trust you.

27
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:55,722
Oh, come on.

28
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,026
You don't have to cry about it.

29
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,688
(sobs)
It's not that.

30
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,128
That was a $600 bottle
of scotch.

31
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,865
(crying):
Oh, my God.

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,070
(both blubbering)

33
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:12,873
I hope Marshall gets here
for the rehearsal dinner.

34
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,936
Thank you, Linus.

35
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:17,254
He's somewhere in Wisconsin
in a rental car.

36
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:18,908
Hertz?
I mean, it
hurts a little

37
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,046
but I'm not gonna
cry about it. Hey!

38
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,221
We've been doing that
all afternoon.

39
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,591
ROBIN:
Oh, who's that for?

40
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,288
Marshpillow.

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,960
NARRATOR:
Kids, as you may recall,
whenever Marshall left town

42
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,059
for a few days,

43
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,130
Lily would compensate
with a body pillow

44
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,730
she dressed up
and named Marshpillow.

45
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,302
Pretty normal stuff.

46
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,630
But with Marshall stuck driving
across the country,

47
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,626
Lily decided to upgrade.

48
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:44,068
Meet Marshpillow 2.0!

49
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,474
Hey!

50
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,276
Am I on?

51
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,438
Hey, guys!

52
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,577
Hey, Marsh.
Hey, Marshall.
Hey.

53
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,411
It's like you're
really here.

54
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,845
MARSHALL:
Hey, Ted.

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,820
Can you give me a
gander of the environs?

56
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,087
Wow!

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,019
This place
looks beautif...

58
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:05,862
Wait for it.

59
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,133
He's frozen.
(Lily groans)

60
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:11,202
Same thing happened last night
at the worst possible time.

61
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:15,142
I had just gotten on all fours
and taken off my panti...

62
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,307
Now Lily's frozen.

Media Access Group at WGBH

65
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,562
This place
is beautiful!

66
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,995
Wow. Lily, it looks
like you really put

67
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,801
some time
into this, huh?

68
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,573
(chuckles)

69
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,170
Though I wonder if

70
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,402
instead of dressing up

71
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:52,807
your giant husband doll
like Malibu Ken,

72
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,040
you could've spent
a minute or two--

73
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,714
I don't know--

74
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:58,113
planning the weak ass
bachelorette party you threw me?

75
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:08,057
I-It's possible I forgot
to send out the Evite.

76
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,192
Robin!

77
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,594
Happy bachelorette party!
(chuckles)

78
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,996
You invited Patrice
to my bachelorette party?!

79
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,829
No.

80
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,165
You know, it's funny.

81
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,039
When I was planning
Barney's bachelor party,

82
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,169
I managed to wrangle
his boyhood hero, Billy Zabka,

83
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,606
from The Karate Kid.

84
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,541
But you scored Patrice.

85
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,937
I'm sorry, Robin.

86
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:35,048
I-I've just been so consumed
with our move to Rome.

87
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,022
I guess I forgot
to invite

88
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,020
the girls.

89
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,951
Yeah, Lily, I'd like
to show you how it's done.

90
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:43,057
Billy Zabka, what
a great guy.

91
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,090
Look at how thorough Ted was
planning the best man poker game

92
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,596
he's throwing for Barney.

93
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,598
Wait, I think I'm on some sort
of delay here.

94
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,801
(clears throat)
Best man visor
for the dealer.

95
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,144
Customized playing cards.

96
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,939
Barney's the king.

97
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,141
And...

98
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,372
the queens

99
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,308
are naked.

100
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,113
It was my first decree.

101
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,384
Hmm. Plus, Ted handwrote
all of the table cards

102
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,275
for the reception
in calligraphy.

103
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,287
The man's a wizard
with a pen.

104
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,619
Oh. I don't know
about all that.

105
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,724
Though I was approached

106
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,885
by the decorating committee
to make the...

107
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,134
signs for our senior prom.

108
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:22,629
I'm told they were
quite the hit.

109
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,973
(sucks air through teeth)
Hey, buddy, listen,

110
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,969
you're gonna kill me, but I
forgot to bring the table cards.

111
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,143
Uh, I'd hate to ask
you to redo them...

112
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,642
Say no more.
The best man is on it.

113
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,175
Thanks, Ted.
(scoffs)

114
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,350
S-So now the best man

115
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,020
is painstakingly handwriting
200 table cards,

116
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,520
but my maid of
honor forgot

117
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,623
to click "send"
on an Evite.

118
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,286
I didn't forget
to invite the girls

119
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,694
to your bachelorette party.

120
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,625
You have no girls!

121
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,861
(high-pitched):
What?

122
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,255
(chuckles)
What?

123
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,327
What?

124
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,967
What? I...
All my girls.

125
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,996
I gave you a list.

126
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,307
This list?

127
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,209
Yeah.

128
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,139
"Tall girl from work,

129
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,805
"mouth-breather
from coffee shop,

130
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,014
"average-sized

131
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,005
girl from that place"?

132
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,317
Ooh. Sorry I didn't
track her down.

133
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,790
She sounds great!

134
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,718
She's actually
kind of a bitch.

135
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,153
Face it, Robin.

136
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,058
You hate women, and...

137
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,890
women hate you.

138
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,130
Ted didn't go to his prom?

139
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,901
Classic.

140
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,331
While Lily was dropping the
ball as Robin's maid of honor,

141
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,497
the best man was busy
knocking it out of the park.

142
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,737
(sucks air through teeth)

143
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,171
Hey, buddy, listen,

144
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,407
my great-aunt Ida has corns
on her feet

145
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,183
and needs a first-floor room.

146
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,011
Uh, would you mind
switching rooms?

147
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,076
Say no more.
The best man is on it.

148
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,215
Thanks, Ted.

149
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,998
(shouts)

150
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,499
(whoops)
(sucks air through teeth)
Hey, buddy, listen,

151
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,173
the wedding doves
got here early,

152
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,940
and I don't know
where to put 'em...

153
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,609
Say no more.
The best man is on it!

154
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,039
Thanks, Ted.

155
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,443
(cooing)
Poor guys.

156
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:18,006
All cooped up.

157
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:22,845
I guess there's no harm in
letting you out for a bit, huh?

158
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,023
They carpet-bombed
my entire room.

159
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,452
Wish I'd closed

160
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,057
my suitcase.

161
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,089
And my mouth.

162
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,625
(sucks air through teeth)
Hey, buddy, listen,

163
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:38,272
I see you wrote "N-O-period"
instead of the number sign.

164
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,228
I'm worried that might
confuse the guests...
Say no more.

165
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,937
The best man is on it.

166
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,399
Thanks, Ted.
(knocking)

167
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,207
Here they are.

168
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,408
Freshly penned table cards
in a pretty decent chancery

169
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,142
considering I only
had my travel quills.

170
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:54,048
Wait. Why's the
poker game started?

171
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,721
Oh, um, the best man
moved the time.

172
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,950
Mm, no, he didn't.

173
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,445
Yes, he did.

174
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:00,987
Heya, Ted.

175
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,261
Thanks for the sweet lid, bro.

176
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,296
(quietly):
Billy Zabka's
your new best man?

177
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,100
He's the best... around.

178
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,474
Sorry, Ted.
Maybe next wedding.
W...

179
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,674
So you're playing the best man
poker game without me?

180
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,466
Tim Gunn's here and I'm not?

181
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,308
I'm Barney's personal tailor,
of course I'm here.

182
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,483
Plus, I've never
played poker before.

183
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,783
It looks like a hoot.

184
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,015
I moved into a dungeon.

185
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,019
I wrote hundreds of cards.

186
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,521
I even gave your batty
great-aunt Ida a foot massage

187
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:36,464
so vigorous it put her to
sleep right there in the lobby.

188
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,890
Yeah, I don't really have
a great-aunt Ida.

189
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,771
So you are mad about me
and Robin holding hands.

190
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Of course I'm mad, Ted.

191
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,195
Holding hands is, like,

192
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,866
the fourth-grade equivalent
of banging.

193
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,044
Well, in your case, 12th grade.

194
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,042
Self-five.

195
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,143
You broke the Bro Code.

196
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,546
No, I did not. I only went
to help Robin as a friend

197
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,979
because you didn't show up.

198
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,553
I did not break the Bro Code.

199
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,722
It's in the text.

200
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,990
A bro shall not have
a weird moment

201
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,618
with another bro's fiancÃ©e.
Well,

202
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,355
too bad we're in Farhampton
and can't actually check.

203
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,790
I am pleased to announce
that the Bro Code has replaced

204
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,556
the Gideons Bible at select
hotels throughout the country.

205
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,196
Oh.

206
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,401
I'm sorry I said
you hate women.

207
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,873
Yeah, don't be.

208
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,672
For whatever reason,
I just...

209
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,844
(sighs)
I can't seem to connect
with them. Down!

210
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,813
Can you help me?
I've got

211
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,041
a bunch more wedding gifts
in the van.

212
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:32,976
Yay! I love Robin so much!

213
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,153
(quietly):
Oh, God, I'm gonna strangle
that bitch.

214
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,152
Robin, what is it
with you and women?

215
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,315
(groans)
They're so annoying.

216
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,023
I'm glad that you're
my only female friend.

217
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,926
Girls are always
whining and crying

218
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,858
over every little thing.
(groans)

219
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,064
(crying)

220
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,325
Yes. That's exactly...

221
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,003
Thank you. "Oh, oh, boo-hoo.

222
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,544
"Look at me.
I'm a sensitive

223
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,369
little girl..."
Oh. God, I'm sorry.

224
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,874
You're actually crying.
(groans)

225
00:08:58,906 --> 00:08:59,866
It's just

226
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,737
so sad.
(sobs)

227
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,905
I can't be your only girlfriend.
Well, I...

228
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,105
I don't need anybody else.
I got... I got you.

229
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:11,117
For another six days and then
I'm off to Rome for a year.

230
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,891
(gasps)
What are you gonna do without
our Saturday morning brunch

231
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,092
with a side of sassy gossip?

232
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,925
A one-shot power play?!

233
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,100
Hey! Hey, Boston!

234
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,259
Why not drop your hockey pants

235
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,226
and actually take a dump
on the ice next time?!

236
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,936
(cackles)
I love it!

237
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,240
(groans)

238
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,881
See? It is just too horrible
to even think about.

239
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,938
Yeah.
You...

240
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,046
need another female friend.

241
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,048
(sighs)
Whenever I try to talk to women,

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,750
they look like they want
to punch me.
Well,

243
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,753
maybe you're accidentally
giving off the wrong vibe.

244
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:49,056
Like, what do you say
to other women at the gym?

245
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,619
Oh, well, I haven't been
to the gym in forever.

246
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,788
My metabolism is all messed up.

247
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,056
See, I can moose down a pint
of fudge ripple

248
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,895
for a midnight snack
and wake up having lost weight.

249
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,102
(groans)
Well, everywhere

250
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,503
except for my boobs.

251
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,639
So annoying.

252
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,605
You're gonna need a lot of work.

253
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,682
It's in here.
Somewhere.

254
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,651
I... It has to be.

255
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,750
Damn it, I know I should've done
these in alphabrotical order.

256
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:15,752
(groans)

257
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,323
Who cares about the Bro Code?

258
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,320
It's just some stupid book
you made up.

259
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,162
(gasps)
How dare you?

260
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,329
The Bro Code has been around
for centuries.

261
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,088
Nay...

262
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,657
whatever's more
than centuries.

263
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:30,957
Please don't launch
into a fake history lesson.

264
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:34,628
The Bro Code can trace
its lineage all the way back

265
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,938
to Broses himself.

266
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,940
Article one:

267
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,043
bros before ho's.

268
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,106
TED:
Okay.

269
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,114
I see what you're doing.
You can't prove that

270
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,016
I broke the Bro Code, so you're
just making up stories about...

271
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,448
This sacred text
was eventually brought

272
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,993
to the New World
in 1776 by none other

273
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,221
than Christopher Brolumbus.

274
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,726
Article 62:

275
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,899
a bro
who calls dibs first has dibs.

276
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,500
Oh? Dibs!

277
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,802
And that's why he got
to bang Pocahontas.

278
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,166
Pocahontas was
with John Smith.
Maybe

279
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,374
according to the hotel register.

280
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,835
Whatever Mrs. Brolumbus
didn't know

281
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,184
couldn't hurt her, am I right?

282
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,138
Well, except maybe
that New World syphilis.

283
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,147
But I digress.

284
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,978
Barney, if you believe
in the Bro Code,

285
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,824
how come you've broken it
so many times?

286
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,020
(gasps loudly)

287
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,051
How dare you!

288
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,345
I have never broken
the Bro Code!

289
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,857
Hmm? Hmm? Ah.

290
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,560
"Article 104:

291
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:35,261
the mom of a bro
is always off limits."

292
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,525
Okay, look,
we've all had a lot of fun

293
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,525
joking about me
banging your mom.

294
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,037
Not all of us. Continue.

295
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,569
But I swear nothing ever
happened between the two of us.

296
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,365
Trust me.

297
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,877
And what's going on
with your fingers?

298
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,009
(whispering):
That's how our bodies
were intertwined.

299
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,947
All right, this
is ridiculous!

300
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,453
It's ridiculous
that you won't admit

301
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,094
holding Robin's hand was weird.

302
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,389
It wasn't weird!

303
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,890
Yes, it was.

304
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,716
You know what?

305
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:09,058
We need a third
impartial bro to settle this.

306
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,626
To resolve this,

307
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,373
I really need to parse

308
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,599
the text of the Bro Code.

309
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,803
It's too bad

310
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,035
Marshall doesn't have a copy.

311
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,109
Actually, I do.

312
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,868
They were in the, uh,
seat back pockets on my flight

313
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,408
in place of the safety cards.

314
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,912
I'm also pleased to announce
The Bro Code is now available

315
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,445
in select airlines
across the country.

316
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,949
And Lufthansa.

317
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:31,381
Der Bro Code is,
like, huge in Germany.

318
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,288
Okay, so prove to me

319
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,720
you can make a female friend.

320
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,585
What about her?

321
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,134
Ugh! The girl
with the bangs?

322
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,400
Any chick who does that
to her hair

323
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,159
is going through
a big life transition

324
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,097
I don't want to hear about.

325
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,903
Next time, grow your bangs
long enough to cover your mouth.

326
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,096
Ha-pass.

327
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,397
Okay, well...

328
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,938
what about her?

329
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,143
Ugh! Comfortable shoes?

330
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,335
(laughing)

331
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,346
What, are you filibustering
later?

332
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,178
It's after 5:00.
Put on some heels.

333
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,453
Ha-pass.

334
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,481
Okay, well,
what about...?
Ugh!

335
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,787
I haven't even pointed
to anyone yet!

336
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,360
MARSHALL:
Now,

337
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:12,088
although not expressly stated
in the Bro Code,

338
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,955
a weird moment between

339
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,834
a bro and his bro's fiancÃ©e is,

340
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,974
in my bropinion... a violation.

341
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,770
No!
Yes!
However,

342
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,001
Ted was helping Robin
as a friend.

343
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,167
Therefore,

344
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,165
holding her hand

345
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,976
isn't necessarily
a weird moment.

346
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,379
No!
Yes!

347
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,540
That being said...

348
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,708
What?
(mutters)

349
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,145
...if we decide

350
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,551
that holding any friend's hand
is weird,

351
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,453
then, yes,
Ted did break the Bro Code.

352
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,686
So, the question
is this.

353
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,360
If Ted had gone to the park

354
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,359
and held Barney's hand,

355
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,431
would it have been weird?

356
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,734
No?
Yes?

357
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,037
See?

358
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,869
(scoffs)

359
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,765
It's not weird at all.

360
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,339
I don't know what to say.

361
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,536
Just be yourself.

362
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,847
Say something nice.

363
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,549
Which one? I can't do both.

364
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,049
Slut alert.

365
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,587
That's my 14-year-old daughter.

366
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,988
Crappy mom alert.

367
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,157
Ugh!

368
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,534
It's you. Nice bangs.

369
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,701
What is wrong with you?!

370
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,943
I can't do this, okay?

371
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,199
I was raised as a boy.

372
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,867
I don't get along with women.

373
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,605
Can we just drop it?

374
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,010
Okay, I never thought
I'd take a page

375
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,683
out of your fiancÃ©'s
playbook, but...

376
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,451
it's time to target
the crying chick.

377
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,217
Not weird at all.

378
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,064
BARNEY:
Marshall,

379
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,459
why are we
doing this?!

380
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,960
Two dudes on a beach
with a lifeless blob

381
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,593
they're pretending
is alive?

382
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,957
It's stupid.

383
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,026
So, I guess that means

384
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,304
Weekend at Bernie's
is stupid, too.

385
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,132
(gasps)

386
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,267
E-Lawyered.

387
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,071
Now, before

388
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,473
I can render a decision,

389
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,944
we need to recreate
the variables

390
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,313
at the carousel
as closely as possible.

391
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,481
Since Ted says
that he was comforting Robin,

392
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,811
he needs to do

393
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,815
the same for Barney,
so, Ted, comfort Barney.

394
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,619
I don't see how that...

395
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,491
Comfort... Barney.

396
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,490
(sputters)

397
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,132
Barney, what is
going on with you?

398
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,429
Why are you
so upset with me?

399
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,101
Marshall, this is stupid!
I don't...

400
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,971
Accept the comfort.

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,270
Fine!

402
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,572
(sighs)

403
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,673
I guess... I'm not
really mad at you.

404
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,806
I'm mad at myself.
I should have met Robin

405
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,811
at the carousel when she called,

406
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,953
but I was having such a good
time greasing 12-year-olds.

407
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,950
Laser tag.

408
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,021
Helpful. Continue.

409
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,624
Look, Ted, I'm sorry that
I've been taking it out on you.

410
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,094
You were just being
a good friend to Robin.

411
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,334
It's okay.

412
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,929
It would be different if
you still had feelings for her,

413
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,901
but you don't, right?

414
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,165
Right?

415
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,202
(thunder booming)

416
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,711
Okay, now it's weird.

417
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,178
You still have
feelings for Robin?!

418
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,647
What?! What?! What?! What?!

419
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,157
Okay, yes, sometimes I do.

420
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,719
Well, then, turn 'em off!

421
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,687
I would love to,
but it doesn't work that way!

422
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,695
I'm a... I'm a human being.
I-I-I don't have an off switch.

423
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,728
I'm shutting off.

424
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,572
There, there.

425
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,571
Sister?

426
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,843
Who needs a lady hug?

427
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,843
Ugh! What the hell
are you doing?!

428
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,175
Wait. Did you just
"ugh" my hug?

429
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,311
I don't need a hug.

430
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,545
I'm pissed off because

431
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,080
the Rangers just lost
to the Boston Bruins.

432
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,186
BOTH:
I hate the Boston Bruins!

433
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,192
(laughs)

434
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,992
Look, Barney,
I hate these feelings.

435
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,933
I hate myself
for having these feelings.

436
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,828
No one wishes they would go away
more than I do,

437
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,071
but I just... I... I can't seem
to make that happen. I've tried.

438
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,669
Well, then, try harder!

439
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,770
I'm marrying her
in less than two days!

440
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,972
What the hell are we gonna do
about this?!

441
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,443
NARRATOR:
As she watched Robin make
a new friend, Lily was happy...

442
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,676
for two seconds.

443
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,383
Oh, no!
Oh, come on, ref!

444
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,375
I haven't seen that much
hooking go unpunished

445
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,947
since my last
trip to Vegas.

446
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,024
And I was on that trip,
because we are best friends now.

447
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:35,964
(laughs)

448
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,088
(both laughing)
Hey,

449
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,085
this might sound
a little nutty, but

450
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,457
how about
we inject a sexual edge

451
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,055
into our abiding friendship
that...

452
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:47,467
BOTH:
...in no way jeopardizes
our emotional connection,

453
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,300
or respective marriages?!

454
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,536
(both giggling)

455
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,770
LILY:
Aw!

456
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,644
Hell, no!

457
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,642
Excuse me.

458
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,644
I've got a Boston Brewin',
if you know what I mean.

459
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,247
(laughs)

460
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,649
You listen, and you listen good.

461
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,581
If I see your face
around Robin again,

462
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,446
you will be crying
about a lot more

463
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,445
than your precious
New York Rogers.

464
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,117
Rangers?
I will cut you!

465
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:12,986
(Lily mutters gibberish)

466
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,657
Forgot my purse.

467
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,896
(mutters)

468
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,131
You know what?

469
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,967
That's why I only need you.

470
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,941
'Cause you're a psycho.

471
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,110
My psycho.

472
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,679
I am, aren't I?
Mm-hmm.

473
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,106
(giggling)

474
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,275
There's the blushing bride!

475
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,153
Back off, Patrice!

476
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:41,089
Look, Barney, the truth is,
it was weird at the carousel.

477
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,620
On some level,
it's probably been weird

478
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,485
between me and Robin
ever since we broke up.

479
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:45,664
But you're my brother.

480
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:46,862
I would never do anything

481
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,093
to hurt you, ever.

482
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,927
(scoffs)
I mean it, I swear!

483
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,032
I'll-I'll even swear it
on the Bro Code.

484
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,304
The Bro Code's stupid.

485
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,173
(gasps)
How dare you!

486
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,873
I'd be honored.

487
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:06,512
I can't promise that I'll ever
get to a place where it won't be

488
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,846
at least a little weird
between me and Robin.

489
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,321
But I don't want to lose you
as a friend, either of you.

490
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,556
So I will do everything I can

491
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,158
to move on and live with it.

492
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:22,401
The question is... can you?

493
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,965
(sighs)

494
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,399
I'm sorry, Ted.
I just... can't do this.

495
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,967
I fold.

496
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,435
What about the best man?

497
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:41,747
I fold, too.

498
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,481
I fold.

499
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,816
There goes my belly buster.

500
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,051
You sandbag all night,

501
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,585
only to bluff a couple
of rags, pre-flop,

502
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,191
and wind up
with a dry board.

503
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,563
That's what you get

504
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:55,031
for limping in shorts-tacked
with a pack of donkeys.

505
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,961
Muck city.

506
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,426
I fold!

507
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,697
Yeah...
Oh, right.
I knew that.

508
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,244
I knew that, I knew that,
I knew that.

509
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,300
Okay, two
players left.

510
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,854
You are bluffing, robot man.

511
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,379
I raise.

512
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,184
BARNEY:
Oh.

513
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,045
Hey, Billy, do you mind

514
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:21,624
pushing my chips
into the center of the pot?

515
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,894
Preferably with gusto,
because...

516
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,034
I'm all in!

517
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,229
Oh!
Oh, boy!

518
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,102
All right,
all right.
ALL:
Oh!

519
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,925
(cheering and laughing)

520
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,597
NARRATOR:
And that's how I became
Barney's best man again.

521
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:41,067
Everything was back
to going off without a hitch.

522
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:45,947
I'm coming for you, Mosby.

523
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,978
NARRATOR:
Okay, there was one
slight hitch.
