1
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:05,367
*

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,511
You're my best friend, Barney.

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,742
Good. Then, as your best friend,

4
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:11,377
I suggest we play a game
I like to call

5
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,812
Have You Met Ted?

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,046
What? Oh, my God.

7
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,652
I'm so stupid.

8
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,823
Stay there. I'm on my way.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,250
* Say, man

10
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,346
* Don't walk ahead
of that woman *

11
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,488
* Like she don't belong to you

12
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,393
* Just 'cause her
got them little skinny legs *

13
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,996
* You know that ain't
no way to do *

14
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,758
* You didn't act like that
when you had it home *

15
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,228
* Behind closed doors

16
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,337
* All right

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,609
* Now you act like
you're ashamed at a woman *

18
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,739
* Don't even want
nobody to know she's yours *

19
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,035
* But that's all right

20
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:45,507
* You just walk on, baby

21
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,676
* And don't you worry about
a doggone thing at all *

22
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,387
Excuse me. Pardon me.

23
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:54,189
* Because there's some man
somewhere who'll take you *

24
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,292
* Baby, skinny legs and all

25
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,064
I am so, so sorry.

26
00:00:58,092 --> 00:00:59,962
I went to the one
on the West Side.

27
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:03,063
I was beginning to think
that you'd forgotten about me.
(laughs)

28
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,753
NARRATOR:
Kids, the night your Aunt Lily
and Uncle Marshall got engaged,

29
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,379
the night I met Aunt Robin,
was the night of your mom's

30
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,475
21st birthday.
Happy birthday.

31
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,987
W-Where's Max?
He couldn't get a cab.

32
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,159
Which is code for
"waited until the last minute

33
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,659
to get me a birthday gift."

34
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,620
Although...

35
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:31,988
he always nails it.

36
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,985
Two years ago,
he got me an exact replica

37
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,597
of the Pee-wee's
Big Adventure bike.

38
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,329
And last year, he got me
a one-man band suit

39
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:40,296
including knee cymbals.

40
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,074
And these are things you want?

41
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,902
No, these are things I need.

42
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,107
(phone rings)
Oh, that's Max.

43
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,439
Uh... I got to take this.

44
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,544
Okay.

45
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:52,478
Okay, you're officially
super late now...

46
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,421
Yes, this is she.

47
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,563
*

48
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,151
*

49
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,888
WOMAN:
Okay, this is ridiculous.

50
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,197
You've been sitting
around for two years.

51
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,900
It's time to get
back out there.

52
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,501
I have not been sitting around.
I have been hard at work.

53
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,374
I think I'm about to enter my

54
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,472
"Robots Doing Track
and Field Events" period.

55
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,635
It's a very exciting time.

56
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,643
(door closes)

57
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,584
Sweetie.

58
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,909
I love you.

59
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,754
And I can't imagine
what it was like

60
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,249
going through what
you went through.

61
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,221
But these are your 20s.

62
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,980
It's St. Patrick's Day.

63
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,247
The holiday of my people.

64
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:07,416
You're not Irish.
Binge drinkers.

65
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:08,715
Now, let's go.

66
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,256
No, please don't
make me go out there.

67
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,361
It's gonna rain.

68
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,362
Bring your umbrella.

69
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,425
(sighs)

70
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,273
(dance music plays)

71
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:20,568
How is the bathroom line
this long and yet the floor

72
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,341
is covered with urine?
If there's urine out here,

73
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,270
what in God's name
is going on in there?

74
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,435
Screw this, we're holding it.
Let's go dance.

75
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:27,584
No, thanks.

76
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,678
This is what
I'm talking about.

77
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,050
The love of your life
could be on that dance floor,

78
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,179
waiting for you
to bump into him.

79
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,724
If you're not there, he's just
gonna bump into someone else.

80
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,950
Somehow I doubt it.

81
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,516
Oh, I'm sorry.

82
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,964
No, that's okay.

83
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,389
I'm going in.

84
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,194
Wait, is that...

85
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,355
Mitch.

86
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,934
No way.
Hi.

87
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,602
What are you doing
in New York?

88
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:51,731
I live here.
What?

89
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,095
Uh, this is my
friend, Kelly.

90
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,573
Hey.
Hi.

91
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,142
Mitch was my instructor
at orchestra camp.

92
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,369
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
KELLY:
Orchestra camp.

93
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,605
It's not as lame
as it sounds.

94
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,209
We also did physics, so...
Right.

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,740
So, Mitch, what are you
up to these days?

96
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,106
I'm still teaching orchestra.

97
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,754
I'm at this public school
up in the Bronx.

98
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,209
It's totally underfunded,

99
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,377
a lot of the kids
can't afford instruments,

100
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,216
but I really...
Take my cello.

101
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,390
What?
Yeah.

102
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,619
Oh, yeah, you
gotta take it.

103
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,753
I haven't played
it in years.

104
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:14,757
It's just sitting
in my closet.

105
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:15,718
Give it to
one of the kids!

106
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,056
Wow, are you sure?

107
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,060
Do you want to come
and get it right now?

108
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,561
Um... okay.

109
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,463
Okay, great. Let's go.
(laughing)

110
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,896
Okay, yes, you're doing
something nice.

111
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,443
But you're still
bailing on me.

112
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,568
So I guess, karmically...
it evens out?

113
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,244
I'm just worried
about you.

114
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,512
Don't be.

115
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,511
Have fun.

116
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,912
And who knows?

117
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,183
Maybe you'll bump
into someone tonight.

118
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,011
Oh...

119
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,277
(exhales)

120
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:45,986
Girl, I will
sham-rock your world.

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,760
(laughing):
Okay...

122
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,130
I'll...

123
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,289
We'll...

124
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,457
Okay.

125
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,496
THE MOTHER:
Okay, here it is.

126
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,431
I haven't played this

127
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,797
since the popular girls
locked me inside the case.

128
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,805
Although it was roomier
than when I played the violin...

129
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,308
(gasps)
What are you doing?!

130
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,710
I don't know.

131
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,941
What am I doing?

132
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:09,976
I don't know!
What are you doing?!

133
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,180
This is my thing...

134
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,451
It most certainly
is your thing.

135
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,380
Now, please cover your thing up.

136
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,724
Sorry.

137
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:15,678
I-I meant...

138
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,346
this move.

139
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:18,545
It's my thing.

140
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,450
I call it "The Naked Man."

141
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,518
A few weeks ago,

142
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,355
I was on a date,
and it worked.

143
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,491
And then I was on another date
and it worked again,

144
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,126
so I figured it would work
all the time.

145
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,660
Well, now you know
it doesn't work all the time.

146
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,396
Yeah.

147
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,501
Although two out of three...

148
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,643
Is this what it's gonna be like?

149
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,238
Being single in New York?

150
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,870
Even the nice guys turn out
to be total creeps?

151
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:43,707
I have gotten pretty creepy
since I moved here.

152
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,854
I feel so lost right now.

153
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,920
I don't even know
what I'm doing with my life.

154
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,749
Can I tell you
an embarrassing story?

155
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,015
Is it this one?

156
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,353
Taking place right now?

157
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,258
I felt lost

158
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,259
for a long time, too.

159
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,927
I was living in
my parents' basement.

160
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,496
Playing video games, mastur...

161
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,232
ing those games,

162
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,366
until

163
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,741
I finally woke up

164
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,669
and realized I wanted
to follow my dream

165
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,205
of teaching music.

166
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,935
Let me save you a few years.

167
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,707
Even if it sounds
completely crazy...

168
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,947
what is it you want
to do with your life?

169
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:25,522
I want to end poverty.

170
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:26,923
Great.

171
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,464
Then every decision you make
from here on out

172
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,830
should be in service of that.

173
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,930
Wow.

174
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,701
Thanks.

175
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,099
You know,
for a minute there,

176
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,470
I totally forgot
you were naked.

177
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,729
(laughs)

178
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,467
In a way...

179
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,272
aren't we all naked?

180
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,573
Yeah, but your balls
are on my couch.

181
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,307
Hug?
I will take a rain check.

182
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,612
It's raining now.
(gasps)

183
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,814
Oh, my umbrella!
Oh! Uh...

184
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,084
I will be
right back.

185
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,275
Um...
long story.

186
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,946
(door closes)

187
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,715
Nothing happened,
I swear.

188
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,353
Then why are you naked?

189
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,490
Oh, what the hell?

190
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,633
THE MOTHER:
When I got to the club,
it had already closed.

191
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,232
By the next day,
some super inconsiderate

192
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,103
person had taken my umbrella.

193
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,942
But by that point,
I didn't care.

194
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,968
I knew that if I really wanted
to end poverty,

195
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,074
I had to get a degree
in economics.

196
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,807
So...

197
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,082
to answer your question,

198
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,680
that's how I got here.

199
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:27,412
I meant, how did you get here
from the subway station?

200
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,447
Oh.
But I'm only asking
'cause I just moved to town.

201
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,754
I don't even have
a place to live yet.

202
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,316
Yeah, you do.

203
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,424
Come live with me.

204
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,785
My roommate just moved out.

205
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,034
Are you sure?

206
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,028
You just met me.

207
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,489
I could be a serial killer.

208
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,458
I like to believe in people.

209
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:46,166
Plus, what are the chances
that we're both serial killers?

210
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,199
(laughs)

211
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,504
Just promise me there won't be

212
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:49,936
any naked men
in the living room.

213
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,370
Not a problem.

214
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,544
I'm on permanent hiatus
in the love department.

215
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,535
Really?

216
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:56,806
I find that hard to believe.

217
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,214
I guess I'm
old-fashioned.

218
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:01,305
I believe that each of us
only gets one.

219
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,148
And I got mine already.

220
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,454
Well, if you ask me,

221
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,555
you know what comes
after the one?

222
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,558
The next one.

223
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,989
(laughing):
Oh, yeah.

224
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,993
Well, I don't really
see that happening

225
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,385
any time soon.

226
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,697
Hi.

227
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,029
Is this room seven?

228
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,472
And so, if you must bring food
to this class,

229
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,476
please bring enough
for everyone.

230
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,408
I don't want to see someone

231
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,653
eating, say, lobster,
in the front row

232
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,980
without sharing
with the rest of us.

233
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,415
Because that...

234
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,489
would be shellfish.

235
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,689
(laughs)

236
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,757
Come on,
that was funny.

237
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,763
Anyway... (clears throat)
...this is Architecture 101.

238
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,225
Architecture 101?

239
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,202
Oh, no, I'm in the wrong class!
I have to go!

240
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,766
Oh, sorry.

241
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:55,842
Um...

242
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,239
Oh, God.

243
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,910
Wait, I was in the right class.

244
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,209
First day as a professor,
wrong classroom, coming through!

245
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,608
TED:
You play bass?

246
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,347
Seriously,
ask my friends.

247
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,351
I always say

248
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,622
my ideal woman...

249
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,618
...does not play bass,

250
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,763
because this is clearly
your roommate's.

251
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:15,888
She's in a band.

252
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,393
Damn, that's cool.

253
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,964
This is unbelievable.

254
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,632
You just picked out
the only three things in here

255
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,201
that are my roommate's.

256
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,959
So does your roommate's band
ever play shows or...

257
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,827
Get out.
All right.

258
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,418
Okay, this is crazy.

259
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,987
Do you know where this
umbrella came from?

260
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,425
Because I could've
sworn that I...

261
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,801
What's wrong?

262
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,929
Are you okay?

263
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,304
We broke up.

264
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,931
Oh... well,
I never liked him,

265
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,498
and I never thought
he deserved you, and...

266
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,636
I am sorry, I didn't know
you were dating someone.

267
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:06,813
Who was this?

268
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,080
He was the architecture
professor.

269
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,779
The one who taught
Econ 305 by accident.

270
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,282
Oh.

271
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,613
That guy?

272
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,118
Why did you break up?

273
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,689
He's got a thing for you.

274
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:18,988
What?

275
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,119
Yeah, what?

276
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,453
He's... what?

277
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,818
How... um, how could
he have a thing for me?

278
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,127
He's never even met me.

279
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,628
He didn't have to.

280
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,760
Everything he saw of yours,
he went crazy for.

281
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,926
You should've brought
him to my room.

282
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,774
Okay? He would've
run screaming

283
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,370
once he saw my
calligraphy set,

284
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,801
my coin collection,

285
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,506
my chain-mail corset
from the Renaissance Faire.

286
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,468
Well, that's pretty cool.

287
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,677
Come on.

288
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,279
How could he not
be in love with you?

289
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,280
The way you
fall asleep on the couch

290
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,482
when you're doing the crossword.

291
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,123
When did he see me
fall asleep on...

292
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,478
The way your hair smells.

293
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,216
The way your eyes sparkle.

294
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,129
I might have some stuff
to figure out.

295
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,730
You might.
I'm so sorry!

296
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,733
No, uh, it's okay.

297
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,195
It was nice.

298
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,544
I haven't been kissed
in a really long time.

299
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,469
Not long after that,
she met a nice girl

300
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,235
and they fell in love,

301
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,244
so it's a happy ending--
for Cindy anyway.

302
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,807
I, however, am left
without a roommate,

303
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,017
so here we are.

304
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,349
(chuckles)

305
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,653
I have a confession.

306
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,924
Uh, I don't need
a place to live.

307
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,264
I saw your ad for the
roommate, and I just...

308
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,019
I-I really wanted to meet you.

309
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:35,158
I-I'm a huge fan of your
band SuperFreakonomics.

310
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,725
Oh, my gosh, really?

311
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,534
Really, I come
to all your shows,

312
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,895
and I'm not just saying this--
I think you guys are

313
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:44,504
the best economic-themed band
in the entire city.

314
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,667
Even better
than Radiohedge Fund?

315
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,006
Oh, absolutely.

316
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,311
I wish I had the guts
to do what you do.

317
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:55,952
I love to sing, but...

318
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,753
You know what?

319
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:01,285
Next time we do a show, you have
got to come up onstage with us

320
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,361
and sing a song.

321
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,219
Oh, no, I couldn't.
Mm-hmm.

322
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:07,127
No, I'm, I'm, I'm too shy.

323
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,398
* But maybe just one song!

324
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:17,136
I mean, I don't like to think
of SuperFreakonomics as my band.

325
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,140
I think of it as my canvas

326
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,742
upon which I paint
my masterpieces.

327
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,235
(laughs)

328
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,876
And that right there is
why I don't play bass.

329
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,823
(laughter)

330
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,419
Can I help you
with that?

331
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:35,291
Uh, wow, thanks, Superman.

332
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,162
No problem.

333
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,430
It's either help you

334
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,828
or stop a train
from going off a cliff,

335
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,260
and you're much cuter.

336
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,464
(chuckles)

337
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,425
Can I buy you a drink?

338
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,003
Oh, no, sorry, I'm 16.

339
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,797
Oh, wow, sorry.

340
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:50,997
Have a good night.

341
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,438
Wait, you believe that?

342
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,310
I like you.

343
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,781
Uh, sure,
you can buy me a drink.

344
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,350
MacLaren's.

345
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,608
The last time I was here,

346
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,146
I thought this place
was called Puzzles.

347
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,481
That's an odd name.

348
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,415
Why would you call a bar
Puzzles?

349
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,191
Unless that's the puzzle.

350
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,420
Well, um,

351
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,955
thank you for the drink.

352
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,691
Uh, so, do you want
to get dinner sometime?

353
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,896
Um...

354
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,200
Louis, you're really nice,
but...

355
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,373
I was in love with somebody
a long time ago,

356
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,213
and he died.

357
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,668
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

358
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:30,176
Uh, it's silly, but...

359
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,280
it's like the first lottery
ticket I ever bought was...

360
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,324
kaboom, jackpot, and I'm pretty
sure I'm not going to win again,

361
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,851
not like that anyway,

362
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:43,957
so I don't generally buy
lottery tickets anymore.

363
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,131
I understand.

364
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,188
So I should... go.

365
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,497
Well, if you
change your mind...

366
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,201
...give me a call.

367
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,673
Okay.

368
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,905
Okay, now we're even!

369
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,675
What?!
What?!

370
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,183
So we got dinner.
And?

371
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,523
He's... nice.

372
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,362
Nice? He sounds amazing!

373
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,218
Handsome, good dresser,
paid for dinner.

374
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,557
What more do you want?

375
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,561
Do you know how rough
it is out there?

376
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,903
I once met a guy claiming
to be a genie

377
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,530
whose penis grants wishes.

378
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,634
Oh, my God,
who would even fall for that?

379
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,338
The point is,
Louis sounds great.

380
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,940
NARRATOR:
And that's how your mom
started dating Louis.

381
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,683
And for a little while there,
it was fine.

382
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,548
THE MOTHER:
* One tasty English muffin

383
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,108
* Baby, that is what I am

384
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,248
* Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da

385
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,092
* One tasty English muffin

386
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:49,718
* With some raspberry jam.

387
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,586
That's funny.
(chuckles)

388
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,889
NARRATOR:
It just wasn't love.

389
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,228
But then fate intervened.

390
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,534
Anyway, you guys wouldn't, uh,
happen to know of any

391
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,066
good wedding bands available
at the last minute, would you?

392
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:07,106
Hi. One ticket
to Farhampton, please.

393
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,710
NARRATOR:
Now, Louis had a beach house
out in Farhampton,

394
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,442
so he let your mother
stay there.

395
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,278
The day before the wedding,
as she was taking

396
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,423
some cookies out of the oven,
she got an e-mail.

397
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:18,388
(gasps)
What the damn hell?!

398
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,118
"Bass player wanted,"
that is what the ad said.

399
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,964
Can you believe that?

400
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,060
After I'm the one who invited
Darren into the band.

401
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,564
What am I gonna do?

402
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,965
You need to steal
this douche monkey's van.

403
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,440
Then run my husband over
with it.

404
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,438
Well, that's very tempting.

405
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,770
I've never really been
the type of person to...

406
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,136
"Must be hotter
than the girl we have now,

407
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,875
who, in my opinion,
is a six at best"?

408
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,215
Aw, geez, what is this
knucklehead doing?

409
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,092
Excuse me! Hey!

410
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,785
You guys need a lift?

411
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,426
DARREN:
The best man just punched me

412
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,961
in the face for no reason.

413
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,196
You know what? I quit.

414
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,571
You can have
your stupid band back.

415
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,468
Linus, whoever that best man is,

416
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:14,213
I would like to buy him
a double of your finest scotch.

417
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,851
Louis!

418
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,064
Will you marry me?

419
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,670
Can you give me a minute?
Um... okay.

420
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,514
There's someone
that I need to talk to.

421
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,838
I'll-I'll be right back.

422
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,249
(breathes heavily)

423
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:05,431
Hi, Max. It's me.

424
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,228
Sorry to interrupt.

425
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,200
I know you're probably up there
playing baseball with your dad.

426
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,370
Um, look, I-I've got
a situation here.

427
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:19,942
I think that I have been
holding myself back

428
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,182
from falling in love again.

429
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:28,050
(voice breaks):
And I think it's because
I can't let you go.

430
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,021
But you're not here anymore...

431
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,790
so I have to ask this:

432
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:40,462
Would it be okay
if I moved on?

433
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,725
I realize that you have no way
of answering that,

434
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,065
but, um...

435
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,940
Oh, okay... (laughs)

436
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:52,538
I will take that as yes.

437
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,642
Um, in that case,
I should get back in there.

438
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:07,393
(voice breaks):
I guess this is it.

439
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,290
For real this time.

440
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,961
Bye, Max. (sniffles)

441
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,631
(sighs, sniffles)

442
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,639
So?

443
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,159
My answer is...

444
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,859
no.

445
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,703
(sighs)

446
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,474
(sobs)

447
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,971
DESK CLERK:
You're in luck.

448
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,836
Mother of the bride
never checked in.

449
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,705
How many keys
will you be needing?

450
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,683
Just one.

451
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,111
Yeah.
I just...

452
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,815
I broke up with someone.

453
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,515
I think room number six
is the room for you.

454
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,916
Thank you.

455
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,050
(plays soft chord)

456
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,603
(plays soft ballad)

457
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:20,192
* Hold me close
and hold me fast *

458
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,059
* This magic spell you cast

459
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:27,259
* This is la vie en rose

460
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:31,634
* When you kiss me,
Heaven sighs *

461
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,774
* And though I close my eyes

462
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:39,311
* I see la vie en rose

463
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,439
* When you press me
to your heart *

464
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,806
* I'm in a world apart

465
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:50,075
* A world where roses bloom

466
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:55,786
* And when you speak,
angels sing from above *

467
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,732
* Everyday words

468
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:04,298
* Seem to turn into love songs

469
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,838
* Give your heart and soul
to me *

470
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,609
* And life will always be

471
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:19,681
* La vie en rose.

472
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,452
(plays ending chord)

473
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,793
NARRATOR:
Kids, I must have heard
your mom's rendition

474
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,821
of "La Vie en Rose"
a million times over the years.

475
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:35,128
Every night when she tucked
you in, for instance.

476
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,001
But that performance,

477
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,599
that first night
I ever heard her sing,

478
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,842
that one will always be
my favorite.

479
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,640
Wow.

480
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:53,306
Barney, I was just out there
on the patio...

481
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:55,676
and there's someone
in the room next to us.

482
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,175
I didn't see her, but...

483
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,516
Well, she was playing
the ukulele...
