1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,473
TED:
Look at this,

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,465
your wedding weekend.
I know.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,677
This close to finally
having sex again.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,239
It's been forever.

5
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:11,678
Oh, you and Robin
been abstaining?

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:12,982
Talking about you, Ted.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,923
Now here's the deal:
every hookup

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,588
at a weekend wedding is decided
at Friday night drinks.

9
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,388
Get stuck with
the wrong girl

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,590
tonight, the only action you'll
be getting all weekend

11
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,362
is a self-five,
and I don't mean the cool kind.

12
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:27,032
(chuckles)
Self-five! That's the cool kind.

13
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,401
Well, that's a big decision.

14
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,359
The biggest.

15
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:33,598
It brings to mind
that religious text

16
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,704
which we hold most sacred:

17
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,236
Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade.

18
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:42,013
Remember?
They entered a chamber.

19
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,612
Really? I'm the one working
with the Nazis?

20
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,015
Ted, just... just... okay?

21
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,248
Yeah.
They had to choose

22
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,524
which cup was
this special cup.

23
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,123
I forget what
it was called,

24
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,015
but it's like the
Holy Grail of cups.

25
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,626
It was the Holy Grail.
Of cups, exactly.

26
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,959
So the Nazi confederate
chose, and...

27
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,265
(quietly):
Please don't make me do that...

28
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,628
Ted, Ted, the confederate
Nazi chose, and...?
I...

29
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,297
Okay, okay.

30
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:09,996
Oh.

31
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,305
And so, now, I'm gonna explode.

32
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,278
He chose...

33
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:20,683
poorly.

34
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,746
Then Indy picked
a cup, and...

35
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,556
You chose...

36
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,031
wisely.

37
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,028
(playing surf guitar)

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,329
So choose wisely, Ted.

39
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:43,438
To help you decide,
I spent all day yesterday

40
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,671
picking your top
three prospects.

41
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,065
And I helped.

42
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,576
It was either that
or writing our vows.

43
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,078
Uch! Gag.

44
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,349
Sophia was Robin's
college roommate,

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,350
and she's apparently "a bit
of a screamer" in the sack.

46
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,783
Yeah, during sex,

47
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,017
she sounds exactly like
a car alarm from the '90s.

48
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:04,122
You know, whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo,
ooh-uh, ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah.

49
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,628
Dudes love it.

50
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,699
Cassie is the daughter
of my mom's best friend.

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,129
Sad story: 12 years ago,
her gymnast career

52
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:16,236
was tragically cut short
when her boobs got too big.

53
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,711
Grace is a new coworker.

54
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,539
She's had six different
positions at the firm,

55
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,605
and that was just at
the Christmas party.

56
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,214
Ooh.

57
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,706
So, Grace doesn't
arrive till later,
Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,377
I recommend
(whistles) Sophia.

59
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:34,217
I strongly feel that you
should strongly feel her.

60
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,215
I guess it's decided, then.

61
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,057
Ted, right?
Yeah.

62
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,631
I'm Cassie.

63
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,730
Oh... something tells me

64
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:45,272
that we are gonna have a lot
of fun this weekend. (chuckles)

65
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,395
(quietly):
Cassie. I pick Cassie.

66
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,410
You chose...

67
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,412
poorly.

68
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,592
Hey, there's our minister.

69
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,796
Oh, what a sweet-looking old...

70
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,869
Ah! He looks scary.

71
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,328
Looks can be
deceiving, Lily.

72
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,597
But not in this case.

73
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,144
He's a mean old tool.

74
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,674
Oh, he can't be that bad.

75
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,807
I'll get him to come around.

76
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,781
Hi, Reverend.

77
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,422
I'm Lily Aldrin,
the maid of honor.

78
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,118
Not too much honor.

79
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,319
You're dressed like a whore.

80
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,620
(mouthing)

81
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,791
So what's going on?
Why aren't you telling your wife

82
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,356
you got an offer to be a judge?

83
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,695
Lily had her heart set
on us moving to Rome,

84
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,600
so I have to tell her in person.

85
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,772
That way, I know that I can
convince her

86
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,471
that we need to stay.

87
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,773
In the courtroom,
they call me The Convincer.

88
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,706
They really call you that?

89
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,781
I convinced them
to call me that.

90
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,481
But you have to prepare
for your court cases.

91
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,783
Did you prepare
for talking to Lily?

92
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,215
I don't need to prepare, okay?

93
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,719
I can craft a nice...

94
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,352
thingy.

95
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,462
Oh, wow I'm totally...

96
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,790
the twisty metal thingy?

97
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:18,725
You're screwed.

98
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,389
I'm screwed!

99
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,828
(both laughing)

100
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,902
I'm sorry, Ted, I don't know.

101
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,171
I'm just so tired
of this routine:

102
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,899
we flirt, we have a few drinks,

103
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,335
and then we end the night
with meaningless sex.

104
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,471
Oh...

105
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,606
yeah.

106
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,242
Me, too.

107
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,506
Do you want to start the night
with meaningless sex

108
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:39,806
and then flirt later?

109
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,177
You are a visionary.

110
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,624
(laughs)

111
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,620
Come on.

112
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,621
(phone rings)

113
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,852
Oh! Oh! It's work.

114
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,917
Should I get it or ignore it?

115
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,816
Or get it? Oh, or ignore it?

116
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,188
Um...
Or get it?

117
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,525
You know? Go ahead, get it.

118
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,861
Okay. (clears throat)

119
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,455
Hello?

120
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,371
You chose...

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,630
poorly.

122
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,838
I'm fired?

123
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,810
But teaching there
was my dream job!

124
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,768
And you guys
are my only friends.

125
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,837
You all hate me?

126
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,307
Can I at least say
good-bye to all my kids?

127
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:15,716
My kids all hate me?!

128
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,319
(sobbing)

129
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,451
Oh!

130
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:21,216
Oh... It's okay.

131
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,894
So, what were we
about to do?

132
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,326
I think it was
"meaningless" something?

133
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,562
Meaningless socks? No.

134
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:30,697
(sobbing)

135
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,531
No, it wasn't
meaningless socks.

136
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,566
Hey, hi, hi, hi.

137
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,472
Um, so, a little problem.

138
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:40,544
I was trying really hard
not to offend your minister...

139
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:44,414
So how did you
and your husband meet?

140
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:47,415
Oh, it was our first week
of college.

141
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,748
I needed help hooking up
my stereo,

142
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:53,423
so I walked down the hall,
and I just knew

143
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,824
I should knock
on this one door.

144
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,815
Marshall opened it.

145
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,257
It was destiny.

146
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,261
Hi.
Hi.

147
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,863
We've been together ever since.

148
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,467
Excuse me!

149
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,370
What did I do wrong?

150
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,569
What did you do wrong?

151
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,365
We really wanted him
to marry us.

152
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,608
His church has cute
coming out the wazoo,

153
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,714
but when we met with him...

154
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,576
No pets in my church.

155
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,054
No casual attire in my church.

156
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,293
No gum.
No sports logos...

157
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,019
Reverend?
More like Never-end.

158
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,615
Prayer-five.
No shouting.
No cell phones.

159
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:31,858
I'll warn you

160
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,962
that I turn down
most wedding requests.

161
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,625
Particularly from boozy,
promiscuous Manhattanites

162
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,296
who only want me
to marry them because

163
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,474
my church has "cute"
coming out the wazoo.

164
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:48,736
That is the total
opposite of us.

165
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,306
People are like that?

166
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,884
Well, then,
how did you two meet?

167
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,623
Oh, um, um...

168
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,879
Um...

169
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,417
Uh, we've been...
dating since college.

170
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,963
We met the
very first week.

171
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,659
I needed help
hooking up my stereo,

172
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,902
so I walked down the hall,
and I just knew

173
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,928
that I should knock
on this one door.

174
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,833
BARNEY:
I opened the door.

175
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,425
And it was destiny.

176
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:16,943
Hi.

177
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,670
Hi.

178
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,906
BOTH:
We've been together ever since!

179
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,341
You stole our story
of how we met?!

180
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,776
We had to!
Your story is so sweet!
Mm.

181
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,653
You didn't even kiss
till the third date.

182
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,521
By our third date,
I'd hit more bases

183
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,090
than Bob Hope
on a USO tour.
Topical.

184
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,519
Now Reverend Lowell
knows that we lied to him.

185
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,785
What if he cancels
our wedding?

186
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,534
What? That's ridiculous.

187
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,789
Barney, Robin,
I need to speak

188
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,727
with you in private immediately.

189
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,673
And it's not just
losing my job,

190
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,868
my car just got stolen
with all my stuff in it.

191
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,841
And now I think
I'm getting the flu!

192
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,670
I'm sorry.

193
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,805
I've been talking
for, like, a half an hour.

194
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,941
It's fine.
40 minutes. It's fine.

195
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,806
Still, I think I would be able
to handle all of this

196
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,546
(voice breaks):
if my boyfriend Wesley

197
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,821
hadn't just broken up with me!

198
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,991
(sobs softly)

199
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,758
(inhales deeply)

200
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,826
Why don't you tell me about it?

201
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,732
Okay. I should go back
to the beginning.

202
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,495
Oh, no, before the beginning.

203
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,733
Winter, 1998...

204
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,468
Man, this girl is a drag!

205
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,572
If I hurry, I bet I still have
a shot with Sophia.

206
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,977
Okay, I'll get one more drink
with Cassie, then bail.

207
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,639
But where, bar or dining room?

208
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,848
Bar or dining room?

209
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,050
For my fourth date with
Wesley, we went to...

210
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:38,192
Cassie, let's get one more drink
in the dining room.

211
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,048
You chose...

212
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,189
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!

213
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,433
Hey! We just ordered
appetizers.

214
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,558
Sit down, you two!

215
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,798
...Ha-poorly!

216
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,544
Marshall, you're walking into
the biggest fight of your life.

217
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,010
You have to be prepared.
You have to be tough.

218
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,669
I am tough!
No, you're not.

219
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,008
You make some good points.

220
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,882
Now, what exactly
are you gonna say to Lily

221
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:04,911
when you walk
through that door?

222
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,605
Okay.

223
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,777
Hey, baby.

224
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,445
So, listen,
I got this phone call...

225
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,782
DAPHNE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

226
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,218
You haven't seen her in a week.

227
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,452
Where's the "I missed you.
How about a kiss?"

228
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,117
Nothing about her new hairstyle?

229
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,756
Hairstyle?
I can't actually...

230
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,831
Start over!

231
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,132
Lily! Hi.

232
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,561
Mmm.

233
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,626
I missed you.

234
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,934
And your hairstyle so much.

235
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,636
DAPHNE'S VOICE:
I missed you, too.

236
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,638
I can't wait to show you
how much in bed tonight.

237
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:31,911
Okay, that's creepy.

238
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:32,969
Don't break character.

239
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,636
Okay, um...

240
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,135
So, listen, I got this
phone call last week, and I...

241
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,807
DAPHNE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

242
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,706
Acknowledge her own views
on the matter first.

243
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,018
Start over.

244
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,220
Lily, hi, mwah.

245
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,821
I missed you
and your hairstyle so much.

246
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,253
DAPHNE'S VOICE:
I missed you, too.

247
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,087
Okay, so, I know
that you're excited for Rome.

248
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,993
I'm more excited
for bed tonight.

249
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,663
While I was away,
uh, I got a phone call.

250
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,227
To be a judge.

251
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,565
What the damn hell?!

252
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,829
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

253
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,838
Lily does not say
"What the damn hell."

254
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,270
Well, I've never met her
but, yes, she does.

255
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,014
You make some good points.
Wow.

256
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,879
You are terrible at this.

257
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,182
(sighs)
Why did we lie?

258
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,810
We have to come clean.

259
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,505
Frankly,
I am appalled.

260
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,847
I know. I...
Your friend

261
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,293
Lily just tried to pass off
your sweet story

262
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,989
of how you met as her own.

263
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,086
That lying little tart!
I am horrified
and relieved!

264
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:30,026
Does Lily have any... problems
that you're aware of?

265
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,303
Drinking.
Drugs.

266
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,701
BOTH:
She's been drinking drugs.

267
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:35,865
LOWELL:
Well,

268
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,843
I talked to Barney
and Robin,

269
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,871
and, let me say, I'm shocked.

270
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,267
You should be.

271
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,108
Flat-out lying to me like that?

272
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,853
We are not misunderstanding
each other.
How dare you

273
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,849
pretend their beautiful story
is actually your own.

274
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,622
Come again for Lil' Fudge?
(chuckles)

275
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,890
I understand the temptation.

276
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,849
They're such a sweet couple.

277
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,287
I mean, the way
they call each other

278
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,862
Barnmallow and Robinpad.

279
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,131
(chuckles)
Oh.

280
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,800
LILY:
Yes.

281
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,199
I do steal
their stories.

282
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,901
Mm-hmm.
But only because

283
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,173
my husband and I

284
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,300
are so ashamed
of how we met.

285
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,237
See, we only met
because his friend Ted

286
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,743
fell in love with me.

287
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,305
And who could blame him?

288
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,683
Hey, Marshall.

289
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:18,811
See that girl?

290
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,146
Oh, yeah.

291
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,020
You just know
she likes it dirty.

292
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,249
Go say hi.
What?

293
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,593
I can't just go say hi.
I-I need a plan.

294
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,248
Hmm.
I'm gonna wait until
she goes to the bathroom...

295
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,257
Hi.

296
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,658
Have you met Ted?

297
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,660
MARSHALL:
I'm sorry,

298
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,691
I can't...

299
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,157
LILY:
And now, after years of lying,

300
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,355
cheating and backsliding,

301
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,766
here we are, married!

302
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,598
But what can I say?

303
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,072
My husband's a sociopath

304
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,771
who's slept with over
a hundred women,

305
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:46,043
and I'm a slut who once let
my boss feel me up.

306
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,273
Oh, come on!

307
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,037
I felt him up!
It is over
250 women!

308
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,276
If you two want to get married
in my church,

309
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,351
you'll stop breaking
the ninth commandment.

310
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,180
Uh...
no fat chicks?

311
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,675
Thou shalt not lie!

312
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,916
With fat chicks?

313
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,252
You're killing me.
You're killing me.

314
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,618
Now that...

315
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,055
was a good dessert.
(Cassie sighs)

316
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,791
"Dessert" sounds like "desert."

317
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:10,197
The desert
has sand...

318
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,230
there's sand
at the beach...

319
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,265
and Wesley and I

320
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,401
once drove by a beach.

321
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,396
(sobbing)

322
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,307
Excuse me.

323
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,409
(sobbing)

324
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,211
TED:
Now's my chance to leave.

325
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,813
No, I'll wait five more seconds

326
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,205
so I don't seem too eager.

327
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,206
Four...

328
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,247
three... two...

329
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,082
Well, thanks for keeping
our daughter company.

330
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,648
Man, she can be
a real drag, huh?

331
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,855
We're gonna go have
a little fun. See ya!

332
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,294
(laughing)

333
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,125
You're on fire tonight, bro.

334
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,402
But, Lily, being a judge
is my dream job.

335
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,001
DAPHNE'S VOICE:
So your dream job

336
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,673
is more important
than my dream job?

337
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,670
Exactly.
Now you're getting it.

338
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,002
(clicks tongue)
Nope.

339
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:52,008
Start over.

340
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,409
So your dream job's

341
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,240
more important
than my dream job?

342
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,005
But, baby, you already have
the best job in the world:

343
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,405
Mom.
Nope.

344
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,846
Start over.

345
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,021
So your dream job's
more important

346
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,679
than my dream job?

347
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,686
Hey, I gave up peeing
in the shower for you.

348
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,749
Nope.

349
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,787
Start over.

350
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,022
So your dream job's

351
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,927
more important
than my dream job?

352
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,989
Of course not.

353
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,186
But this isn't

354
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,997
just about our future.

355
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,459
It's about everyone's.

356
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,867
As a lawyer,

357
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,199
I couldn't stop big oil
from polluting,

358
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,803
but as a judge...

359
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,995
well, maybe I can.

360
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,736
And that's why I took the job.

361
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,708
You've just been "convincered."

362
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,009
Wait.

363
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,881
You already took the job?

364
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,710
Without even talking
to your wife?

365
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,284
Start over.

366
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,813
Start over... start over.

367
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,748
What the damn hell?!

368
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,818
Hi, Reverend
Lowell?

369
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,823
Whew!
Made it through my half.

370
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,285
You're up.

371
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,393
Oh. Uh...

372
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,834
The-the truth is,
we-we have

373
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,500
a complicated,
messy history

374
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,198
that-that we're
not too proud of.

375
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,330
But...

376
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,904
we're sorry
that we lied,

377
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:56,403
and hope that
you can forgive us.

378
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,336
Nope, I can't do it.

379
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,384
You're going to have
to find a new officiant.

380
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,740
Okay.

381
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,847
Well, these
things happen.

382
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,909
And a new church.

383
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,117
What the damn hell?!

384
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,190
TED:
This evening could not
get any worse.

385
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,120
Whenever
you're ready.
Crap!

386
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,334
Hey, Ted.

387
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,088
Thanks for
being so great.

388
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,097
I'm lucky to have you
around this weekend.

389
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,099
Ooh, yeah...

390
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,501
About that...

391
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,402
I should really go see
about the, uh...

392
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,335
So, sex?
My room is very close.

393
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,110
(Cassie laughs)

394
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,339
TED:
Sophia. Hi.

395
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,773
Oh, God. Wesley.

396
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,007
Wait. Wait, you're Wesley?

397
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,514
Hey, Cassie.
(laughs nervously)

398
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,875
Your parents were just saying
you have a new boyfriend.

399
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,084
"Boyfriend" is
a little premature.

400
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,376
Though I did
pay for dinner.

401
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,947
Ted and I are
very happy.

402
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,287
Are we?

403
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,391
(crying):
Even if...

404
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,462
he'll never replace you.

405
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,991
(sobbing)

406
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,303
So, Sophia. Hi.

407
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,270
I'm Ted.

408
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,128
Robin's friend.

409
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,897
What do you say we give
these two old flames

410
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,895
a chance to...
catch up alone,

411
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,367
and maybe you and I
could go get a drink.

412
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,905
Are you
hitting on me?
Dude!

413
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,180
Ted, let's go!

414
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,413
You tip...

415
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,182
...poorly.

416
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,123
Look, I know. I shouldn't
have taken the job

417
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,327
without telling Lily.

418
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,988
Why are you so ticked off
about it?

419
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,127
Because I know
what she's going through.

420
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,402
I always dreamed

421
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,600
of having a career
I could be proud of,

422
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,902
but my husband never
supported me.

423
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,004
Eventually,

424
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,836
I had to... make a choice.

425
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,911
Now, every day,

426
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,309
I'm out there,

427
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,181
I'm fighting for the good guys,
and I love it.

428
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,410
Doesn't

429
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,014
your wife deserve that, too?

430
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:50,146
Wow. Um, maybe
you're right.

431
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,453
I didn't realize how many
sacrifices you'd made.

432
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,161
What is it you do, anyway?

433
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,029
I'm a lobbyist
for a big oil company.

434
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,488
What the damn hell?!

435
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,164
You know
that I'm an environmentalist!

436
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,026
That's why you don't want me
to become a judge.

437
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,525
But you're the reason
I have to become a judge!

438
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,936
You're the devil incarnate!
And outcarnate!

439
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,068
Every kind of carnate!

440
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,872
Please, is-is there

441
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,106
any way you'd reconsider?

442
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,642
No! No, no!

443
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,976
You two are both
terrible people.

444
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,882
Who found each other
in this crazy world!

445
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,354
Aw!

446
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,993
And who lie
about how they found each
other.

447
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,119
So, please leave now. Just...

448
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,215
Ugh! Ugh!

449
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,457
You know what?
You're right.

450
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,992
We shouldn't have lied
about our story.

451
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,055
I love our story.

452
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,067
Sure, it's messy,
but it's the story

453
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,329
that got us here,
about to get married.

454
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,568
I love it, too.

455
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,573
Every messy chapter.

456
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,205
I love that you slept
with over 250 women

457
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,241
before deciding that
I was your favorite.

458
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,407
This is killing me.

459
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,084
And I love
that we just had

460
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,553
to keep having sex
with each other,

461
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,221
even when we were dating
other people.

462
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,519
This is really killing me.

463
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,250
And I love that your
marriage proposal

464
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,386
involved a strip
club, lying to me,

465
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:05,261
and pretending to bang the
woman I hate for two months.

466
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,592
I love that we keep
a running tally

467
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,426
of all the different rooms
we've had sex in.

468
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,561
I love that two weeks ago, we
put this room on that list.

469
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,528
Huh? Come on, Rev.

470
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,696
That's got to be worth
some kind of reaction, right?

471
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,105
I mean, right where
your hymnal is, is where we...

472
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,208
we...

473
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,282
(laughs)

474
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,621
Well, that's not what you want.

475
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,727
(crying and kissing)

476
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,960
(crying, sniffling,
kissing)

477
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,725
Um, are...
are you okay?

478
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:48,144
I think... think maybe seeing
your ex was a bit much for you.

479
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,398
No. Not at all.

480
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,407
I want... only you.

481
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,139
Oh, yeah.

482
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:57,284
I want to...
I want to rock your world.

483
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,550
And you're so hot.
(sniffling)

484
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,279
I want to ride you
like a bronco.

485
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,546
(sobbing)
Okay, Cassie. Cassie.

486
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,615
Yeah, we...
we can't do this.

487
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,064
I mean, you're crying.

488
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,288
(coughing)

489
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,563
And contagious.

490
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,991
You're-you're having

491
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,325
a really, really bad week.

492
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,331
I think... I think
you should just

493
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,003
take it easy.

494
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,101
You're right.

495
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,473
I'm not in a
good place.
No.

496
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:23,602
Oh, wow.

497
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,566
I probably would have
let you do

498
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,335
all sorts of crazy things to me.

499
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,535
(sighs)

500
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,451
Exactly.

501
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
I release you.

502
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,675
Go have fun this weekend.

503
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,447
Meet someone else.

504
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,316
TED:
Yes! Yes! Be cool.
Okay.

505
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,264
NARRATOR:
But I couldn't
meet someone else.

506
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,260
Hey, Ted?
Yeah.

507
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,632
Everyone here is saying

508
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,629
you and Cassie are the
couple of the weekend.

509
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,101
How great is that?

510
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,029
NARRATOR:
Barney was right.

511
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,704
I'd chosen poorly,
everyone had seen us together,

512
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,804
and now the whole weekend
seemed lost.

513
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,336
Until...

514
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,672
Hi. I just got here.

515
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,608
Did I miss anything?

516
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,553
Not at all. Grace, right?

517
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,719
I'm Ted. Let's get you a drink
before you talk to anyone else

518
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,079
or hear anything.

519
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,116
Hey, guys.
How's your night going?

520
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,364
Ugh!
Ugh!

521
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,229
Our minister just died.

522
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,128
We can still
use the church,

523
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,059
but we only have two days
to find a new officiant.

524
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,234
Unless...

525
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,533
BARNEY:
Wedding at Bernie's!

526
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,534
We're not doing
Wedding at Bernie's!

527
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,396
Wow. Oh, that's terrible.

528
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,396
Should I make a toast
in his honor?

529
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,068
(mouthing):
No... no, no, no...

530
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,435
Of course I should.

531
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,742
Everyone?

532
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,406
To Reverend Lowell.

533
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,375
He may have
passed away

534
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,753
tonight, but
he will always...

535
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,781
Uncle Robert died?!

536
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,317
Oh, no.

537
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,593
(crying)

538
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,531
(high-pitched crying)

539
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,690
(sobbing)

540
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,657
Have a nice weekend.

541
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,526
NARRATOR:
All that night, I did nothing
but choose poorly.

542
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,396
But thanks to Cassie,

543
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,444
I didn't get together
with anyone at that wedding.

544
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,270
And if I had,

545
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,775
well, then, your mother
and I might never have met.

546
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:12,678
So, maybe, in a way,
I chose wisely.

547
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,752
SOPHIA:
Boo-uh! Boo-uh! Eee!

548
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,621
Although, it sure as heck

549
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,349
didn't feel like it
at the time.

550
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,585
Aah! Aah! Aah!

551
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,289
(sighs)

552
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,191
She chose...

553
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,462
Wesley.

554
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,791
(chuckling)

555
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,895
I've been dying
to say that one all night.

556
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,298
SOPHIA:
Boo-uh!

557
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,300
Look, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

558
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,802
The truth is, you're right.

559
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,443
It was wrong of me to take
that job without telling Lily.

560
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,469
I don't need to be tough
with her. I need to be fair.

561
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,136
Thanks, Marshall.

562
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,313
I should also apologize.

563
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,453
While you were filling the tank,

564
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,148
I may have been so angry,

565
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,320
I texted your wife with the news

566
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,821
that you took that judge offer.

567
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,663
(phone ringing)

568
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,818
Don't forget
to compliment her hair.
