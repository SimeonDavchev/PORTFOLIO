1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,210
(cork pops)
Whoa, sorry, sorry.

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:05,468
Oh, my God! You know that
there is gonna be champagne

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,336
at this party, right?
I know, I know.

4
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:08,905
But we're gonna get
there and it's gonna be

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,212
everyone congratulating
you on your book,

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,245
saying, "This is a revelation!

7
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:15,351
"You're gonna end
poverty in our time.

8
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:16,823
"This is the greatest book
anyone's ever written

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,190
in any genre."

10
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,889
You're the only one
that says that, sweetie.

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,990
Well, it's true.

12
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,491
So before I lose you

13
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,163
to your adoring public,

14
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,092
I just want to take
a moment, you and I,

15
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:29,627
to celebrate the best
year of our lives.

16
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:31,698
Happy New Year.

17
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,272
Happy New Year.

18
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,044
(grunts)

19
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:40,572
We go big tonight!

20
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,208
Easy there, buddy.

21
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,013
We're old people, remember?

22
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,914
We haven't even gone
medium sized in forever.

23
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:49,376
And I cannot carry
you home in this dress.

24
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,517
Sweetie, relax.

25
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,721
I got this.

26
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,192
Yeah, right.

27
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:55,361
I can see your whole future.

28
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,129
You are gonna be
so hungover tomorrow.

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,529
I'm gonna be fine.
Hmm.

30
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,600
I made a vow, remember?

31
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:02,759
NARRATOR:
Kids...

32
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:03,756
the story behind that vow

33
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,897
took place the morning

34
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,572
of Barney and Robin's wedding.

35
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,540
You see, after drinking
way too much the night before,

36
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,440
this is
all your Uncle Barney remembers

37
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,912
from the first two hours
of his wedding day.

38
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,211
(gasps)

39
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,414
(roars)

40
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:21,718
And that's it.

41
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,049
Now here's how the rest of us

42
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,453
remember those two hours.

43
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:25,645
(tape rewinding)

44
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:26,846
ROBIN:
Found him.

45
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,432
You know, he looks better
than I thought he would.

46
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,959
Rise and shine.

47
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,925
Up and at 'em,
let's do this.

48
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,431
There's a gas leak!

49
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,868
The building's on fire!

50
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,767
Your shoes don't
match your belt!

51
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,437
(moaning)

52
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,122
BOTH: Uh-oh.

53
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,320
(piano playing
Wagner's "Bridal Chorus")

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,170
Okay, I think my fiancÃ©

55
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,602
peed himself a little.

56
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,836
Oh, tomorrow
I'm gonna be able to say

57
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,271
my husband
peed himself a little.

58
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,678
(moaning)
Don't worry.

59
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,009
I accidentally spilled
some iced tea on him.

60
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,213
Oh, thank God.

61
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:25,205
(whispering):
I didn't really spill

62
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:26,506
some iced tea on him.

63
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,177
Oh, God, this is bad.

64
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,776
We're doing
family wedding pictures

65
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,047
at the lighthouse
in two hours.

66
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,685
My father is paying
for the whole thing.

67
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,221
He's gonna kill Barney
if he doesn't show up.

68
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,986
Come on, your dad's tough.

69
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,134
But won't he understand a
good old-fashioned hangover?

70
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,389
ROBIN:
My father's recipe

71
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:41,398
for a Bloody Mary

72
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:42,559
trades out tomato juice

73
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,796
for wolf's blood.

74
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,371
Ooh.
Ooh.

75
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,499
Bloody Mary?

76
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,504
Sounds more like
a Bloody Scary.

77
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,538
I'm gonna say it again.

78
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,672
Uh, hold on.
Bloody Mary?
Sounds more...

79
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,836
You guys are forgetting

80
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,584
Barney Stinson has
a super power.

81
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,578
He can't take a bad photo.

82
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,548
(grunts)
Okay, here.

83
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,123
Watch.

84
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:08,855
Guys, Barney may be dead.

85
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,389
MARSHALL:
That's it!

86
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,334
You know what? We are all
now seriously too old

87
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,660
to keep doing this to ourselves!

88
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,234
I vow here and now

89
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:18,833
that I shall never again
get that drunk in my life!

90
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,366
NARRATOR:
Yeah, he'd wind up
breaking that vow.

91
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,572
And I will not break that vow

92
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,014
as sure as I will always
have a full head of hair!

93
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,509
WOMAN:
In other elections today,

94
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,682
in the race for New York
State Supreme Court,

95
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,081
Judge Brad Morris...

96
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,112
Mmm, just look at him.

97
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,617
I would love to rub that down.

98
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,919
(clears throat)
Sorry.

99
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,750
Has increased his sizable lead

100
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:40,786
over Judge Marshall Eriksen.

101
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,891
It was supposed to
be a victory party.

102
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,863
You ran
a great campaign, baby.

103
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,562
Yeah, but it was
the most stressful

104
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,234
three weeks of my life!

105
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,301
And in other results,
a surprise comeback.

106
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,543
We are now ready to call the New
York State Supreme Court race

107
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,409
for Judge Marshall Eriksen.

108
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,068
(all cheering)

109
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,966
We'll go to Judge Eriksen
for a live statement

110
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,808
in just a few minutes.

111
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,753
(slurring):
Come again for Judge Fudge?

112
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,076
As your next commissioner...

113
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,284
State Supreme Court judge.

114
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:10,877
...of Gotham City...

115
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,088
The State of New York.

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,260
...I vow to make
Batman work harder.

117
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,590
I say

118
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,385
shine that Bat-Signal
even for small stuff.

119
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,958
Like, uh, shoveling snow.

120
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,796
Or, like, uh, if a police horse
dumps out in the park.

121
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:27,804
LILY:
Okay, well, that will be

122
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,265
all at this time, thank you.

123
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,103
That's all.
Okay.

124
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,138
Mmm, good night.

125
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,612
Never again!

126
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,241
I vow it!

127
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,975
I am more worried
about the vows I have to take

128
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,480
with this useless
pile of garbage

129
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,452
in a few hours from now.

130
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,680
What do we do?

131
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,924
You guys see the irony here.

132
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,179
The only person
who could possibly get

133
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,646
Barney back on his feet

134
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,815
is Barney.

135
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,023
NARRATOR:
See, over the years,

136
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,094
we'd all come to experience

137
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,991
something Barney called...

138
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,593
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir!

139
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,826
The most effective

140
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,961
post-bender,
head's-too-tender ender

141
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:55,955
from here to Denver.

142
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,196
What's in it?

143
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,970
Glad you asked.
Ah, I take it back.

144
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,469
Columbia University, 1941...
I take it back, I take it back.

145
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,471
President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt,

146
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,973
whom we all know is most famous
for being a world-class drunk,

147
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,706
commissioned a top secret
scientific project--

148
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,311
develop an elixir to cure
the common hangover.

149
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,784
And what brilliant scientific
mind did boozy old FDR pick

150
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,453
to head up this historic task?
TED: Look.

151
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,453
My head really hurts.
Let's just speed this along.

152
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,715
You're clearly ripping off

153
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,352
the story
of the Manhattan Project,

154
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,888
which was run
by Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

155
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,663
So I'm gonna guess it was
your distant relative...

156
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,058
...Barnert Stinsonheimer?

157
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:33,297
Somebody's read
their history books.

158
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,303
The Too Many Manhattans Project

159
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,635
hit a few snags at first.

160
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,971
The first batch exploded.

161
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,906
Which sounded
kind of like this.

162
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,541
Boom!
Oh!

163
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,636
You suck.

164
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,007
Just let me finish.

165
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,805
But the second batch...

166
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,647
sadly also exploded.

167
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,052
Boom!
Oh!

168
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,753
Why are you here right now?

169
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,145
Do you want to hear
the story or not?

170
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,486
Absolutely not. Please leave.

171
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:55,862
After some trial and error,

172
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,159
Dr. Stinsonheimer finally found

173
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,031
the magic formula.

174
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,703
TED:
Hang on.

175
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,031
Funyuns?

176
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,365
Tantrum Soda?

177
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,330
Sure.

178
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,537
In 1941?

179
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,899
Sure.

180
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:10,937
They haven't made
new Tantrum since then.

181
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,271
That stuff lasts a while.

182
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,175
Anyway, the elixir
was such a success,

183
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,608
he was awarded
the Bro-bel Prize.

184
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,605
True story.

185
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,707
Boom!

186
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,078
Wh-Wh-Why?

187
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,515
That time I was
just messing with you.

188
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,321
Just give me the stupid drink.

189
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,586
(groans)

190
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,821
NARRATOR:
And the craziest part was...

191
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,797
I-I feel better.

192
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,630
Over the years,
each of us would discover

193
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,526
that Barney's
elixir actually worked.

194
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,238
Like, way better.

195
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,369
What's in this thing again?

196
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,143
Stinson family secret.

197
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,372
Oh, come on, you told me most of
the ingredients in your story.

198
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,037
Just tell me the secret one.

199
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,406
Ha! I'll never tell you.

200
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,914
I'll take it with me
to my grave.

201
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:53,946
Damn it, Barney!

202
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,281
Why are you always so selfish?!

203
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,645
We are trying to help you!

204
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:57,754
ROBIN: Okay,
we somehow have

205
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,245
to get this leaky barf bag

206
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,546
back on his feet before
the wedding pictures.

207
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,418
Well, we know what Barney
would want us to do.

208
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,085
WOMAN:
Say cheese.

209
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,596
ALL: Cheese!

210
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,828
ROBIN: No!

211
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,602
We are not doing
Weekend at Barney's!

212
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,831
But that's the dream!

213
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,595
I can't believe
I just said that.

214
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,944
Someone suggest
something useful!

215
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,268
Okay, here's the plan.

216
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,073
Marshall, you and Ted
go gather

217
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,435
the ingredients we do know.

218
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,473
Robin,

219
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:21,908
you wake up Barney long enough

220
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,612
to find out
the secret ingredient.

221
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:27,624
And I'll race down to the spa
to keep my 8:15 mani and pedi.

222
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,618
Okay, let's do this!

223
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,679
Bitch?

224
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:30,817
Walk out that door and I tag in

225
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,091
Zabka as my maid of honor.

226
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,919
Okay, let's start simple.

227
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:35,985
Fresh ocean air.

228
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:36,993
Come on, baby.

229
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,494
BOTH:
Come on, honey.

230
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,186
Come on, love, yeah.
Baby, baby.

231
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,799
I'll get the elevator.

232
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,131
Oh, I should get some water.

233
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,780
Okay, so...

234
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,812
accidentally throwing
Barney down the stairs

235
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,018
did not wake him up.

236
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,290
Nor did banging his
head on each step

237
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,688
as we dragged him back up here.

238
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,460
So, how do we
wake him up long enough

239
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,219
to tell us the final ingredient?

240
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,828
You know, when my sister and I

241
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,560
had trouble getting up
for school,

242
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,755
my dad had a few
cute little tricks.

243
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,798
(growling)

244
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,796
I'll do it!

245
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,967
I swear to God I'll do it!

246
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,906
Your dad used to do this to you?

247
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,841
Well, it was with
a Cabbage Patch doll and an ax.

248
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,077
But same idea. Trust me.

249
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,081
I was never late
for kindergarten again.

250
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,553
What? Come on.

251
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,993
(Barney moaning)

252
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,548
(groans)

253
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:40,887
I second Marshall's vow.

254
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,991
I will never, ever get
that drunk again.

255
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,934
NARRATOR:
Yeah. She would.

256
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,059
LILY:
My baby boy's

257
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,325
in college.

258
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,502
Did you pack enough undies?

259
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,870
Yes, Mom.
(shushes)

260
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,329
Your father did a lot of puking

261
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,337
in these hallowed halls.

262
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,409
From-from binge studying.

263
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,338
(quietly):
Saved it.

264
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,343
That reminds me, mister.

265
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,944
No underage drinking.

266
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,746
No good comes
from hanging out

267
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,748
in bars and getting drunk.

268
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,450
But every story
from your 20s starts in a bar.

269
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,022
Listen to your mother.

270
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,251
Oh, what are we gonna do
without you in the house?

271
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,616
(groans)

272
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,715
We got him out of the house!
Drink up!

273
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,761
(grunts)

274
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,133
(whoops)

275
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,731
Oh...

276
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,803
You son of a bitch!
You son of a me!

277
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,136
All right, we got most
of the ingredients on our list.

278
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,111
Ginger, bananas, Funyuns.

279
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,080
I cannot believe
that minimart sold Tantrum.

280
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,878
It's been discontinued
for years.

281
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,110
Uh, hey.
(clears throat)

282
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,105
Will you, uh,
toss me that bottle?

283
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,877
Oh. Yeah, we haven't
done this forever.

284
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,415
(smacks lips)

285
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,420
Dude!

286
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:45,451
You're a grown man.

287
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,715
Why you throwing a Tantrum?

288
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:47,924
Nice!

289
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,085
So awesome!

290
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,062
So awesome!

291
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,120
Okay, there's only

292
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,788
one more item on the list and...

293
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,956
it's an odd one.

294
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,825
Grease?
Grease.

295
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,434
At the Farhampton Inn,
we don't cook with grease.

296
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,426
Our menu is organic.

297
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,268
Farm to table, locally grown.

298
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,573
No "grease."

299
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,565
Sir,

300
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,236
I am from Minnesota,

301
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,135
where every meal
is cooked with grease.

302
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,747
And my father dubbed
that food the tastiest eats

303
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,650
in the whole
gosh darn world, so...

304
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,123
And how is your father's health?

305
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,089
Point is,
it tastes really good.

306
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,591
Also, uh,

307
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,262
we need it to help a friend
recover from a hangover.

308
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,091
Wait a second.

309
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,796
There's bacon right here.

310
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,098
And where there's bacon,

311
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,259
there's bacon grease.

312
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,667
Which we throw out.

313
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,929
And we aren't making
any more bacon today.

314
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,637
Not unless it all somehow gets
eaten in the ten minutes

315
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,870
before breakfast is over.

316
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,713
No, no, no!

317
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,112
Ted, do not give me that look!

318
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,313
A mountain of food.

319
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,654
A ticking clock? Come on!

320
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,809
You live for this stuff!

321
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,977
No, I'm not a wild animal.

322
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,146
I'm a Columbia-educated lawyer,

323
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,154
poised to become a judge
before age 35.

324
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,557
And remind me,
how did you celebrate

325
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,058
getting accepted into Columbia?

326
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,690
You eat one
eight-pound block of fudge

327
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,897
in 12 minutes
and you're marked for life.

328
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,999
You're not marked for life...

329
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,031
Big Fudge.

330
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,325
I'm out, okay?

331
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,326
You eat the bacon.

332
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,897
You know I can't.

333
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:10,336
I'm allergic.
Ted.

334
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,710
I've been trying
to tell you this for years.

335
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,469
Your bacon allergy is a lie

336
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,706
your mother made up
so you'd eat healthy as a kid.

337
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:18,013
No, I'm just allergic
to a lot of stuff.

338
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,405
Bacon, doughnuts,

339
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,676
Halloween candy.

340
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,815
Not saying thank you.

341
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,491
Oh, my God!

342
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,788
That bitch lied to me!

343
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,557
Okay, I'll-I'll do it.

344
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,289
But I... look, I don't, I don't
even know if I'll like bacon.

345
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,032
(sniffs)

346
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,103
Mm-hmm.

347
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,199
What do you think?

348
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,274
(choir humming)

349
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,813
I have seen the face of God.

350
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,608
Okay, there is one thing
we haven't tried yet.

351
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,514
Making out with each other.

352
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,376
You really think
that will wake him up?

353
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,575
Wake up who now?

354
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,786
(Barney moaning)

355
00:11:58,819 --> 00:11:59,889
(groans)

356
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,550
Look at this soggy bag of snot.

357
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,688
That's it,
I am joining Marshall's vow.

358
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,863
I am never, ever getting
that drunk again.

359
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,804
NARRATOR:
Kids, you see
where this is going.

360
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,096
Did last night really happen?

361
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,365
I think so.

362
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,314
Look, let's just agree.

363
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,809
Absolute silence for
the rest of the day.

364
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,142
(baby crying)

365
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,976
(groans)
(laughs)

366
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,752
Every time.

367
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,880
You want me to get her?

368
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,045
No, I got her.

369
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,653
(grunts)

370
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,215
Yeah, I know, I know.

371
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,415
(shushing)

372
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,733
Hey, Barney?

373
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,601
Yeah?

374
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,429
Whose baby is this?

375
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,138
Uh, pardon.

376
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,077
(speaks French)

377
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,909
How could you, Mom?!

378
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,275
You had the map

379
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,152
to heaven
and you never showed me the way.

380
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,151
May you rot
in the bacon-less hell

381
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,823
that I've lived in
my entire life.

382
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,993
Yeah, they-they, uh,
crisp it up real nice here.

383
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,291
Don't they?
Mm-hmm.

384
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,162
What is that--
applewood smoked?

385
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,360
You know what, Ted,

386
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,631
you've been going
at it real hard.

387
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,159
Why don't you take a breather?

388
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,604
And I'll drive us home.

389
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,358
(growls)

390
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,998
Well, congratulations.

391
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,633
Here's your grease.
(grunts)

392
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,938
No!

393
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,700
I don't want to lose a finger.
(grunts)

394
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,967
Here.
Thanks.

395
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:26,966
All right, Ted, let's go.

396
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,077
No, no!

397
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,209
I finally found
the one, Marshall.

398
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,714
Her name is Bacon.

399
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,946
You know, this would go great on
one of my mom's LT sandwiches.

400
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,324
Buddy, you got to take it easy.

401
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,791
Never!

402
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,789
I got a lifetime without bacon
to make up for.

403
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,491
I will keep eating and eating

404
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,233
and eating...
Oh, God, help me.

405
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,388
I'm going down.

406
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,196
NARRATOR:
And that's the first

407
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,958
and last time I ever ate bacon.

408
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,468
He's not waking up!

409
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,469
I'm out of ideas!

410
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,470
We've tried everything!

411
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,842
Not everything.

412
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,310
Lily Aldrin?

413
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,669
Let's make out.

414
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,007
(gasps)

415
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,482
Are you sure?!

416
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,010
Yeah, baby, I'm sure.

417
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,745
Um...

418
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,649
okay, well, you know what?
I mean...

419
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,151
it probably won't even work.

420
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,754
And it was stupid.

421
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,145
I'm stupid.

422
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,817
(shushing)

423
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,415
You're beautiful.

424
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,329
(gasps)

425
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,273
More, more, more, more,
more, more, more, more.

426
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,268
Whoa, he's awake!

427
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,699
How'd you do it?!

428
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:28,704
Nothing special.

429
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,865
Hydration, patience.

430
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,943
Quick, before he
passes out again.

431
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,211
Barney!
(grunts)

432
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,069
What's the secret ingredient

433
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,907
in Stinson's
Hangover Fixer Elixir?

434
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,284
Come on, stay with us.

435
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,851
The secret ingredient

436
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,080
is...

437
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,515
nothing.

438
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,420
ALL: Huh?

439
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,721
I ate too much bacon.

440
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,063
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir

441
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,229
is a lie.

442
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,929
That's the secret.

443
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,802
You...

444
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,229
You know, I could use
a little lie-down myself.

445
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,705
So, Stinson's Hangover
Fixer Elixir is a lie?

446
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
Why would you lie about that?

447
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,076
Just to mess with us?

448
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,211
Like that one jerk
in every high school

449
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,445
who brings in fake mushrooms

450
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,580
just to see
who's gullible enough

451
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:15,754
to think they're tripping?

452
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,782
Damn you, Ollie Gunderson.

453
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,387
I knew those shrooms
tasted like Sea-Monkeys.

454
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,090
How do you know
what Sea-Monkeys taste like?

455
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,922
My older brothers are not...

456
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,757
the best people.

457
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:26,892
Why did you lie?

458
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,896
I...

459
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,298
love you guys.

460
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,500
He loves us?

461
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,065
Let's throw him down
the stairs again.

462
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,574
Yeah!
Yeah!

463
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,405
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Think about it.

464
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,609
The first time Barney

465
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,610
gave us that drink,

466
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,611
those hangovers all happened

467
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,682
at the worst possible moments.

468
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,851
Remember? Marshall thought
he botched day two

469
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,919
of the bar exam, so he freaked
out that night and got wasted?

470
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,949
Now I'm gonna miss
the last day of the bar?

471
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,515
I'll never be a lawyer!

472
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,663
I should just go back to being
a manager at Structure.

473
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,618
That ten percent
off all vests sale?

474
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,957
That was my idea!

475
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,262
As was cutting the arms off

476
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,363
all the shirts
that weren't selling.

477
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,004
That's where I belong.

478
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,100
No, Marshall.

479
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,702
You're gonna be a lawyer.

480
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,443
(groans)
No, I can't do it.

481
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,268
Yes, you can. Your first day
back live on the air

482
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,674
is gonna be legend--
wait for it--

483
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,766
dary!

484
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,507
Your kindergarten field trip

485
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,513
to the jackhammer and
siren museum today...

486
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:19,475
(groans)

487
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,682
...is gonna be legendary.

488
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,154
No, it's not.

489
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,193
Nothing's ever gonna
be legendary again.

490
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,448
I-I'm never gonna
recover from this.

491
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,857
It's just a hangover, Ted.

492
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,118
Not that!

493
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,487
I got left at the altar, Barney.

494
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:36,195
I'm now a guy
who got left at the altar.

495
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,629
There's no coming back
from that.

496
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,895
Drink this.

497
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,103
You're gonna be okay.

498
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,914
Barney made up the Stinson's
Hangover Fixer Elixir

499
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,209
so we would all believe
that we could rally.

500
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:52,512
I mean, even though it's fake,
it-it worked.

501
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,975
Like-like Dumbo's feather.

502
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,023
Dum-bro's feather.

503
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,049
A placebo.

504
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,654
Place-bro.

505
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,715
A sugar pill.

506
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,222
(gasps)

507
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,694
I...

508
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,822
He lied so we'd be okay.

509
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,227
Hmm.

510
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,559
Barney does love us.

511
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:11,825
I wish we could help him out
the way he helped us.

512
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,934
But the wedding photos
are in 20 minutes.

513
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,896
(groans)
My dad's gonna be so pissed.

514
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,265
Yup.

515
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,444
Barney's a dead man.

516
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:28,315
(camera shutter clicking)

517
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,545
Barney?

518
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,916
You were always a bit...

519
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,394
chatty and blond

520
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,064
for my taste. Like a woman.

521
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,692
But this new side of you--

522
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,928
quiet,

523
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,362
steady?

524
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,297
I like it!

525
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,603
You've earned my
respect today, son.

526
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,896
I request the highest of fives.

527
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,307
Oh, no.
Stay cool.

528
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:55,679
I got this.

529
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,751
BARNEY:
I don't believe this.

530
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,422
You did Weekend at Barney's.

531
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,891
And it worked.

532
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,818
God, today's gonna be
all downhill from here.

533
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,385
That's what the bride
wants to hear.

534
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,723
No, that's not what I meant.

535
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,488
I just mean Weekend at Barney's

536
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,226
is a thousand times more amazing
than our wedding could ever be.

537
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,203
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
I can't wait to see the photos!

538
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,568
Well, he bought it.

539
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,803
We lied out of love.

540
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,107
Look how happy he is.

541
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,639
I mean, he has no idea
we had to cancel

542
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,414
the wedding photos
and my dad was so angry,

543
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,642
he came up to our room
and kicked Barney in the crotch.

544
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,808
And the best part is
your dad has no idea.

545
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,477
He still loves me.

546
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:39,586
Hey, do anyone else's
balls hurt?

547
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,989
MARSHALL:
And, look,

548
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,190
some good came out of all this.

549
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,592
Seeing you like that,
we all vowed

550
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,663
never to get that drunk again.

551
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,192
Well, actually I didn't.

552
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,457
But I will now.

553
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,755
Never again.

554
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,326
Never again.
Never again.
Never... Ow!

555
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,134
NARRATOR: Kids, no matter
how hard we try,

556
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,596
even the best of us go
a little too wild sometimes.

557
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,605
And in those moments,
we all need

558
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,038
someone who loves us
to help us rally.

559
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,013
(groans)

560
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,011
(whispers):
Happy New Year.
Okay.

561
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,446
That was, that was way too loud.

562
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,521
You're practically screaming.

563
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,190
What you need

564
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:15,189
is Stinson's
Hangover Fixer Elixir.

565
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,292
Even if that means lying
once in a while.

566
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,494
Does it work?

567
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,585
Totally works.

568
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,298
(gags)

569
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,030
It's normal,
it's totally normal.

570
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,834
(groans)

571
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,568
(laughs)
I love you so much.

572
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:31,543
I love you, too.

573
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,841
Whoop, whoop.

574
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,143
Better drink it fast.

575
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:35,984
BOTH: Mommy!

576
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,178
Hey, look who it is!

577
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,510
Get her!

578
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,675
(all clamoring)

579
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,393
I can't believe we kissed today.

580
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,490
Weird.

581
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,062
I-I feel kind of bad

582
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,590
that, um,
Ted and Marshall missed it.

583
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,926
Hey, we should kiss
one more time

584
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,432
in front of them just to,
like, blow their minds.

585
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,066
Right?

586
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,340
Nah, I don't think so.

587
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,039
Exactly, totally.

588
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,510
Ha-ha, guys, you don't get
to see this kiss either.

589
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,110
So, where should we go?

590
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,041
Closet, patio?

591
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,277
Ooh, I think the sauna's open.

592
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,752
Well, I... actually...

593
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,280
to be honest,
it-it felt kind of weird to me.

594
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,447
Once was enough.

595
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,585
Totally.

596
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,689
We could kiss.

597
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
We could not kiss.

598
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,224
We could kiss.

599
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,616
Doesn't matter to me.

600
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,757
It's stupid. I'm stupid.
