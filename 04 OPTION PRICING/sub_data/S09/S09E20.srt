00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,913
NARRATOR: It was the day
of Barney and Robin's wedding,

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,308
and a surprise guest
had just arrived.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,710
ROBIN: Mom, I-I can't believe
you're here.

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:09,812
How did you get here?

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,053
On a plane.

6
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:14,179
With your fear of flying?
What, did the plane drive here?

7
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,815
(laughs)
I've made enormous strides

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,920
since you last saw me, dear.

9
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,852
This is nice.
(chuckles)

10
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,888
I don't love flying,
I must admit.

11
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,063
I haven't been on a
plane in years, but...

12
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,993
maybe this won't
be such a bad...

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,997
PILOT: Ladies and gentlemen,
we are cleared for takeoff.

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,829
(screams)
We're all gonna die!

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,765
We're all gonna die!

16
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,071
(screaming)

17
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:37,673
During the flight, I'll admit,

18
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,265
I-I had a few...
difficult moments,

19
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:41,378
but, you know,

20
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,079
by the time we'd landed...

21
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,581
Here already.

22
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:48,952
Well, I have to say,
it wasn't so dreadful after all.

23
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,092
Oh, I do apologize if
I caused any distress.

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,360
And, oh, I'm terribly
sorry about the door.

25
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,929
I had no idea it would
fly off like that.

26
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,859
Please, please
send me a bill,

27
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,064
because I'd like
to replace it.

28
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:06,572
I'll be taking the train home.

29
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,146
Well, it's official:
I'm gonna be

30
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:27,116
Judge Marshall Eriksen.

31
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:28,915
That is great.

32
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,156
Can you help me get
a driver's license?

33
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,962
A what?

34
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,403
Marshall, you, uh,
you don't sound

35
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,828
too excited to
become a judge.

36
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,603
(sighs) I feel
kind of guilty about it.

37
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,171
I mean, I know how badly
Lily wanted to move to Italy.

38
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,601
Don't do this, bro.

39
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,165
Classic mistake.

40
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,674
You won-- enjoy it.

41
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:48,075
Drink the blood of your
vanquished enemy and move on.

42
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,238
You're gonna be
a great husband.

43
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,908
No, no, wait,
he has a point.

44
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,845
I mean, you said yourself,
it was her decision.

45
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,451
Lily chose to
give up her job

46
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,793
and not move to Rome
so you could be a judge.

47
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,148
Yeah, but something
seemed off.

48
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:01,487
We had this big fight
and she stormed out,

49
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,592
and when she came back, she had
totally, like, changed her mind.

50
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,655
Wait, what time
was this?

51
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:08,363
A little after 3:00 a.m.,
Billy Zabka. Why?

52
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:09,696
Well, last night,
I was out

53
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,030
doing some late-night
dirt-biking in the sand.

54
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,804
Naturally. Continue.
And I ended up

55
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,173
at that EZ Pick a few
miles up the road.

56
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:16,343
And, well...

57
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,782
That's odd.

58
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,123
SEVERAL PEOPLE:
Boo...!

59
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,718
You saw Lily
getting into someone's car?

60
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:31,991
I wonder who it was.

61
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,989
What did
the license plate say?

62
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,391
It said...

63
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:37,123
"AHOY!!!"

64
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,627
The Captain!
Lily's boss.

65
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,960
He has a house out here.

66
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,164
Wait, why was Lily getting
into the Captain's car

67
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,727
at 3:00 in the morning?

68
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,725
Guys...

69
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,337
I hate to even say this, but...

70
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,011
do you think it's possible...

71
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,207
...that I could eat
six of these saltines

72
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,814
in under a minute?

73
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,005
Challenge accepted!

74
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,715
Well, I can't wait
to meet this Barney.

75
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:06,091
I haven't met him
already, have I?

76
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,189
Because they said
after getting Tasered,

77
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:11,662
I might suffer from
short-term memory loss.

78
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,162
Oh, you'd remember
if you'd met Barney.

79
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,533
Why don't I see what
he's doing right now?

80
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:17,734
(phone ringing)

81
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,865
Barney's phone.
Ted, where's Barney?

82
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,930
He's trying to eat

83
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,398
six saltines in
under a minute.

84
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,106
Well, his future
mother-in-law is here.

85
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,308
Robin's mom is here.

86
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,105
And she wants to meet him.

87
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:29,982
She wants to meet you.

88
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,053
He's kind of in the middle of a
saltine challenge at the moment.

89
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,717
But as soon as he's done,
he'll just, uh, pop right over.

90
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:40,953
All right. Good-bye.

91
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,558
ROBIN:
The saltine challenge?

92
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,960
Now?
(Lily chuckles)

93
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,561
It's his wedding day.

94
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,063
Guys do weird things
on their wedding day.

95
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,534
Well, on my wedding day,

96
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,632
Robin's father
completely disappeared

97
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,074
for about three hours.

98
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,469
He just said,
"I've got to go

99
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,241
and teach somebody some
manners," and off he went.

100
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,100
And then

101
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,407
three hours later,

102
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,069
he emerged from the
woods with a dead elk

103
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,138
slung across his shoulder.

104
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:07,276
And I didn't even know that
there were elk in Bermuda.

105
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,215
But this Barney--

106
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,818
he sounds like a fine young man.

107
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,121
Yes, he is.

108
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,992
We're going again.

109
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,459
Marshall, are you okay?

110
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,930
Why did she get into
the Captain's car,

111
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,058
and why didn't she
tell me about it?

112
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,932
Well, maybe it was
a work thing.
What? No.

113
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,061
She has a big
fight with me,

114
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,455
she goes down
to an EZ Pick,

115
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,767
she gets into
the Captain's Mercedes,

116
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:25,898
and then three
hours later,

117
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,403
she doesn't want to go
to Italy anymore?

118
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,135
I mean, do you
think this means...

119
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,999
That the Captain moored
his dinghy in Lily's lagoon?

120
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,008
Most definitely.

121
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,469
That's crazy.

122
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,007
You'd never moor a
dinghy in a lagoon.

123
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,082
I don't know, Ted.

124
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,279
In certain
tidal conditions,

125
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,481
if you had a
protected inlet...

126
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,082
Okay, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

127
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,483
Today is
Barney's wedding.

128
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,475
Let's just forget it.

129
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,987
Marshall...

130
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,089
do you want to go over to
the Captain's house right now,

131
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,491
punch him in the face
really fast

132
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,293
and then come back
and do this wedding?

133
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,604
Would that be okay?

134
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,999
Ranjit, get the car.

135
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,830
Getting the car.

136
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,996
Baby, I can't wait
to meet your mom,

137
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,674
but I kind of got to go on

138
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,473
a little excursion
with the boys right now.

139
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,035
What?
Where are you going?

140
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,013
Me and the boys have to go
teach someone some manners.

141
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,653
Are there any elk
on Long Island?

142
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,949
* My gallant
housekeeping crew *

143
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:21,958
* Good morning.

144
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,019
* Sir! Good morning.

145
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,027
* I hope you are quite well.

146
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,459
* Quite well, and you, sir?

147
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,026
* I am in reasonable health.

148
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,733
* And happy to meet you
all once... *

149
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:32,725
(doorbell rings)

150
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,466
Oh, bother it!

151
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,502
I'll get it.

152
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:41,608
Ahoy, Marshall!

153
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,075
(Captain grunts)

154
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,018
Are you okay, Robin?
No, I'm not okay,

155
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,250
because apparently,
I am marrying my dad

156
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,645
in a few hours.

157
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,087
Oh, sweetie, no.

158
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,222
I'm sure that's not true.

159
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,657
I mean, th-there's
so much

160
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,992
you don't know
about your father.

161
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,197
There were... oh, there
were so many other

162
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,029
red flags in our marriage.

163
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,234
I mean, for instance,

164
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,225
do you know that

165
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,096
before he was engaged to me,

166
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,935
he was engaged to marry
an exotic dancer?

167
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,741
Hello!

168
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,013
Red flag!

169
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,281
LILY:
Oh, Genevieve,

170
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,278
not good.

171
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,579
And did you know
that one time,

172
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,112
to impress women,

173
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,547
he dressed up like
a Prussian aristocrat,

174
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,223
had a painting of himself made,

175
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,121
and posed next to it
in an art gallery?

176
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,394
Can you imagine?

177
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,862
Oh, that's a
rough one.

178
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,361
Darling, darling,
the list goes on.

179
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,563
He would always take
his mother's side in arguments.

180
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,897
He never checked with me
before making plans.

181
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,102
And our rehearsal dinner...
oh, boy, did we have it out

182
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,665
right before our
rehearsal dinner!

183
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:48,575
Thank you, Linus.

184
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,080
GENEVIEVE:
For the first

185
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,811
ten years I knew him,

186
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,446
I didn't even know what
your father did for a living.

187
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,653
Every time I used
to ask him,

188
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,154
he'd just say...
Please!

189
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,985
Yes, that's exactly
what he used to say.

190
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,420
How did you know that?

191
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,260
Heck of a jab,
Marshall.

192
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,391
Well-placed.

193
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,385
MARSHALL:
Captain,

194
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,956
I know something happened

195
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,795
between you and Lily last night.

196
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,900
What?

197
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,131
No. Nothing happened.

198
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,425
Captain's honor.

199
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,097
Well, you can ask my fiancÃ©e.

200
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,835
FiancÃ©e?
What-what fiancÃ©e?

201
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,910
Captain.

202
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,568
Permission to clear things up?
Granted.

203
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:20,737
Me.

204
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,014
We're engaged.

205
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,482
It's "boats,
boats, boats"!

206
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,581
Ted, look!
Uh, yeah.

207
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,983
I mean, yeah, I know her
from that commercial.

208
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:28,975
Boats, boats, boats!

209
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,976
And only from
that commercial.

210
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,018
No, you
banged her.

211
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,153
Remember?

212
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,187
Like, a bunch
of times.

213
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,192
You knocked "boots,
boots, boots."

214
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,864
MARSHALL: All right, Captain.
What the hell

215
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,032
happened here
last night?

216
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,960
Well, it was just
after four bells.

217
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,095
(phone ringing)

218
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,000
Ahoy!

219
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,371
(choked up):
Hi, I-I know it's late,

220
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,998
but I've got to get out of here.

221
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,004
CAPTAIN: So I sent the car.
When she got here...

222
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,166
Lily, what a lovely...

223
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,013
Can I use your powder room?

224
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,969
And then she went
to the powder room.

225
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,477
She was in there
quite a while, actually.

226
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,479
Probably a deuce.
Go on.

227
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,681
CAPTAIN:
And when she came out,

228
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,982
she had to leave right away.

229
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,453
It was odd.

230
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,681
But I assure you,
nothing inappropriate happened

231
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,117
between me and your wife.

232
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,022
Captain, I understand
what you're saying,

233
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,194
but what you don't
understand is that

234
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,522
Lily is my wife,

235
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:12,058
and I love her
way too much

236
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,032
to behave rationally
right now!

237
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,190
En garde!

238
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,202
This is the best
day of my life.

239
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,131
Oh, darling,
come on, no, no.

240
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,038
You're not marrying
your father.

241
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,470
I mean,
your father...

242
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,474
I mean, let's just
put it this way.

243
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,406
Your father was
a sociopath.

244
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,011
He slept with
over 20 women.

245
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,014
And sure, you know,

246
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,346
we were friends
for years first

247
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,681
and it was entertaining
watching him lie

248
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,317
to those poor girls
to get inside their snow pants,

249
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,062
but I should have
known back then

250
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,389
this was not
husband material.

251
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,994
I mean, even your
Uncle Jim, you know,

252
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,326
his gay black brother...

253
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,700
Will you shut up!

254
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,328
Go for Barney!

255
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,695
Your bride is freaking
the crap out right now.

256
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,095
Where the hell are you?

257
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,866
I warn you,
Captain,

258
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:02,935
I've pretended to have a duel
with actual swords twice.

259
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,206
I warn you, Marshall,

260
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,114
I was on the Olympic
fencing team.

261
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,946
Won three gold medals.

262
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,621
I warn you, Captain,

263
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,050
I'm starting to feel like
this was a mistake.

264
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,385
I think I'd better
not say where I am.

265
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,961
I am not kidding around here!

266
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,389
Tell me where you are!

267
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,694
(sighs)

268
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,486
We're at the Captain's house.

269
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,002
What is it?
What's wrong?

270
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,237
I am so busted.

271
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,980
Thank you, Linus.

272
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,677
You have another piece of gum?

273
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,963
LILY:
I can keep a secret.

274
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,118
I can keep a secret real good.

275
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,957
Are you chewing gum?

276
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,992
I can keep a secret
like nobody's business,

277
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,597
'cause it is nobody's business.

278
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,000
You never chew gum.

279
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,801
You shouldn't
chew gum in here.

280
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,073
'Cause it's a secret,
and I'm keeping it!

281
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,802
Wait!

282
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:04,967
Stop the duel!

283
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:05,735
Oh, thank God.

284
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:06,973
I mean, why?

285
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,007
TED:
Why?

286
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,781
Because I just solved
the mystery,

287
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,780
that's why.

288
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,111
Mosby Boys!

289
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,982
We agreed you wouldn't
do that anymore.

290
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,585
Mystery? What mystery?

291
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,519
Lily has a secret.

292
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,930
She's hiding something,

293
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,288
and I know what it is.

294
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,706
Okay, what is she hiding?

295
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,709
I'll tell you in a minute.

296
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:44,081
I want to enjoy the suspense
a little bit first.

297
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,045
Ooh.

298
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,163
Oh, my God, will
you just tell us!

299
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,201
Very well.

300
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,630
Now, we can all agree

301
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,974
that this is the first
time I've ever set foot

302
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,670
in this house, correct?

303
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,842
Oh, this is
going to be unbearable.

304
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,841
Now, Captain, your powder room--

305
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,313
does it face out
on the ocean?

306
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,412
Of course, right over the cliff.

307
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:18,584
Just as I suspected.

308
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,981
And if I were to walk

309
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,153
into this powder
room right now,

310
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,382
I believe I'd see a
potted plant of some sort.

311
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,687
Is that correct?

312
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,649
Yes. There's a daisy.

313
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,087
A daisy. Interesting.

314
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,533
Uh, not traditionally
an indoor plant,

315
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,659
but I suppose
it gets plenty of light

316
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,355
with the southern exposure.

317
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,997
That's right, it does.

318
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,432
Will you please fetch the daisy?

319
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,468
Aye-aye.

320
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,265
I totally solved it.

321
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,536
You didn't solve it.

322
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,411
You didn't solve it.

323
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,613
You didn't
solve it.

324
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,014
You didn't solve it.

325
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,016
Did you solve...?
No, you didn't solve it.

326
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,018
I solved it!

327
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,250
Ah.

328
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,045
Thank you, Captain.

329
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,117
Now...

330
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,355
a simple question.

331
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,961
When Lily and Marshall are apart
for an extended period of time,

332
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:11,525
what is the one thing
Lily always does?

333
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,534
Cry?

334
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,795
Masturbate?

335
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:14,704
Karate?

336
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,744
Go sailing?

337
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,739
No.

338
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,041
When Lily and Marshall are apart

339
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,443
for a long period of time,

340
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,946
Lily... always...

341
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,185
...starts smoking again.

342
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,091
That's true, she does.

343
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,097
Happened when she went
to Paris in college.

344
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,969
It happened when she moved
to San Francisco, and last week,

345
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,128
it happened again.

346
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,337
From the moment Marshall left
for Minnesota,

347
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,239
Lily's been secretly
puffing down the ciggies

348
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,241
like a 46-year-old grandma
at a Reno slot machine.

349
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,514
Problem was,
come Friday morning,

350
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,613
she knew she'd have
to quit again, cold turkey.

351
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,576
And it wouldn't be easy.

352
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,454
She tried to make it
a whole car ride

353
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,753
without a fix, but couldn't.

354
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,424
So, she pretended to be annoyed

355
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,423
by perfectly reasonable things,
like my stylish driving gloves

356
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,986
and my appreciation of the
historic van Otterloop manse.

357
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:18,626
All so she could have
one last smoke on the train.

358
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,995
But afterwards,
her breath told the tale.

359
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:24,004
And that's why,
when she got to the hotel,

360
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,007
Lily...

361
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,009
was chewing... gum.

362
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,212
Lily never chews gum.

363
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,143
What? Never?

364
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,208
Well, hardly ever.

365
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,945
Great job, Ted.

366
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,621
That's some pretty
solid evidence. Gum.

367
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,149
(laughing):
Oh, Barney, my dear boy.

368
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,547
I'm just getting started.

369
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:42,988
Getting started?

370
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,163
TED:
Lily knew that cigarette

371
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,661
was probably her last
for a while.

372
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,662
She needed something
to keep her nerves calm,

373
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,234
so she headed to the bar.

374
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,872
Anytime you see me
without a drink in my hand,

375
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,969
you put a drink in my hand.

376
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,001
Are you my guy, Linus?

377
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:00,067
TED: What followed was
a long day and a half for Lily.

378
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,037
A really long day and a half.

379
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,675
Oh, it's kind of insane

380
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,850
how much happened
in just a day and a half.

381
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,679
Anyway, Marshall returned,

382
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:11,084
they had a big fight,
Lily stormed out.

383
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,188
And that's when she realized,

384
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,019
if she was gonna sneak one
this weekend,

385
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,364
this was her chance.

386
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:18,058
And after that fight,
boy, did she need one.

387
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:21,261
Only problem: she was all out.

388
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,664
Now,

389
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,755
it's 3:00 a.m.,

390
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,166
you need a cigarette,

391
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,568
and the only place
that's open is an EZ Pick

392
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,999
that's five miles down the road.

393
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:28,995
You have no car.

394
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,866
What do you do? Go.

395
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:31,844
Dirt-bike it.

396
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,911
I can walk that far.

397
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,870
Masturbate.

398
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:34,867
Take a boat.

399
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,378
What? A boat? No.

400
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,610
Dude, she got a ride
in your car, remember?

401
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,076
(phone ringing)

402
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,254
Ahoy.

403
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,252
Hi. I-I know it's late,

404
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,753
but I've got to get out of here.

405
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,724
I want to make
one stop first.

406
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,418
TED:
The problem was,

407
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,187
Lily didn't want to smoke
in front of her new employer.

408
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,556
So, when she arrived

409
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,464
at the Captain's house,
there was only one

410
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,626
possible course of action.

411
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,104
Can I use your powder room?

412
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,401
TED:
Now,

413
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,236
you're Lily.

414
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,571
You've just had a cigarette

415
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,765
in your boss's powder room.

416
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,436
What do you do
with the cigarette butt?

417
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,135
Throw it out the window?
Flush it?

418
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,637
No, she-she wouldn't do
either of those things.

419
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,978
She's an environmentalist.

420
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,053
Stick it in your purse?

421
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,151
Marshall could find it there.

422
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,382
Throw it in the trash can.

423
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,946
The Captain would
find it there.

424
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,715
Hide it in a boat.

425
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,552
A boat? Wait.
How would that...

426
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,758
I don't know.

427
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,129
I just... I like boats.

428
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,329
No.

429
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,801
There's only one place
that she would put it.

430
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,800
A place where, eventually,

431
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,872
it would decompose and serve
as a natural mulch.

432
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,939
It's in the daisy.

433
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,942
And sure enough,

434
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,084
if I dig around...

435
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,710
I am all but guaranteed
to find...

436
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,121
A pregnancy test.

437
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,052
You could smoke those?

438
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,627
(vomiting)

439
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,574
(panting)

440
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,035
Oh, no.

441
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,600
So, you want
the Kennedy package?

442
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,838
Bingo.

443
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,184
One other little thing.

444
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,350
When you do put a drink
in my hand,

445
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,349
let's make it non-alcoholic.

446
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,681
There's a chance
I might be pregnant.

447
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,976
Okay, Linus,

448
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,818
don't start popping
the sparkling cider just yet.

449
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,064
I'm just being cautious.

450
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,960
I'll take a test
when I get home.

451
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,631
It can wait.

452
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,030
Are Marvin and I
and any other future children

453
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,074
we may have

454
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,168
just some consolation prize?

455
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I have to get out of here.

456
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,571
*

457
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,807
(sighs)
It can't wait.

458
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:54,182
*

459
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:56,848
Lily, what a lovely...

460
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,423
Can I use your powder room?

461
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:03,092
*

462
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,333
Two minutes. Here we go.

463
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,199
*

464
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,738
Guys, we need to go back
to the hotel.

465
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,936
Lily peed on that,
and you touched it.

466
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,475
Lily?

467
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,053
We're gonna have a baby?

468
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,115
I told you guys
I could keep a secret.

469
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,129
Uh, uh, Barney,
this-this is my mom.

470
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,100
Hi.
Hello.

471
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,059
Oh.

472
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,256
Oh, he's a hugger.

473
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,527
Nothing like your dad.

474
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,095
(laughs)

475
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,274
I'm sorry. I-I was
gonna tell you tonight.

476
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,072
No. Oh, my God, no. It's fine.

477
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,914
There's just...
there's so much we have to do.

478
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,439
You know, we have to, um...
we have to do research on...

479
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,275
uh, hospitals in Italy,
and we have to, uh...

480
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,150
We're not going to Italy.

481
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,979
Of course we are.

482
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,081
Lily, we have to do this.

483
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,446
You're gonna live in Rome,

484
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,654
and you're gonna get your dream,
because...

485
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,956
because you're giving me mine.

486
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,459
Again.

487
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,291
But there's gonna be
all sorts of paperwork,

488
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,556
and-and if she's born outside
of the U.S.,

489
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,095
she could never
become president.

490
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,270
It's a girl?

491
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,469
Oh. I don't know, but...

492
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,802
in my mind,
I kind of think she is.

493
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,907
Oh.

494
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,468
I love you so much.

495
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,977
Mmm.

496
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,009
We're gonna give you
some privacy.

497
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,524
It's my room. Why
do I have to...?

498
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,019
Just... come on.

499
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,988
I thought this was
an exit.
No, balcony.

500
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,122
Ah. Oh.

501
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,287
Well, we'll just give them
a few minutes, and then...

502
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,796
Mm-hmm.
...we'll go
back in and...

503
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,128
Oh.

504
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,433
Oh, they are both naked.

505
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,665
Yeah, they work fast.

506
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Yes. (sighs)

507
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,695
Oh, darling.

508
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,707
Oh, you're going
to be fine.

509
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,939
You know, for every marriage
in the world

510
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,984
like I had with your dad,
you know, there's...

511
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,850
there's a marriage
like those two in there.

512
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,979
And, oh, marriage is...

513
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,315
Oh, it's terrifying.

514
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,980
It's-it's like flying.

515
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,188
You know, you're-you're filled
with this mortal dread,

516
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,662
but if you find someone
you feel safe with,

517
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,960
it's like flying!

518
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,003
But if you got someone that you
feel is really there for you,

519
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,071
someone you can depend on,

520
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,539
you're gonna be fine.

521
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:37,539
Do you have someone
like that?

522
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,577
I do.

523
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,956
...Daisy.
