1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,570
THE MOTHER:
Okay, it's over.

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:05,044
TED:
Starting the clock now.

3
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:06,143
(exhales)

4
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:07,244
(exhales)

5
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:09,375
Labor sucks, huh?
Yeah.

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,810
That fun-sounding name?

7
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,514
It's totally misleading.

8
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:13,546
(chuckles)

9
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:14,651
Better have this baby soon.

10
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,522
You know my
mom's rule:

11
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,690
Nothing good happens
after 2:00 a.m.

12
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,019
I don't buy it.

13
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,264
Just like I don't buy
what her son told me:

14
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,920
"Let's go away
for one last weekend

15
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,257
"before the baby comes.

16
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:26,863
We'll be fine!"

17
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,834
Well, I hate
to point fingers,

18
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,932
but you should
never listen to me.

19
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,074
You know that.

20
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,530
That's my bad.

21
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:36,573
Oh!

22
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,044
Here comes
another one.
Already?

23
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:39,442
Yeah, yep, yep.
Okay, okay, okay.

24
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,013
We should get you to
the hospital. Come on.

25
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,381
THE MOTHER:
Okay.

26
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,480
TED:
Oh, here we go.

27
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,917
You guys can't still see where
Marshall slapped me, can you?

28
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,692
Your face looks like
a "don't walk" signal.

29
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:55,922
Your face looks like
a photo negative

30
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,286
of the Hamburger Helper box.

31
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,855
A palm reader could
tell Marshall's future

32
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,732
by studying your face.

33
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,101
The phrase "talk to the hand
'cause the face ain't listening"

34
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,231
doesn't work for you

35
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,125
because the hand
is on your face.

36
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,897
A simple "yes"
would've sufficed.

37
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:10,967
LILY:
Oh, baby,

38
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,614
I missed you so much.

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,210
I am so angry!

40
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,942
I am gonna tear you
apart tonight.

41
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,207
I am gonna
tear you

42
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:19,606
apart tonight!
Okay, okay.

43
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,277
Look, we said
that we wouldn't fight

44
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,975
until the gang was all done
hanging out, remember?

45
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,217
NARRATOR:
Ever since Lily
heard that Marshall

46
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,924
had accepted an offer
to be a judge,

47
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,315
thus jeopardizing
their planned year in Italy,

48
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,228
they both knew
a big fight was coming.

49
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,460
But when they finally
saw each other...

50
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,295
Pause?

51
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,070
Pause.

52
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,098
NARRATOR:
See, Lily and Marshall
had a long tradition

53
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,144
of hitting "pause"
on their arguments.

54
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,070
Sometimes they paused because

55
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,144
they suddenly had
other things to do.

56
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,314
We have to stick
to our budget! Okay?

57
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,282
You cannot be out there
buying all these

58
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:53,811
Brazilian bikini waxes
and Kama Sutra body oils

59
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,517
and edible...
Pause.

60
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,921
NARRATOR:
Sometimes, they paused
to keep their fights

61
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,452
from subtly changing subjects.

62
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:01,918
Baby, I cannot
put up with

63
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,115
your shoes being
all over the house!

64
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,188
Why not? I put up with
your terrible mother.

65
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,157
(gasps)

66
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,655
Pause!
Pause.

67
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,196
NARRATOR:
And now that they were paused,

68
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,131
Marshall realized
he would do anything

69
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,296
to stay paused
for as long as he could.

70
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,995
Okay, time
to go to bed.

71
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,266
Big day tomorrow.

72
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:18,365
Big day tomorrow!
Big day tomorrow!

73
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:19,206
MARSHALL:
Screw tomorrow!

74
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,440
We go big tonight, huh?

75
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,214
We go big tonight!
We go big tonight!

76
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,814
(laughing)
MARSHALL:
I mean, uh...

77
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,045
come on, you know, uh,

78
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,319
what time
is it, anyway?

79
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,898
Hey, where's
the baby?

80
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,239
The elevator!
The elevator!

81
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,541
(laughs)

82
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,012
Ah, that joke just
never gets old.

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,310
And it's not at all inspired
by real-life events.

84
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,143
No, it is not.
Mm-mm.

85
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,307
Anyway, the sitter has
Marvin for the night.

86
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:00,407
Ooh!

87
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:02,578
And now...
the best thing

88
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,316
to come out of my
cross-country trip:

89
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,152
a little segment I like to call

90
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,886
"Embarrassing Souvenirs I Picked
Up From Ted's Childhood Home."

91
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,163
(Robin giggles)

92
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,261
(Barney laughs)

93
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:15,603
"Totally
Awesome Ted."

94
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,569
What, did you steal this off
some other kid named Ted?

95
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:18,998
I'm just getting
warmed up here.

96
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,332
(laughing):
This is fun.

97
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,238
We're all...
you know, it's...

98
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,870
I'm having fun.
(Marshall chuckles)

99
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,244
When you squeeze this toy,
a recording of Ted says,

100
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:28,444
"I wuv you, Mommy!"

101
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:29,706
Oh, but
that's sweet!

102
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,553
Why would we make
fun of him for that?

103
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,279
He gave it to her
when he was 19.

104
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,784
TED (recorded):
I wuv you, Mommy.

105
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,115
(laughing)

106
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,350
And lastly, a photo
of young Ted

107
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:43,288
and his best friend
dressed up like cowboys.

108
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,294
No, oh, all right.

109
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,625
Leave him alone.

110
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,129
His best friend
was a balloon.

111
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,260
ROBIN:
I want to see that picture

112
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:49,256
more than I want
to get married!

113
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,801
(laughing)

114
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,072
I hate you so much.

115
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:56,942
(deep voice):
Oo yah maya stupa koon!

116
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,970
Ho ho ho ho!

117
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,636
NARRATOR:
Over the years, we'd seen

118
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,814
all sorts of levels
of Barney's drunkenness.

119
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,243
How you doin'?

120
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,548
NARRATOR:
"Richard Dawson drunk..."

121
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,249
Ah, is this
your sister?

122
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,222
NARRATOR:
"Big plans with strangers
drunk..."

123
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,220
Hey!

124
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,791
Me and the Road Dawgs

125
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,490
going splitsies on a time-share
in Flint, Michigan!

126
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,493
And...

127
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:19,625
non-refundably booked!

128
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,300
Come on! I'm gonna buy
you all some mopeds!

129
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,730
Road Dawgs!

130
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,674
NARRATOR:
And "Marcel Marceau drunk..."

131
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,835
But we knew the night was over
whenever Barney got...

132
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,840
"Jabba drunk."

133
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,011
So drunk that his speech

134
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,810
bore an uncanny
resemblance to that of...

135
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:38,012
Jabba the Hutt from
Return of the Jedi.

136
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,175
Bo shuda!

137
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,252
Ha ha ha!

138
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,180
Okay, we have to go to bed.

139
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,445
Big day tomorrow.

140
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,594
Big day tomorrow!
Noon-eeg Han Solo!

141
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,588
MARSHALL:
Screw tomorrow!

142
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,249
Let's go big tonight!

143
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,187
We go big
tonight!
Ah wotto potto tapa ho!

144
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,532
No, Marshall, let's go now.

145
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,590
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

146
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,327
Look, I-I guess we
have to do this.

147
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:58,203
Okay, first off, I know how
important Italy was to you...

148
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,201
Shut up and do me!

149
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,369
Okay, we have
to go to bed.

150
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,505
Yeah.

151
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,484
Yeah.
I need to get

152
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,509
my ear hair trimmed
in the morning.

153
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,514
It's like a rain forest
in there.

154
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,216
Uh, why would you volunteer
that information?

155
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,648
Because it's the truth.

156
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:20,224
Also, I peed a little
on my tie at the urinal.

157
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:24,063
Uh, Barney...
who's taller: me or you?

158
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,361
You're taller.
I wear lifts in all my shoes.

159
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,734
Oh, my God, Robin...

160
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,031
Barney has reached
a whole new level.

161
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,203
He's "truth serum drunk."

162
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,802
He can't lie.

163
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,544
So we can finally
get the answers

164
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,239
we've always
been wondering about.

165
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,640
Look, I know you said
you had to go to bed,

166
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,672
but I really think...

167
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,137
Screw tomorrow!

168
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,314
We go big tonight.

169
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,912
Yeah.

170
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,314
Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.

171
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,246
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

172
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,221
We're not unpaused?

173
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,319
Not yet.

174
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,590
Mama needs some Papa.

175
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,049
But as soon as we're
done having sex,

176
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,046
we are having that fight!

177
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,857
Wait, so we're...

178
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,029
not gonna fight

179
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:01,058
until after we're
done having sex.

180
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,264
Challenge accepted.

181
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,742
Um, so... just,
just to be clear,

182
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,270
after we finish
having sex,

183
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,914
that's when we'll
have our fight?

184
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
That's right.

185
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,114
Excuse me.

186
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,375
Okay, Marshall.

187
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,718
It's go time.

188
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,763
You've had great nights
of sex before,

189
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,388
most of them with Lily,

190
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,023
a few by yourself--

191
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,788
and we'll always have that

192
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,126
Unscrambled Spice Channel
Glitch of '93--

193
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,872
but this has got to be
the performance of a lifetime.

194
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,698
Jimi Hendrix at Monterey.

195
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,873
James Brown at the Apollo.

196
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,042
Your law school funk band
pretty much anywhere.

197
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,871
So get out there

198
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,276
and bang your wife for
as long as you possibly can!

199
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,651
Not a good sign that
I'm already out of breath.

200
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,994
So... Barney will answer

201
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,990
any question we ask him
with the truth?

202
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,323
I think so.

203
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,387
Honey...

204
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,926
when that Bryan Adams song
came on the radio,

205
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,103
did two mosquitoes
really fly into your eyes

206
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,132
at the same time?

207
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,666
No.

208
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:16,772
I got all choked up
thinking about how

209
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,944
everything he does,
he does it for her.

210
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,413
Checks out.

211
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,511
Okay, what next?

212
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,783
I mean, it's...

213
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,151
it's so hard to know
where to begin.

214
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,178
I mean, there are so many...

215
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,683
What did you do to my mom?!

216
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,282
BARNEY:
Well, that night,

217
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,017
we were in my car...

218
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,452
I was wrong!
I can't handle this!

219
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,457
Uh, just tell me
in baseball terms.

220
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,689
I got thrown out
trying to stretch

221
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,025
a single into a double.

222
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,189
(gasps)

223
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,900
I can live with that.

224
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,198
How about that time
you walked into the bar

225
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,144
wearing "Triple-X-Ray Goggles"?

226
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,511
Well, hello,
you two lovely ladies.

227
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,781
What are you wearing?

228
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,308
Oh, hey, Robin,
didn't see you there.

229
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,013
Just Triple-X-Ray Goggles,
no big deal.
Oh...

230
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,206
There is no way
those things work.

231
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,978
I'm not even here.

232
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,846
Just act natural.

233
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,521
Right.

234
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,827
'Cause that jacket's
made of lead.

235
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,159
Those things
didn't work, did they?

236
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,804
Absolutely. Lily's boobs
always work for me.

237
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,370
Oh, the goggles?
No.

238
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,798
Next question.

239
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,004
You keep saying "ring bear"

240
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,567
instead of ring bear-er.

241
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,875
Will there or will there not

242
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,910
be a bear at our wedding?

243
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,475
The truth is...

244
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,224
aggle flaggle klabble.

245
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,989
Wumby flappy snurp...

246
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,688
Oh, my God, he's dipped back
down to Jabba drunk!

247
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,750
Give him
another drink!

248
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,588
Come on.

249
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,733
Oh, yeah, baby.

250
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,588
I could go all night.

251
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,027
I can't hold out much longer!

252
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,402
What are the least arousing
things I can think of?

253
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,841
* Day-old roadkill

254
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,238
* Ah, yeah...

255
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,770
* Fingernail

256
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:03,376
* Fingernail clippings

257
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,910
* That is some dull stuff

258
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:10,416
* How your TMJ night guard
smells in the morning *

259
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,720
* Nasty

260
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,763
* Bugs...

261
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,218
* Mmm

262
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,627
* More bugs

263
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,260
MARSHALL:
It's working! It's working!

264
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,064
Uh-oh, it's working too well.

265
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,397
Think sexy thoughts.
Think sexy thoughts!

266
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,774
* Bugs with boobs...

267
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,244
LILY:
Marshall, are
you all right?

268
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,612
You don't seem
to be, um...

269
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:36,641
Please, uh,
excuse Medium-Sized Fudge.

270
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,408
6 and 3/64 inches.

271
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,777
Yeah, he's back
to telling the truth.

272
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,215
Okay, Barney,

273
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,790
how are you always able
to do that magic trick

274
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,418
where you make doves appear?

275
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,663
Special dehydrated birds
I get in Chinatown.

276
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,055
I knew it!

277
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,304
(sighs)
Okay. Okay.

278
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,669
Will there or will there not

279
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,129
be a bear at our wedding?

280
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,638
The truth is...

281
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,970
Barney...
Oh, come on!

282
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,335
I know that you always say

283
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,813
that you don't
need any kind of

284
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,181
"help" in bed,
but if you, um...

285
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,910
I always keep
these on hand.

286
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,405
But be careful.

287
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,746
When you go off, there's
a kickback like a cannon.

288
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,623
Thank you.

289
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,662
How much a year
do you spend on suits?

290
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,459
NARRATOR:
Kids, I won't bother you
with the number,

291
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,461
but it was a crapload.

292
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,333
Around one crapload.

293
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,831
That much?

294
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,203
Well... aren't you concerned
about your future?

295
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,671
Nope.

296
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,300
Especially since Robin
is massively wealthy.

297
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,704
Barney!
What?

298
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:36,936
You're rich?

299
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,110
L-Like how rich?

300
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,308
It's my family's money,
not mine.

301
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,369
I-I don't really know how much.

302
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,777
How much is her family worth?

303
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,339
6,000 craploads.

304
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,676
Canadian craploads.

305
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,052
That much?!

306
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,009
But when we dated,

307
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,317
I paid for everything.

308
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,018
You didn't pay for everything.

309
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,280
He paid for everything.

310
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,848
I pick up our bar tab
all the time.

311
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,486
Three times
in the last nine years.

312
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,691
I took you out to tons
of four-star restaurants.

313
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:58,134
Two-star restaurants.

314
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,558
Figuring, on average,
two meals out a week

315
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,032
plus 20% tip...

316
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,401
12 and a half percent tip.

317
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,559
Do you know
how much money you cost me?

318
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,897
What am I?
A prostitute?

319
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,373
You are not a prostitute.

320
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,500
No, a prostitute
would've been cheaper.

321
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,466
Depends on the prostitute.

322
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,574
Wait, hold on, Ted.
What are we doing?

323
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,376
You're arguing
about Robin's wealth

324
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,508
when you really should be asking
me embarrassing questions.

325
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,054
He's right.

326
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,209
Let's do this.

327
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,507
NARRATOR:
And so we did it.

328
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,148
We asked Barney
all the questions

329
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,153
we'd always wanted to.

330
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,854
In one night? Four.

331
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,487
In one family? Three.

332
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,892
Yes, but not while she
was secretary of state.

333
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,496
Yes, but not while she was
secretary of state.

334
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,899
Just once.

335
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,901
With a French male model Henri.

336
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,274
It was late.

337
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,102
We were the last two people
in the club.

338
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,567
I was lonely and I figured,
why not try it?

339
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,575
That was the only time
I ever split a cab.

340
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,410
Yes, but not the M.I.T.
you're thinking of.

341
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,246
The Magician's Institute
of Teaneck.

342
00:11:56,283 --> 00:12:00,053
I've had sex
in Ted's bed 14 times.

343
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,557
I asked if you wear
shoulder pads.

344
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,090
I think I've just got
one question left.

345
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,726
And it's a biggie.

346
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,755
Barney Stinson...

347
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,068
what do you do for a living?

348
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:16,966
You did it.

349
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:19,774
You banged your wife to sleep.

350
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,977
Nice job...

351
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,307
...Still-Big Fudge.

352
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,122
TED:
I wuv you, Mommy.

353
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,291
Unpause.

354
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,591
NARRATOR:
Kids, in all the time
we knew Barney,

355
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,997
there was one question he would
always answer the same way.

356
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,760
Seriously, what is it
that you do?

357
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,168
(chuckles) Please.

358
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,169
Okay, seriously.

359
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
What do you do for a living?

360
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,496
(chuckles) Please.

361
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,637
Are you finally gonna tell me
exactly what your job is?

362
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,412
(chuckles) Please.

363
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,111
So, naturally, this was
a pretty big moment for us.

364
00:12:57,144 --> 00:13:01,114
Well, what do you do
for a living?

365
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,421
Please.

366
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,693
(groans)
God, he's not telling us.

367
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,690
More booze.

368
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,161
Not so fast, princess.

369
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,961
I guess subtle clues
and the bar tab

370
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,003
are two things
you just don't pick up.

371
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,128
Because...

372
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,603
I think he is telling us.

373
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,871
Tell us more about this job.

374
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,099
BARNEY:
Well, as you know,

375
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,696
back in my hippie days,

376
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,637
a businessman came
into my coffee shop,

377
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,483
told me money was
all that mattered,

378
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,008
and stole my girlfriend.

379
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:33,513
That's when I decided
to become awesome.

380
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,046
But I had no idea how to break
into the corporate world.

381
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,524
So, hoping he wouldn't
recognize me,

382
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,291
I went to the one person
from whom

383
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
I knew I could learn
everything.

384
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,315
Do we know each other, bro?

385
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,827
We're all connected
in Gaia's great tapestry of...

386
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,861
(clears throat)
No.

387
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,227
We don't.

388
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,074
Bro.

389
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,704
Wow, you went to M.I.T.

390
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,065
Pretty impressive.

391
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,744
I did get a perfect score
on the A.C.T.'s.

392
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,742
Advanced Card Tricks.

393
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,975
Well, look, buddy.

394
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,551
You got a sweet rÃ©sumÃ©.

395
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,508
But we don't have any openings
you're qualified for.

396
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,247
They set me up!
It was a trap! It's a trap!

397
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,845
We have one opening
you'd be perfect for.

398
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,918
Great. What do I do?

399
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,987
Please.

400
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,186
"Provide Legal Exculpation
And Sign Everything."

401
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,658
Just show up every day,

402
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,325
scribble your name on
a bunch of documents,

403
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,404
and we'll pay you
16 craploads a year.

404
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,837
Deets are in the contract.

405
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,938
I'll give you time
to think about it.

406
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,844
I'll take it.

407
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,172
Hold on.

408
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,777
Did you even read this
before signing it?

409
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,708
No.

410
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,113
(laughs)
You're hired.

411
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:41,677
We'll work on that.

412
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,954
TED:
Wait.

413
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,383
That's your job?

414
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,247
You sign sketchy,
legally binding documents

415
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,416
that could implicate you
for God knows what?

416
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,585
Best job ever, right?

417
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,794
No more pausing.

418
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,556
We're getting
through this argument.

419
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,425
Okay.

420
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,434
No potshots at my mom.

421
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,196
Fine, no distracting me
with your calves.

422
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,404
Fine.

423
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,477
I love you, Lilypad.

424
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,109
I love you, Marshmallow.

425
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,054
(deep breath)
Now...

426
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,710
(exhales)

427
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,947
...how could you take
that job without telling me?!

428
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,315
Baby, I'm sorry, but they needed
an answer right away.

429
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,623
This is a huge opportunity,

430
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,164
it could be very good
for our family,

431
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,130
and we have to
at least talk about it.

432
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,828
Sorry, you lost your chance
to talk about it

433
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,960
when you didn't talk about it.

434
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,273
We're going to Italy.

435
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,929
But I could be a judge.

436
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,837
We can't give that up for
what is clearly just a hobby.

437
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,009
Pause.

438
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,308
No pause.

439
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,239
That "hobby" is my dream.

440
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,944
We're going to Italy.

441
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,006
But it's my dream to...

442
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,314
We are going to Italy!

443
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,645
Baby, can you just...?

444
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,279
We are going to Italy!

445
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,515
Don't you get it?

446
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,649
You went behind my back.

447
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,354
You hurt me.

448
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:57,316
You were more selfish
than I have ever been to you.

449
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:02,227
You broke up with me
and moved to San Francisco.

450
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,173
Barney!
You're being stupid.

451
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,668
The-the-the company is
setting you up as their fall guy

452
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,270
for all of their
illegal activities.

453
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,113
No, you guys are being stupid.

454
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,610
Especially Ted.

455
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,541
What? I didn't say anything.

456
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:20,106
NARRATOR:
And then, kids, Barney revealed
to us his master plan.

457
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,617
It all went down a few months
after the wedding.

458
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,479
Hey, Greg?

459
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:25,847
I know you're busy,

460
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,885
but FYI, I've been colluding
with the Feds.

461
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,190
They know everything.

462
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,692
And they're
on their way up right now

463
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,363
to shut down this division
and arrest you.

464
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,692
Door closed or...?

465
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,026
What?

466
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,362
Why would you do that?

467
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,026
Oh, gosh,
countless moral reasons...

468
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,796
could have applied,

469
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,243
but this is pretty much revenge
for stealing my girlfriend.

470
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,911
See? That day, I vowed

471
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,378
I would do everything
in my power to track you down,

472
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,078
gain your trust,

473
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,810
and then destroy you.

474
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,075
Who are you?

475
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,154
Who am I?

476
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,522
Just a guy

477
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,349
who served you coffee once.

478
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,685
Peace out, loser.

479
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,489
* Barney Stinson,
Barney Stinson *

480
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,521
You son of a bitch!
* That guy's awesome

481
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,926
I will destroy you!
Get your hands off of me.
* Awesome

482
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,058
* Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

483
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,326
* Awesome.

484
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,774
Why are you

485
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,399
bringing up San Francisco?

486
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,374
That was seven years ago.

487
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:20,673
Because you are being
selfish all over again.

488
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:25,177
Marshall, I apologized
over and over again.

489
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,952
Now you're saying you
never have forgiven me?

490
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,350
There is

491
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,952
nothing more important to me
than our family.

492
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,254
You know that.

493
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,786
Well, let me ask.

494
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,991
What if you had found
success in San Francisco?

495
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,234
How do I know that you even

496
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,459
would've come back to me?

497
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,233
Stop it.

498
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,702
Are Marvin and I

499
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,300
and any other future children
we may have

500
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,943
just some consolation prize?

501
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,098
I have to get out of here.

502
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,370
Babe?

503
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,637
(door slams)

504
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,906
So, Barney,

505
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,384
I still haven't
heard you pronounce

506
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,812
that last syllable.

507
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,981
At our wedding, will there be

508
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,447
a ring bear-er?

509
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,987
(deep breath)

510
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,691
The truth is...

511
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,628
...yes, there will be
a ring bear-er.

512
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,561
His name is Trevor Hudson,

513
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,726
I worked with his mother,
and he's adorable.

514
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,565
I want our wedding
to be perfect, Robin.

515
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,371
Me, too.

516
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,507
Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs.

517
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,768
He's okay to crash
with you, right?

518
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,676
Yup, we'll see you
in the morning.

519
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,308
Hmm.

520
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,513
I love you.

521
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,314
I love you, too.

522
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,987
Okay, I got one last question
for you.

523
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,119
And I can't believe
I haven't asked it yet.

524
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,815
Dude, you're getting
married tomorrow.

525
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,932
How are you doing?
Good.

526
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,500
I mean, I'm a little nervous,

527
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,270
but I love Robin more than
I've ever loved anyone,

528
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,941
and I'm gonna do everything
I can to make her happy.

529
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,439
For a long time,

530
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,611
deep down,

531
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,810
I've felt sort of...

532
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,112
broken?

533
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,513
But...

534
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:08,005
I don't feel that way anymore.

535
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,277
Robin, along with the idea

536
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,047
that vengeance
will soon be mine,

537
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,885
has made me 100% awesome.

538
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,193
I'm proud of you, buddy.

539
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,185
Globan froban.

540
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,228
Ho, ho, ho.

541
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,232
Okay.

542
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,503
Come on, Jabba.

543
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,501
Big day tomorrow.

544
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,632
(grunts)
Tab for the night?

545
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,367
Just so you know,

546
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,712
those last few rounds of 35-year
Glen McKenna were not cheap.

547
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,739
Whoa.

548
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,143
Um... you know what?

549
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,475
Charge them to the bride's room.

550
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,650
Thank you.

551
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,648
Come on.
(muttering)

552
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,579
Let's go. We got you.

553
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,424
NARRATOR: Kids, it's your
grandmother's favorite rule.

554
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,651
Nothing good happens
after 2:00 a.m.

555
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,816
Hi. I-I know it's late,
but I've got to get out of here.

556
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,886
Marshall and I
just had a huge fight.

557
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,155
You will?

558
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,934
Oh, my God, thank you.

559
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,908
TED: You good, yeah?
THE MOTHER: Yeah.

560
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,346
Okay.

561
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,383
Okay.

562
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,447
Everything is fine.

563
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,545
Okay? Just don't freak out.

564
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:20,546
I'm not freaking out.

565
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:21,587
I was talking to myself.

566
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,091
Do you have the baby?

567
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,692
The elevator!
What?!

568
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,134
Marshall and Lily are right.
It never gets old.

569
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,628
Unless you're crowning.

570
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,460
So proud of you.
Thank you.

571
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,126
Penny is so proud of you.

572
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,773
Let's go get you a brother.

573
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,369
Okay?
Hmm?

574
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,471
You want a brother?
All right?

575
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,472
I love you.
I love you, too.

576
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,444
You're gonna be great.

577
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,071
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

578
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,536
NARRATOR: Nothing good happens
after 2:00 a.m.

579
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,944
It's a good rule.

580
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,105
But every rule
has an exception.

581
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,784
And for us,
that exception was you, Luke.

582
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,724
We're having a baby!

583
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,749
(yells)

584
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,325
(chain dragging)

585
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,088
Come on, Trevor Hudson.

586
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,226
It's feeding time.

587
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,162
(roaring)

588
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,527
