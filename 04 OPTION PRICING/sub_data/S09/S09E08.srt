00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,143
NARRATOR: Kids,
Barney's mom had this blouse

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,212
that she absolutely loved,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,040
but then Robin won it
in a poker game,

4
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:10,136
which led
to some slight awkwardness.

5
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:13,878
You won the battle...
but I'll win the war.

6
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,884
Game on, bitch.

7
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,186
BARNEY: Please, Mom,
I need you to just be cool.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,850
Okay, can you do that for me?

9
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:21,888
For you, yes.

10
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,222
And for Robin?

11
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:24,757
(scoffs)
She's gonna be

12
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,692
your daughter in 33 hours.

13
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:27,657
Daughter in law.

14
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,025
Making it illegal

15
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:31,003
for you not
to treat her like a daughter.

16
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,401
In-lawyered.

17
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:34,501
Please, Mom.

18
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,235
All Robin wants to do is
put this whole thing behind her

19
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,041
so she can get married and
put this whole thing behind her.

20
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,014
Ah! Get-this-over-with-quickly
so-we-can

21
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,052
move-past-how-awkward-it-was
that-I-just-said-that five!

22
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,049
Fine. If Robin's ready
to bury the hatchet,

23
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,921
then I guess
I'm ready to bury the hatchet.

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,590
Morning, bitches.
Like my new blouse?

25
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,460
Oh, hell, no!
No, Mom. Mom!

26
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,588
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

NARRATOR: Kids, not far
from the Farhampton Inn,

29
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,774
there's a lighthouse.

30
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,705
It's a really special place,

31
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,141
and that morning
I wanted to see it for myself.

32
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:17,377
There was just one problem.

33
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,751
Look, I'm sorry, Ted, but-but

34
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,380
I can't in good faith send
a lonely guy like yourself

35
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,616
to the top
of a very romantic,

36
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:27,462
and more to the point,
a very tall lighthouse.

37
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,318
(whistles, blows raspberry)

38
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:31,957
I don't want your blood
on my hands,

39
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,932
and I mean that literally,
because it would be my job to...

40
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,172
to hose down the rocks.

00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,298
NARRATOR:
Now, late the night before,

42
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,073
thanks to Marshall's
travel companion, Daphne,

43
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,812
Lily had received
some unsettling news.

44
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,438
I'm gonna be a judge.

45
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,644
NARRATOR: Screwing up their
whole plan to move to Italy.

46
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:49,836
She wasn't happy.

47
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,477
Yes, I'm in a rotten mood.

48
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,082
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

49
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,453
Yes, this has
booze in it.

50
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:55,952
No, it's not
my first.

51
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,253
You want to make this brunch
a drunch?

52
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,316
You do you, I'm not gonna judge.

53
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,020
I'm gonna be a judge.

54
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,726
Judge.

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,430
Thank you, Linus.

56
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,933
NARRATOR:
As for Marshall and Daphne,

57
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,374
they got caught
in that big storm.

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,770
Luckily, they had a place
to crash for the night.

59
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,772
My childhood home.

60
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:20,014
Okay, that sign
might not have been there.

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,540
Thank you so much for letting
us stay the night, Mrs. Mosby.

62
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,806
Oh, it's our pleasure.

63
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,854
I'm just glad
that storm has passed.
Oh.

64
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,979
But there's one storm
that hasn't passed,

65
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,945
isn't there, Marshall?

66
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,993
Hey, Clint.

67
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,849
CLINT:
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you, Marshall?

68
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,157
I'm talking about the one
that's been raining

69
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,659
cats and dogs all over
this-this, this friendship.

70
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,162
This isn't a friendship.

71
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,534
Oh.

72
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,462
Nice.

73
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,197
We're reluctant
travel companions.

74
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:47,574
Well, little known fact
about me.

75
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,041
I'm an almost-graduate

76
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,139
of the Conflict Resolution
program over at... at Tri-C.

77
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,182
I even had my own practice
at Van Aken Plaza

78
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,209
before the manager
of the Wendy's

79
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,214
made me stop hogging the booth.

80
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:00,876
The point is,
I can fix this.

81
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,524
Oh, I don't know, Clint.

82
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,980
(strums upbeat melody)

83
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,147
* Gonna resolve some conflicts

84
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,556
* Gonna resolve
some conflicts *

85
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,988
* Gonna make
a deeper understanding *

86
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,593
* Through mediation.

87
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,585
Okay, you know what?
We have to hit the road.

88
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:17,157
But, um, Mrs. Mosby, do you
mind if I take this mug?

89
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,827
I would very much like

90
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,896
to make fun of Ted
next time I see him.

91
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,174
Of course.

92
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,672
You know, when Ted was seven,

93
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,244
he and his best friend
took this Wild West photo

94
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,614
together at Geauga Lake.

95
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,081
I could go look for it.

96
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,509
We really should get going.

97
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,684
His best friend was a balloon.

98
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,852
What's a few more minutes?

99
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,920
Yeah, you're gonna want that.

100
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,348
So... what's everyone
doing this morning?

101
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,915
Oh, well, I kind of feel
like playing some tennis.

102
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,293
Maybe we should reserve a court.

103
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,662
Court.

104
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,525
Thank you, Linus.

105
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,561
Pancakes and eggs, Robin?

106
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,727
I guess that blouse won't be
loose and flowy for long.

107
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,526
Mom...

108
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,597
Keep talking, Loretta.

109
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,965
I've been waiting
all morning to...

110
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,744
ketchup.

111
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,072
Oops.

112
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:04,037
You're not supposed to put
ketchup on scrambled eggs.

113
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,777
Right, Loretta, because

114
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,123
you're the queen
of scrambled eggs.

115
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:08,978
BARNEY:
Actually, that's

116
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,546
exactly what she is.

117
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,724
When Mom was

118
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,052
a groupie in the '70s,

119
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,616
her scrambled eggs made her the
darling of the MSG loading dock.

120
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,987
Lot of songs written
about those scrambled eggs.

121
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,786
ZZ Top's "She's Got Legs"?

122
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,498
Originally "She's Got Eggs."

123
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,330
Led Zeppelin?

124
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,774
"Scramble On."

125
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,128
Steve Miller?

126
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,466
"The Yolker."

127
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,801
If you listen to Pink Floyd's
Dark Side of the Moon

128
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,807
while eating her eggs,
it lines up perfectly.

129
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,180
While I'm sure it was
your mother's cooking skills

130
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,909
that made her so popular with
Zed Zed Top and their ilk,

131
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,477
I know for a fact

132
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,075
that she does not make
the best scrambled eggs.

133
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,417
Because my mom makes
the best scrambled eggs.

134
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,185
(gasps)

135
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,992
NARRATOR:
Kids, we've known
your Aunt Robin

136
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,994
for eight years at that point,

137
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,156
and here's what we knew
about her mom.

138
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,125
My mom is terrified
of flying.

139
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,933
(bell dings)

140
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,925
My mom got stung
by a jellyfish.

141
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,267
(bell dings)

142
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,801
My mom makes
the best scrambled eggs.

143
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,036
(bell dings)

144
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,011
NARRATOR:
And... that's everything.

145
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,179
In fact, she should be here
any minute.

146
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,478
Barney,

147
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,310
maybe she can cook you
some real scrambled eggs

148
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,105
so you can see what
you've been missing.

149
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,376
Don't do this, Robin.
You can't win the egg war.

150
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,146
Canadian scrambled eggs,
how quaint.

151
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,354
Does your mom put maple syrup
on them?

152
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,357
Ha, ha, ha,
this is all very friendly.

153
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,789
(whispering):
Get out of this now.

154
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,193
Why not? We put maple syrup
on everything else.

155
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,034
BARNEY:
Aw.

156
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,561
That's it!

157
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,828
We need your omelet station.

158
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,236
My son's fiancÃ©e is
about to get served...

159
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,569
some delicious
scrambled eggs.

160
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:41,876
Or I could go out to the
driveway and eat some gravel.

161
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,139
(soft grunt)

162
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,306
Wait. Sorry.
Did you say gravel or gavel?

163
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,675
Gravel. Why would
I say gavel?

164
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:47,884
Gavel.

165
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,019
(sighs)

166
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,152
Thank you, Linus.

167
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,016
Curtis, can I please

168
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,085
have a map to the lighthouse?

169
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,994
It's a very romantic lighthouse.

170
00:05:59,026 --> 00:05:59,986
I can't even have a map?

171
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,257
It's a very romantic map.

172
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,195
I can't let you go
without a date.

173
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,731
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

174
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,096
What happened to
that girl Cassie?
Cassie?

175
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,095
NARRATOR:
Cassie was the girl I'd spent

176
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,767
the entire previous night
consoling.

177
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:15,005
Just consoling.

178
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,012
Yeah, that's not happening.

179
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,053
NARRATOR:
And then, in her anger,

180
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,908
Lily gave me a piece of advice

181
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,247
about which
she would later say...

182
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,351
Oh, mama, that was
some bad advice.

183
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,254
Okay, here's why
you're an idiot.

184
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,586
Did you find
Cassie attractive?

185
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,892
I guess.
Is she a relatively
normal height?

186
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,755
Yeah.
So end up with
her already.

187
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,755
God, do you really think

188
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,867
that you're gonna find
some perfect girl

189
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,099
who checks off every
item on your list?

190
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,395
Well, not every item.

191
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,867
I mean, she doesn't have
to share my love for coins.

192
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,076
Although it would
be nice, just once,

193
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,648
not to have to go stag
to Coin-Con.

194
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,949
Pull your head out
of your ass, Mosby.

195
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:57,081
Do you think Marshall
always makes me happy?

196
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,047
I mean, sometimes being
with him is a real trial.

197
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,157
Real trial.

198
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,259
Huh.

199
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,990
Did it to myself that time.

200
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,755
Look, Ted, it's
time to settle.

201
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,826
Take this normal-sized chick
up to the lighthouse

202
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,174
and fall in love with her

203
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,069
and quit bothering us with
your dumb love life stuff.

204
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,113
God, I am so sick of being
smarter than everyone else.

205
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:21,678
You're slipping, Linus.

206
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:24,039
We're running
out of glasses.

207
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,947
Do you want to just go
to the stupid lighthouse?

208
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,986
Ooh, zitch dog.

209
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,592
Cocker spaniel in the Jetta.

210
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,794
That's Marshall
Eriksen-- 28,

211
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:39,856
Daphne-- zero.

212
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,603
For the 28th time,

213
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,859
I'm not playing
your stupid game!

214
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,127
Oh, stupid, huh?

215
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,325
That's great.

216
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,336
I guess Daphne gets
to pick the music

217
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,968
and crap all over
my fun road-trip games.

218
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,014
(sighs)
You know, maybe
Clint was right.

219
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,210
Maybe we do need
conflict resolution.

220
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,382
I knew you guys
would come around.

221
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,209
(Daphne and Marshall screaming)

222
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,693
NARRATOR:
And so I made up my mind
to settle for Cassie.

223
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,489
So, um, what kind
of music do you like?

224
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,092
Hmm... nothing.

225
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,334
NARRATOR:
Still, I felt optimistic.

226
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,332
After all,
Cassie was cute and single

227
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,874
and heck, it's not like
the universe was telling us

228
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,170
we shouldn't be together.

229
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,879
Here we are. Enjoy.

230
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,039
Remember: happy wife,
happy life.

231
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,577
Pretend
they're just okay.

232
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,622
Please, Lily,
I think I can manage to...

233
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,719
Oh, my God.

234
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,921
I'm eight years
old again,

235
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,092
and life is perfect,

236
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,720
and I haven't peed my shorts
in front of 350 Webelos

237
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,326
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

238
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,528
I'm sorry, Robin.

239
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,930
What do you think, Lily?

240
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,501
Oh, my God,
they are so delicious.

241
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,930
Even more delicious than
finding out Barney peed himself

242
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,736
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

243
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,239
I'm sorry, Robin.

244
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,210
Mmm.
Come on,

245
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,208
they can't be
that good.

246
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,109
Oh!

247
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,011
Excuse me, Mrs. Stinson,
some of our guests

248
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,913
smelled your scrambled eggs
and were wondering

249
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,945
if you could make some
for them as well.

250
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,780
(laughing):
Oh, I don't think I should...

251
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:12,016
CROWD (chanting):
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!

252
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,392
Eggs! Eggs!
(sighs)

253
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,920
Clint, what are
you doing here?

254
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,585
What the Ohio State Board of
Holistic Medicine has repeatedly

255
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,955
told me I'm in no way qualified
to do: my job.

256
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,104
When I see a conflict
needs resolving, I must act.

257
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,031
Plus, Ted's mom wanted me out
of the house.

258
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,136
So, today, we're gonna build
a new paradigm

259
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,798
of understanding,

260
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:32,467
and then you're gonna swoop me
on back to Shaker Heights.

261
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,565
Oh, I need to stop

262
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,107
at Record Rev on Coventry.

263
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,382
My vaporizer's ready.

264
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,079
Marshall, pull over
and dump this hippie

265
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,281
on the side of the road.

266
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,752
I can't do that.

267
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,381
CLINT:
* Gonna resolve
some conflicts *

268
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,115
* Gonna resolve some conflicts

269
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,491
Daphne picks the music.

270
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,988
* Gonna end this argument

271
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,560
* Between Marshall
and his mistress. *

272
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,318
Oh, come on.
Daphne picks
the music!

273
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:53,227
Ow! Stupid racecar!

274
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,400
This is why children
should not have toys!

275
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,298
Look, maybe this lighthouse
thing isn't such a good idea.

276
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,330
No, you don't.

277
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,129
You committed,

278
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,167
and so did I, so let's go.

279
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,306
Oh. Ow! Oh!

280
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,138
Actually, it's feeling better.
(laughs)

281
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,784
Ow! Oh! No, it's not.

282
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,839
Oh. (whimpering)

283
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,608
Mom, I don't know
why your phone is off.

284
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,776
Maybe you left your charger
in the pickup truck.

285
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:15,945
(bell dings)

286
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,923
But I need you to get here
as fast as possible.

287
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:18,991
I know
you're probably gonna want

288
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,189
to take a hot bath
when you get in.

289
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,120
(bell dings)

290
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,094
She fits in a bathtub.

291
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,122
That's good news. Unless...

292
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,127
Oh, God, how big are
Canadian bathtubs?

293
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,159
(bell dings)
LORETTA:
People ever line up

294
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,695
like this for your mom's eggs?

295
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,600
Loretta, even I could make
better eggs than this.

296
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,343
Oh, I'd love it
if you'd come teach me

297
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,538
how to make scrambled eggs.

298
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,439
It's a scramble-off,
everybody!

299
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,471
A scramble-off
to the death!

300
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,837
Someone go watch
for the cops!

301
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,946
Maybe we should have read up
on this town

302
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,148
before booking our wedding.

303
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,950
Let's do some,
"When you... I feel."

304
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,223
All right, for example,

305
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:54,621
when you don't
do trust falls,

306
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,734
I feel like you
should do trust falls.

307
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,189
So just do the
damn trust falls.

308
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,298
I'm driving a car, Clint.

309
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,859
Okay,

310
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,697
uh, Daphne, when you say
"Drill, baby, drill"

311
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:09,544
every time
that we pass a gas station,

312
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,469
I feel invalidated.

313
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,014
Marshall, when you talk,
I feel shut up!

314
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,911
That's very good, both of you.

315
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:17,713
Really? Both of us?

316
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,005
Name one energy
that's better than oil.

317
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,407
Wind, solar, hydroelectric.

318
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,078
You see what I've been dealing
with, Clint?

319
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,246
* The sticky petroleum
clings... *

320
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,585
Please not now, Clint.

321
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,259
* To the pelican's
broken wings *

322
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,059
* Hey, Mr. Oilman,
what have you done... *

323
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,103
Stop, stop, stop, please.
Enough! Clint,

324
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,898
(Marvin crying)
I'm tired of your beard
and I'm tired

325
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,100
of this stupid
therapy session.
And I'm tired

326
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,572
of the way that your songs have
a-a laxative effect on Marvin!

327
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,572
And on me. Every time
Clint starts singing,

328
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,174
I just got to go.
Yeah.

329
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:50,176
It's like, uh, the only
trust fall when you sing

330
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,080
is that I "trust"
that a piece of poop

331
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,724
is gonna "fall" out
of my son's butt.

332
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,091
(laughs)

333
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,719
Hey, Clint, how about that?

334
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,115
You got us to agree
on something.
Yeah.

335
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,056
We both think you're a loser.
(laughs)

336
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,133
This therapy works.

337
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,761
No!

338
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:11,697
That is not the way
therapy works at all!

339
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,601
Do you think this is
some kind of a joke?!

340
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,203
This is my career!

341
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,965
I will not go back to
coaching the Browns!

342
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,035
Why can't people take

343
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,572
what I do seriously?!

344
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,477
God!
(grunting)

345
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,080
(Marvin crying)

346
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,083
(strained):
Oh, my God. One more.

347
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,275
Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, my God.

348
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,888
(panting)

349
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,961
God, that was a lot of stairs.
I'm exhausted.

350
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,960
My chest is on fire.

351
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,392
Oh.

352
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,457
Ooh! So, Mr. Arch-itect,

353
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,167
what do we do now?

354
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,169
Fall in love or something?

355
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,172
NARRATOR:
And, kids, as I stood
on that lighthouse

356
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:54,274
and looked at that girl, I felt
something happen inside me,

357
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,907
something that had only
happened one other time

358
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,754
in my entire adult life.

359
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,978
(retches)

360
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,524
ROBIN:
Okay, scrambled eggs.

361
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,249
Here we go.

362
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,454
Where is the egg opener?

363
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:10,655
Never mind. I'll pre-scramble
them. It's fine.

364
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,455
Okay, fine, Loretta.
You know what? You win.

365
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,264
I don't
know how

366
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,455
to cook egg.

367
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,467
If you don't even know how
to make scrambled eggs,

368
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,869
I just worry what
kind of breakfast

369
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,371
you're gonna be serving
my grandchildren.

370
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,173
Well, lucky you

371
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,535
because that is one thing you
won't ever have to worry about.

372
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,816
Mom, Robin
can't have kids.

373
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,962
Every single job I take on,
it's always the same!

374
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,695
"The coffee maker has to stay
in the office, Clint!"

375
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,500
"You still have to wear pants
on Casual Friday, Clint!"

376
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,404
"We didn't

377
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,695
hire you, Clint!"

378
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,066
Well, God,
I'm-I'm...

379
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,665
I'm just sick of it. I'm si...

380
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,006
Ow. Ow. Oh, I can hear
my blood right now.

381
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,983
I'm having an attack.
I'm having a blood attack.

382
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,052
A blood attack?

383
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,649
Yeah. Pull over. I need...
I-I need to meditate.

384
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,350
I got to get my heart rate down.
I'll... Ow! Pull over.

385
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,693
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Pull over!

386
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,389
Zitch dog, Labradoodle
in a Ford Fusion! Ow!

387
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,022
God...

388
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,187
Robin can't have kids?

389
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,926
But you always wanted children.

390
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,761
No, I always liked children.

391
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,325
I've always wanted a Lamborghini
where there's a hot tub inside.

392
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,496
God, I wish that existed.

393
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,095
So no grandkids.

394
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,571
How long have you known
about this?

395
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,765
I found out last fall.

396
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,877
Robin and I had been
hanging out downtown

397
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,550
at this very cool secret bar.

398
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,779
(dance music playing)
What a lovely place!

399
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,015
Have you ever had
sushi that fresh?

400
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,552
Okay, I am never getting
on a mechanical bull again.

401
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,787
(chuckles)

402
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,791
I can't believe Marshall
and Lily missed out.

403
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,194
Promise me,
if you ever have kids,

404
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,097
you'll sometimes get
a babysitter

405
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,129
and come have an epic night.

406
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:01,695
Oh, and, P.S., bring the
babysitter, she sounds dirty.

407
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,704
Actually, I, uh,
I can't have kids,

408
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,006
so that's not an issue.

409
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,773
Really?

410
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:08,977
Yeah.

411
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,020
Is it weird
that I'm hugging you like this?

412
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:24,358
No, it's not weird.

413
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,325
Now it's weird. Mm-hmm.
Yep, the rain makes it weird.

414
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,834
Mom, I'm not marrying
some future possibility

415
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,137
of starting a family.

416
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,474
I'm marrying a girl.

417
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,036
Who means more to me than kids.

418
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,640
Or my career.

419
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,207
Or even the Lambor-cuzzi,
patent pending.

420
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,478
So please...

421
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,624
...be nice to her?

422
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,785
DAPHNE:
This is ridiculous.

423
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,334
Get out there
and drag Clint's

424
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,499
downward-facing ass back in here
so we can get going.

425
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,169
Just let him do his thing.

426
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,168
(sighs)

427
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,004
Do you know why
the Daphnes of the world

428
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,836
always get to pick the music

429
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,140
and the Marshalls pay
all the tolls?

430
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,113
Because
the Marshalls

431
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,941
are so concerned

432
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,005
with letting everybody
do their thing,

433
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:21,005
and the Daphnes
are taking care of Daphne.

434
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:25,048
You can talk to me about solar
or wind or hydro-whatever,

435
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,645
but the world is always gonna
push you around, Marshall.

436
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,157
Until you learn
to go nuclear.

437
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,490
(tribal drums playing)

438
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,396
(starts engine)

439
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,928
What are you doing?

440
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,126
Is this real?

441
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,098
Are you doing this?

442
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,066
We need some driving music.

443
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:49,135
No!

444
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,076
(sucks air through teeth)

445
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,180
You threw a live grenade
into my marriage.

446
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,881
You screwed up my whole world.

447
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,986
So from now on...

448
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,719
we listen to my music.

449
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,363
* But I would walk 500 miles

450
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,734
* And I would walk 500 more...

451
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,432
I hate this song.

452
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,804
Give it time.

453
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:18,505
Zitch dog, beagle
in a Beetle.

454
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,938
Don't let Loretta
get to you.

455
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,283
Hey, when your mom gets here,
do you want to all go--

456
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:28,121
I don't know--
avoid jellyfish?

457
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,018
She's not coming.

458
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,418
What?

459
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,020
I finally got a hold of her.

460
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,091
She, um, never got on the plane.

461
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,591
She was too scared.

462
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,263
She won't be
at her daughter's wedding.

463
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,291
(bell dings)

464
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,395
("Try a Little Tenderness"
by Otis Redding playing)

465
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,632
If that is the case...

466
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,967
can we tell Barney
she's super fat?

467
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,213
It would mean the world to me.

468
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,410
(chuckles)

469
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,841
Of course.

470
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,306
Oh, here we go.

471
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:59,775
Listen, Robin...
Loretta,

472
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,122
not now. Robin just found out

473
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,779
her mom's not coming
to the wedding.

474
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,164
Oh.

475
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,089
Well, uh, okay.

476
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:12,094
Loretta...

477
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,485
My name's Mom.

478
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,496
Don't you ever call me
anything else.

479
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:16,898
I'm Mom.

480
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,969
Okay.

481
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,168
Mom.

482
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,300
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I get...

483
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,507
...carried away.

484
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,411
Your eggs are great, by the way.

485
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,005
LILY:
Oh, mama,

486
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,746
that was some bad advice.

487
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,852
Thanks, Lil.

488
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,490
But you know what sucks?

489
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:39,648
When I was
at the top

490
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:40,846
of that lighthouse,

491
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,657
despite everything else...

492
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,489
Wow. It's like traveling
back in time.

493
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,655
Just stop talking.

494
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,104
(sighs)

495
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,428
...it was breathtaking.

496
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,833
And I wasted it.

497
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,925
I mean, how many places
have I ruined forever

498
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,797
by being there
with the wrong girl?

499
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,136
So come back
with the right girl.

500
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,042
I don't know.

501
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,213
I'm starting to think a person
gets a certain allotment

502
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,053
of lighthouses per lifetime.

503
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,378
And I've used all mine up.

504
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,045
NARRATOR:
And that, kids, is the kind
of stupid thing you say

505
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,393
before you've met the person
who hits the reset button

506
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,020
on the world,
who makes everything new again,

507
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,385
who makes it seem ridiculous

508
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,394
that you ever considered
settling,

509
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,756
because not two years later...

510
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,230
Look at that.

511
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,171
It's like traveling
back in time.

512
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,065
That is exactly what I said.
(chuckles)

513
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,907
Why couldn't it have been you
here with me two years ago?

514
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,184
That's probably
for the best.

515
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,183
When you vomit, I vomit.

516
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,515
You know that.

517
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,990
(chuckles)
Well, thanks for being
here with me now.

518
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,460
Thanks for bringing me.

519
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,189
Wow.

520
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:58,928
It is just
bonkers beautiful here.

521
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:02,465
I don't know how you could
improve on a day like this.

522
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,384
Well, I'm gonna try.

523
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,548
Whoa.

524
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,749
Will you...

525
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:21,587
Yes.

526
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,591
You didn't even let me...

527
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:24,563
Yes.

528
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,891
Marry me?

529
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,025
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

530
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,759
Yes, yes... yes.

531
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,267
(chuckles)

532
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:36,599
* Just try,
try a little tenderness *

533
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,106
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got to

534
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,468
* Know how to love her, man

535
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,478
* Take this advice, man

536
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,750
* You got to squeeze her

537
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,148
* Don't tease her.

538
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,459
(inhales deeply)

539
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,488
(exhales)

540
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,427
Son of a bitch!
