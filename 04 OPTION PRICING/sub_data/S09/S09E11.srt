1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,570
NARRATOR: Marshall and Marvin
were taking the bus

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,175
on their way to Long Island
to meet up with us.

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,578
(crying)
There, there,
little Marvin.

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,179
Let no more
tears fall.

5
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:13,851
We're gonna see Mommy
in no time at all.

6
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,081
Hello there. I'm sorry
for all of the noise.

7
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:18,217
It's been a long day
for the Eriksen boys.

8
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,392
Uh... what's with the rhyming?

9
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,761
I'm glad that you ask.

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,729
To get my son
sleeping is no easy task.

11
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,098
A few weeks ago,
the job fell to my wife.

12
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:29,758
And as the poor baby cried out
for dear life,

13
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,997
she read every book,
but all were no use

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,173
until she arrived
at a mother named Goose.

15
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:38,174
Why, Marvin...
MARSHALL:
She noted.

16
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:40,006
...these rhymes
make you tired!

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,080
And ever since then,
all young Marvin's required

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,350
is one book of rhymes,
and to dream land he goes.

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,948
Now, what shall we read?

20
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,419
Oh, crap, I left
his book in the car!

21
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,179
(crying)

22
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,518
That blows.

23
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,222
(crying stops)

24
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,974
Oh, no, what a bummer!

25
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,471
What craptastic luck!

26
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,043
Without Marvin's rhyme book,
this ride's gonna suck!

27
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,042
Does anyone here have
some poetry maybe?

28
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,084
Or any advice?
Yeah!

29
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,779
Don't have a baby!

30
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,710
(laughter)

31
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,646
I guess if I don't want
young Marvin to wake up,

32
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,421
the rhymes will just have
to be ones that I make up.

33
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:26,451
I'll whip up some poetry
in seconds flat!

34
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,493
Oh, I know!

35
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,996
This story's called
Mosby at the Bat!

36
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:42,968
The outlook wasn't brilliant
for poor Ted's romantic life.

37
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:46,973
He was deep into his thirties,
and yet, still he had no wife.

38
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,637
But then, one day
whilst grading papers,

39
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,136
life sent him a whammy.

40
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:52,178
A physics prof named Lisa

41
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,583
who'd just moved here
from Miami.

42
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,784
Professor?

43
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,475
She asked timidly.
He answered:

44
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,087
Call me Ted.
Oh.

45
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,418
I don't want to bother you.

46
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,923
Please, have a seat.
He said.

47
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,464
I'm fairly new to teaching,
and I'm looking for advice.

48
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:07,662
Every night I practice giving
lectures, sometimes twice.

49
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:08,955
But when I teach

50
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:12,126
magnetic force,
I just see eyeballs glazing.

51
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:17,536
I asked around, and people say
your lectures are amazing.

52
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,941
Which is really
saying something,

53
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,972
because, architecture? Yawn.

54
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,938
And Ted thought...

55
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,176
TED: Psh, yeah, 'cause physics
is so interesting.

56
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,553
Go on.

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,120
It's just
that you're so skilled,

58
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,948
and I'm a relative beginner.

59
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,953
If it isn't too much trouble,
can I take you out to dinner?

60
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,557
I'd love to get some pointers,
and I shouldn't keep you late.

61
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,161
What do you say?

62
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,563
What do I say?

63
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,304
Teddy Westside's
got a date!

64
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,230
ALL: Hooray!
MARSHALL: We cheered.

65
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,295
Ted's off the bench!

66
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,803
Our boy's back in the game!

67
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,344
Thank God, it's been
a hundred years

68
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,699
since Mosby scored a dame.

69
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,567
The last time he saw
boobies was

70
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,965
the screen-test
scene in Fame.

71
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,236
The last girl he dated,

72
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,135
I think "Righty" was her name.

73
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,976
Hold it.
Let's not all go crazy

74
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,851
like some wild berzerkers.

75
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,680
What if this is just a business
meal between co-workers?

76
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,716
MARSHALL: Ted thought back
on past failed dates.

77
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,852
Oh, God, that
could be true.

78
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,057
How many times have I come
home to find my balls are blue?

79
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,230
It all depends where Ted and
his new fetching young Floridian

80
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:16,101
are standing in relation
to that puzzling meridian

81
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,099
called
"The International Date Line."

82
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,601
That's right, new theory.

83
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,673
"What's that," you ask?
Nobody did.

84
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,172
I'll now address your query!
The date line

85
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,344
is the border betwixt happiness
and sorrow.

86
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,605
On this side,
you go home tonight.

87
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,613
On this side, home tomorrow.

88
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,176
MARSHALL:
And then, as Barney made some
gestures that were rather rude,

89
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,116
Ted left to go meet Lisa,
in a rather puzzled mood.

90
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,052
Was this a date?

91
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,918
He simply couldn't tell
how he was faring.

92
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,056
Then Lisa showed up.

93
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,561
Ted rejoiced to see
what she was wearing.

94
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:48,955
For girls at business dinners

95
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,056
don't have necklines
that revealing!

96
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:58,406
But then a friendly handshake
gave poor Ted

97
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,969
a sinking feeling.

98
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,048
And so, the night wore on.

99
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,279
And back and forth,
the globe rotated.

100
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:11,946
But still, Ted's curiosity was
never fully sated.

101
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,415
How long could this continue?

102
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,294
He was truly fortune's pawn.

103
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,293
Then Lisa saw the TV.

104
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:18,925
Hey, the Yankees game is on!

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,629
Of baseball...
Ted observed...

106
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,561
...you seem to have some
firsthand knowledge.

107
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,227
To which the lady shrugged
and said...

108
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,765
I played softball in college.

109
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,513
Now the age-old softball
stereotype's just that,

110
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,139
and nothing more.

111
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,643
Yeah!
But as the Yankees got a run,

112
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,835
Ted feared he wouldn't score.

113
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,607
For while the date side
of the line's

114
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,846
the one we all might guess
he's in,

115
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,481
there'll be no joy in Tedville
if our Lisa is a...

116
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,117
Yes! We win!

117
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,462
Then Lisa took a drink
and said...

118
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,518
This may sound kind of random,

119
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:52,187
but there actually is a reason
for my rabid Yankee fandom.

120
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,155
I guess I'll just be
honest here,

121
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,004
though crazy it may seem.

122
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,199
My first week in New York,
I dated someone on the team.

123
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,443
Which player?

124
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,969
I'm not saying.
Please?

125
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,443
What are you, a reporter?

126
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,012
Ted's mind began to race.

127
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,639
The waiter came
to take their order.

128
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,035
As Lisa said...

129
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,006
I might like
the spaghetti marinara.

130
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,554
Poor Ted just wondered
silently...

131
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,150
TED:
Mariano Rivera?

132
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,152
MARSHALL:
And as she said...

133
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,323
I read this place has great
chicken Milano.

134
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,552
All Ted could bring himself
to think was:

135
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,488
TED:
Alfonso Soriano?

136
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,023
I want something hearty.

137
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,327
How about blackened miso cod?

138
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,560
TED:
Is it Joe Girardi?

139
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,025
Holy crap, is it A-Rod?!

140
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,633
Okay, Ted, calm down.

141
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,165
You've got
to get yourself together.

142
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,900
Just smile, be charming,

143
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,065
ooze charisma,
talk about the weather.

144
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,544
For this might be a date,

145
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,812
which means there might be
hanky-panky.

146
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,141
So, dude, be cool, relax,
don't even...

147
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,847
Just tell me which Yankee!

148
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,477
I'd rather not
discuss this here.

149
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,317
But then again, I'd hate...

150
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,391
to let a silly secret ruin
such a lovely date.

151
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:55,862
If there's

152
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,059
an elephant in the room,

153
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,090
why don't we just remove it?

154
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,425
I dated Derek Jeter.

155
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,030
Here's a picture
that'll prove it.

156
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,261
MARSHALL:
As Ted looked
at that cell phone pic,

157
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,026
there were two things
he reckoned.

158
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,025
This definitely was a date,

159
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,567
but there wouldn't be a second.

160
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:11,908
See? It worked.

161
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,909
I said some rhymes,
and out my boy did conk.

162
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,278
Now let's enjoy the ride.

163
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,279
(brakes screech)

164
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,080
Move, jackass!
(honk)

165
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,282
(crying)

166
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,588
Okay, I need a brand-new tale
to silence Marvin's chatter.

167
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,591
I don't know, that last one had
some sketchy subject matter.

168
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,734
Forgive me, but before you got
here, did you smoke a joint?

169
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,101
You don't tell kids a tale
that crass!

170
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,529
NARRATOR:
I guess he had a point.

171
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,765
I know, I said some things
that were,

172
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,900
as you say,
kind of questionable.

173
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,965
The truth is,
children Marvin's age

174
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,774
aren't really
that impressionable.

175
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,206
Do you remember anything
from when you were this small?

176
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,311
Pumpkin picking at age three is
the first thing I recall.

177
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,654
Hmm.
Huh.

178
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,950
He won't remember this.
I guess it's true.

179
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,221
It better be.

180
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,478
Or else we'll end up paying

181
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,117
through the nose
for Marvin's therapy.

182
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,991
Okay, buddy, nice chat,
but I think I need a break.

183
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:01,961
Great idea.

184
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,089
After this story!

185
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,764
Robin Takes the Cake.

186
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,134
Once in an East Side bakery,

187
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,136
your debonair Aunt Robin was
making other customers think,

188
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,139
"Geez, who let this slob in?"

189
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,071
She didn't care about their
stares, or who was looking on.

190
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,508
She'd just broke up with...

191
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,783
Kevin.

192
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,211
No, Gael. Or Scooby?

193
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,148
Don?

194
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:30,983
Now, sometimes,

195
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,318
when it rains it pours,

196
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,652
and sometimes,
it starts snowing,

197
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,157
for as cream filling
hit her shirt...

198
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,589
MAN:
Hey, Robin, how's it going?

199
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,525
'Twas Simon, her ex-boyfriend

200
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,000
from her younger days
in Canada,

201
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,529
but now, he looked
quite different...

202
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,134
Um...

203
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,366
Rhyme.

204
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,970
Uh... thinking. Uh...

205
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,373
I've just been handed
a news flash.

206
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,965
The word "Canada"
is unrhymeable.

207
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,607
It's easier to--
I don't know--

208
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,553
get drunk and try
to climb a bull.

209
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,008
But Canada, damn it,
ask any man on the planet

210
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,347
and watch
their stammerin' stamina

211
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,051
as they clamor and cram it
into the middle of a sentence

212
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,554
for a shot at repentance,

213
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,986
pass the problem on to all
their non-rhyming descendants.

214
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,291
I've never met anyone who could
clean up after Canada.

215
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,133
Except my Uncle Tony
from the Bronx.

216
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,129
He's a janitor.

217
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
(applause)

218
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,027
Show-off.

219
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,037
Simon. Nice to see you.

220
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,169
So, what brings you to New York?

221
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,574
I live here now.
What? Really?

222
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,036
Yeah.
That's great.

223
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,684
Can I get a fork?

224
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,179
MARSHALL:
He'd always been a deadbeat

225
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,910
and your classic hoser phony,

226
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,875
but seeing Simon all cleaned up
hit Robin like a Zamboni.

227
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,045
And as she looked him
up and down,

228
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,394
young Robin felt a tingle.

229
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,218
Had Simon blossomed finally?

230
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,163
And if so, was he single?

231
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,759
So great.

232
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,031
She purred, whilst batting
her eyelashes like a flooze.

233
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,159
Yup, I'm engaged
to Louise Marsh,

234
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,025
and our pad's got a Jacuzz!

235
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,233
The bakery spinned,
the floor dropped out.

236
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,995
The air was thick as syrup.

237
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,004
Poor Robin swooned,
she couldn't breathe,

238
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,866
her eyes began to tear up.

239
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,865
And as she tried
to stammer some excuse

240
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,607
to get away, Simon said:

241
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,082
Our wedding cake is
pretty bitchin', eh?

242
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,511
And so was born the worst idea
poor Robin's ever had.

243
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,047
And on Ted's door
there came a rapping.

244
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,123
I did something bad.

245
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,722
As Robin told her tale,

246
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,864
Ted knew
she'd made a massive boo-boo.

247
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:20,059
For stealing someone's wedding
cake is terribly bad juju.

248
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,563
Robin, I'm beside myself
to see what you've become!

249
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,426
You must return
this cake at once!

250
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,434
I can't!
Why not?

251
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,795
'Cause...

252
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,274
Yum.

253
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,411
Ted gasped, for he had never
seen a brazen act so vicious.

254
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,209
Robin felt remorse, and yet...

255
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,381
Oh, God, this is delicious!

256
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,079
So one piece led to two,
then three, then five, then 17.

257
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:44,223
She savaged that poor cake
like some rapacious wolverine.

258
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,221
Eating, gobbling, munching,
so the frenzied night wore on.

259
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,124
And by the time
your mom arrived,

260
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,056
the cake was halfway gone.

261
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,761
I came as soon as I got word.

262
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,563
So how bad is the damage?

263
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,774
See for yourself the product
of her cake-in-gullet crammage!

264
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,969
Half a cake?

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,430
What have I done?!

266
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,598
The world shall not forgive it!

267
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,267
This day will live in infamy.

268
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,505
I never shall outlive it!

269
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,010
For I have become

270
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,112
the girl that eats her feelings,
don't mistake it.

271
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,275
I think I need to get out
of this chair before I break it.

272
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,985
Nonsense! Hogwash! Balderdash!

273
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,648
Said Mommy, with great fervor.

274
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,457
You can't stop now,
for don't you see?

275
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:26,289
To the uninformed observer,
you're not some sad clichÃ©,

276
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,496
some loser
from a chick-lit story.

277
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,199
You're Robin, and you're half
a wedding cake away from glory!

278
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,043
If you quit now,
then Simon wins,

279
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,109
the tale comes to a stop

280
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,638
at how you saw
an ex, freaked out,

281
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,314
and robbed a pastry shop.

282
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,982
If you have the guts, my dear,

283
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,112
it's time to get empowered

284
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,317
and be remembered for this

285
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,149
sweet behemoth you devoured.

286
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,215
And years from now,

287
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,223
the troubadour will
raise his voice and sing

288
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,156
of the time that Robin
took the cake.

289
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,032
And ate the whole...

290
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,331
damned...

291
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,002
thing.

292
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,471
MARSHALL:
Once more into the breach
she surged,

293
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,069
as Ted and Mommy cheered

294
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,011
and bite by bite the towering
confection disappeared.

295
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,739
Some friends were called
to come and watch.

296
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,244
And no one had to beg.

297
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,575
It soon became a party.

298
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,649
Barney even got a keg.

299
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,748
Forkful after forkful,
Robin guzzled French vanilla

300
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,082
making noises not unlike those
made by a gorilla.

301
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,047
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Come on, Robin,
finish it.

302
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,716
Yeah.
MARSHALL:
Mom's exhortations rang

303
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:32,256
like Apollo coaching Rocky
'gainst a frosted Clubber Lang.

304
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,992
Oh, Rocky IV, my favorite.

305
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,557
No, no, IV is with the Russians.

306
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,395
No, IV's the one
where he talks weird

307
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,030
because of his
concussions.

308
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,366
I think that's all of them.
Hey now,

309
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,200
no need to be discordant.
It's Rocky IV.

310
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,936
No, III.
No, II.

311
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,912
It's really
not important.

312
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,680
At last young Robin raised
the final bite up to her lips

313
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,080
the crowd grew still.

314
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,182
The only sound was Barney

315
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,554
eating chips.
(crunch)

316
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,094
Just one bite left.

317
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,089
Hey, this is like that scene
from Cool Hand Luke. You know,

318
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,122
(Southern accent):
"My boy can eat 50 eggs." Right?

319
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,927
She's gonna puke.

320
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,264
But Robin did not puke.

321
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,395
She ate that bite
and stood up, proud.

322
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,600
(wild cheering, whooping)

323
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,073
Wait. I'm not done yet.

324
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,913
She shouted,
to the startled crowd.

325
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,708
I've bested
this here wedding cake.

326
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,409
I'll gladly wear that crown.

327
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,581
But now that I have

328
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,109
done that task it's time
to wash it down.

329
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,205
For it's been such
an awesome night,

330
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,777
there's just one way
to cap it.

331
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,017
I'm going to drink
this entire keg.

332
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,060
Okay, Barney, tap it.

333
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,188
Oh!
Wow.

334
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,155
Hup.
Ho-o, oh.

335
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,633
MARSHALL:
And now that night's remembered
not for Robin getting dumped

336
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:46,833
but as the night we took her
in to get her stomach pumped.

337
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,067
And look at that,

338
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,472
the little angel's
sleeping soundly, Gus.

339
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,014
Looks like our problems...

340
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,010
Pick a lane!

341
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,341
(honks horn, Marvin cries)

342
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,645
I hate this
stupid bus.

343
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,745
Marvin, I'm afraid
this night is not
much of a winner.

344
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,624
Stuck in traffic,
now we've missed

345
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,493
the whole rehearsal dinner.

346
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,461
I pray that I was right
and that you'll have no memory

347
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,691
of this godforsaken ride
down the congested LIE.

348
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,827
At least we know
one thing for sure:

349
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,534
things can't get worse, I swear.

350
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,125
Adios, truck stop
burrito. Ooh!

351
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,768
Do not go in there.

352
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,942
Okay, one more story,
and I'll try to tell it pretty.

353
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,984
The tale of Barney Stinson,

354
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,039
Player King of New York City.

355
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,389
Once upon a time, we all
went out to get our drink on.

356
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,119
When who should
walk in but a girl

357
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,524
with sweater tight and pink on.

358
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,716
She ordered up a beer.

359
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,527
I think you see where
this is going.

360
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,729
As Barney put it,
oh so eloquently:

361
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,561
Boy-oy-oy-oing.

362
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,997
He rose to go approach this
girl commanding such intrigue

363
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,504
when Mommy interrupted:

364
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,665
Dude, she's way
out of your league.

365
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,574
She's not in Daisy
Dukes, nor squeezed
into a Hooters tee.

366
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,538
And I don't see a
Curves membership

367
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,076
dangling from
her key.

368
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,182
She has no glaring

369
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,553
spray tan, no
unicorn tattoos.

370
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,752
She's sipping
Chardonnay, not pounding
cherry-flavored booze.

371
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,016
Her makeup
isn't running,

372
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,755
she's not playing
with her hair.

373
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,859
There's very little
chance she'll let you
put it anywhere.

374
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,933
Your challenge is accepted, Lil.

375
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,932
There is no girl too pretty,

376
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,904
for I am Barney Stinson,

377
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,203
Player King of New York City.

378
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,665
You can't anoint
yourself the king,

379
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,613
just like that jerk, LeBron.

380
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,869
He left the Cavs
three years ago.

381
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,538
Bro, give it
up, move on.

382
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,676
So why

383
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,180
am I king?
Glad you asked.

384
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,052
We didn't.
Never do.

385
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,180
It's origin
story time.

386
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,875
And trust me,
every word is true.

387
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:48,218
One morning long ago,
I woke up next to a conquest.

388
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,455
So many great things
'bout this girl: her boobs,

389
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,130
her rack, her chest.

390
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,930
She had a thirst for action,

391
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:57,032
and young Barney
was a-quenchin' it.

392
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,234
Is this important
to the story?

393
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,125
No, just thought
I'd mention it.

394
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,467
As I departed, having bid
this busty babe buh-bye,

395
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,443
I stopped and looked around,
and wondered:

396
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,072
Where the hell am I?

397
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,437
The sign read 22nd Street,
and my concern decreased

398
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,606
until a cold wind
blew a branch aside,

399
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,945
revealing: "East."

400
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,281
The East Side. No.

401
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,616
Wh-What have I done?

402
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,990
I stammered with chagrin.

403
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,889
Just then a black sedan
pulled up...

404
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,460
You Barney?
Yeah.

405
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,089
Get in.
(sighs)

406
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,264
Is any of this true?

407
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,432
Of course. Now,
hang on to your "chayers."

408
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,961
For that day
I was called before...

409
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,428
the High Council of Players.

410
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,966
Gentlemen, for your attendance
here, our deepest thanks.

411
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:41,014
I'm sad to say, this council
has a poacher in its ranks.

412
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,611
For Barney here

413
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,842
picked up a girl
outside his territory.

414
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,847
The East Side

415
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,448
is Tuxedo Charlie's turf.

416
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,620
He's mad.

417
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,148
True story.

418
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,593
The Agreement of 2004
quite clearly did define

419
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,660
Fifth Avenue to be our hunting
grounds' dividing line.

420
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,089
Your West Side college girls are
not the slip I park my boat in.

421
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,498
So you should know

422
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,429
my East Side debutantes
are quite verboten.

423
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,536
(sighs) Members
of the council...

424
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,198
Bros... nobody wants a war.

425
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,368
Of course I've not
forgotten the agreement of '04.

426
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,137
What can I say? A bonehead move.

427
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,006
Defend it?
I'm not able.

428
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,375
But, bros, have I not been a bro

429
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,153
to each bro at this table?

430
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,152
My friend from Brooklyn,
Pickle Jar Bob,

431
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,124
will give some validation.

432
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,193
Remember that
young tourist

433
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,860
who was looking
for Penn Station?

434
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,629
She'd just come in from Boston,
had a wicked good-in-bed look.

435
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,629
I gave her bad directions
and she ended up in Red Hook.

436
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,503
Shut up, Barney.
Whoa, Bronx Donnie,

437
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,171
let's not get excited.

438
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,540
Tuxedo Charlie's not the only
one here who's been slighted.

439
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,010
You told her you were Jeter
in your quest to lie upon her.

440
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,540
Impersonating Yankees
is my thing.

441
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,176
Have you no honor?

442
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,211
Gentlemen, please,
let's not blow

443
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,076
this dÃ©tente
to smithereens.

444
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,475
Council recognizes Captain Bill,

445
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,047
our bro from Queens.

446
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,016
Thank you.

447
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,393
You all know me,

448
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,021
and you all
respect my game.

449
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,591
I dress up like a pilot
and meet girls in baggage claim.

450
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,926
And on my long-ass subway ride
from 61st and Woodside,

451
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,072
I came up with a plan to keep
you on each other's good side.

452
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,400
Barney,
you have wronged these two.

453
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,865
So, for the game

454
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,013
they're losing,
you now must grant them each

455
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,508
a West Side hottie
of their choosing.

456
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,581
You're kidding.

457
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,939
That's the settlement?

458
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,106
Come on, that's rather silly.
Gentlemen,

459
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,076
what say you?

460
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:28,084
I want Robin.

461
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,075
I want Lily.

462
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,946
Please. Bronx Donnie?

463
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,353
No chance he could
get me in the sack.

464
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,216
Tell that Mafioso I know
something he can whack.

465
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,786
Ladies, don't
you worry,

466
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,964
your fair legs can
all stay closed.

467
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,132
'Cause luckily
they took

468
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:44,101
the counteroffer
I proposed.

469
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,401
Well, gentlemen,

470
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,232
it seems there's nothing
I can say to sway you.

471
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,697
Charlie, Donnie,

472
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,465
say no more,
I gladly will repay you.

473
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,813
Carlotta, some champagne.

474
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:56,409
Let's toast before
we all adjourn.

475
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,905
To boobies.

476
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,815
Oh, and B-T-dub,

477
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,550
y'all just drank poison.

478
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,745
Ha-burn.

479
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,186
(gags)

480
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,603
(maniacal laugh)

481
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,173
And thus, my friends,
I have become,

482
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,306
through methods somewhat gory

483
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,111
the Player King
of New York City.

484
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,084
Boom.

485
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,351
The end.

486
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,821
True story.

487
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,248
Well, that was great.

488
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,154
Your little story
tickled all our ribs.

489
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,086
But one mistake
you made, sir,

490
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,490
was forgetting
to call dibs.

491
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:44,123
(gasps)

492
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,587
BARNEY:
No! Not fair.

493
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,325
But I'm the king.

494
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,960
And such a
better dresser.
TED: Sorry, dude,

495
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,596
but that's revenge

496
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,171
for Lisa the professor.
(chuckles)

497
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,341
(giggles)

498
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,968
Let's have
another round.

499
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,143
Yes.
MARSHALL:
Your mommy said.

500
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,941
And so we had one.

501
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,772
The night wore on,
and I must say,

502
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,808
it wasn't a half bad one.

503
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,113
What memories.
Our young and happy hearts

504
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,945
were hot as fire.

505
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,821
Feels like a lifetime
since those days.

506
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,660
(loud bump)
BUS DRIVER:
Sorry, folks,

507
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,058
flat tire.

508
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,629
(Marvin cries)
Oh, come on.

509
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,988
Now I'm never gonna
make it to Nantucket.

510
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,097
(Marvin continues wailing)

511
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:29,071
(explosions)

512
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,901
Oh, look a
fireworks display.

513
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,337
Some rockets
red glare action.

514
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,712
Thank God.

515
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,210
Thought my glaucoma drops
were causing a reaction.

516
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:41,314
Marvin, I'm so sorry this
whole journey's been a bummer.

517
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:46,548
Soon you'll be right back in
Mommy's arms, as warm as summer.

518
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:50,016
But sadly while your troubles
stop once we get to the inn

519
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,386
the moment we arrive
is when my troubles will begin.

520
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,926
Sometimes daddies screw up,

521
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,772
sometimes mommies get upset.

522
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,198
I really hope this weekend
is a memory you'll forget.

523
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:05,905
So look up at those fireworks,
enjoy the falling embers...

524
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,408
NARRATOR:
And that, kids,
is the very first thing

525
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,612
your cousin
Marvin remembers.

526
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,919
Gentlemen and ladies,
it'll be an hour or so...

527
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,891
(groans)
before the truck
gets here to give our

528
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,560
broken bus a tow.

529
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:26,129
So in the meantime I suggest
we all get nice and cozy.

530
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,658
We're gonna be here
for a while.

531
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,867
Uh, ring-around-the-rosy?

532
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,899
Yeah!

533
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:38,044
How far do you suppose it is
to the Farhampton Inn?

534
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,040
I'd say about five miles away.

535
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,912
Oh, no.

536
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,481
What's with the grin?

537
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,450
NARRATOR:
Then Marshall
looked up heavenward,

538
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,478
and swore by night's first star

539
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,884
five simple words
he'd soon regret:

540
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,446
I can walk that far.

541
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,257
