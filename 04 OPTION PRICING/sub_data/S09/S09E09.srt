1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,810
TED: Your mom's not coming
to the wedding?

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,408
Okay, seriously,
I-I need to stop crying

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,880
Does anyone know how
to turn this off?

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,379
Is there, like, a button
or something?

5
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,081
Want me to feel
around for it?

6
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,853
It's probably
somewhere on your back.

7
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,151
Stop it.
What? I'm trying
to cheer you up.

8
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:18,194
I don't think that's possible
at this point.

9
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,719
Challenge accepted!

10
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,023
No, Barney,

11
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:24,255
I just need to get myself
to stop crying, that's all.

12
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,592
Boogity-boo!

13
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,696
Lily, what the hell?!
It's not the hiccups.

14
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,228
I was just going on a hunch.

15
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,803
(hiccups)
And now I have the hiccups.

16
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,748
Look, guys, just, seriously,
don't worry about me, okay?

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,580
Just let me deal
with this on my own.

18
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:51,016
I'm afraid that's
not possible, Robin.

19
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,291
Once I've accepted a challenge,
it cannot be unaccepted.

20
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:57,792
I will not rest
until the job is done.

21
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:58,955
Oh, is that so?

22
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:02,702
Then where are our diapers
and Samosas?

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,230
Aha!

24
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,795
NARRATOR: Diapers and Samosas.
Oh, that's about something

25
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,944
that happened six months
earlier in the fall of 2012.

26
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,240
BOTH:
Major craving for a mojito.

27
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,773
Oh, God, we're back

28
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,207
to your stupid little
private joke again?

29
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:19,054
Are you guys really still doing
this seven years later?

30
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,419
It's so annoying. Just stop it.

31
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,919
Private joke again?

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,120
Are you guys really still
doing this seven years later?

33
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,453
It's so annoying.
Just stop it.

34
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,217
You don't salute a private!

35
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,156
I'll be right back.
All right.

36
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,731
Lily, are you playing
footsie with me?

37
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,130
What?

38
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,462
Oh, no, no. I was just feeling
around for your shin.

39
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:37,997
My shin? Why would you...?

40
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,731
Ow! Why'd you do that?

41
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,097
To remind you what pain is.

42
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:44,805
You keep it up with all the
cutesy-tootsy stuff with Robin,

43
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,938
gonna be a whole lot more
where that came from.

44
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,905
Lily, you have nothing
to worry about.

45
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,353
I better not.
You and Robin are platonic.

46
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,320
Please.
Ted and Robin
are not platonic.

47
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,489
Just like me and Robin
are not platonic.

48
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:01,258
Just like no two single
people in the world
are ever platonic.

49
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,119
Symposium: two people
are only platonic if

50
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:07,928
in the next 20 minutes
there is no chance
of them hooking up.

51
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:12,331
Truth is, I only know
of one genuinely platonic
relationship.

52
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,366
You and me.

53
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,541
Don't make me laugh, Lily.

54
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,168
You want to hit this
so hard.

55
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:20,114
Seriously, she's playing
footsies with me as I... Ow!

56
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,710
No, I'm talking
about Marshall and Robin.

57
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,484
NARRATOR:
Marshall and Robin wouldn't
hook up even if this happened:

58
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,124
Marshall, Robin!

59
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,118
If you guys don't full-on
make out in the next 20 minutes,

60
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,491
they're gonna blow me up
and everyone in this bar!

61
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,691
My God, no!
Anyone but Robin.

62
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,493
I really don't want
to do this!

63
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,425
Guys, we have no time!
Just do it!

64
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,471
I'm sorry, baby,
I just, I can't do it.

65
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,144
Aw...

66
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,311
(explosion)

67
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,880
And the only survivor
was me

68
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,008
because I was upstairs
banging Ted's mom.

69
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,584
What? Get that blond girl's
phone number?

70
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,153
Challenge accepted.

71
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,581
(phone rings)

72
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,047
Unknown caller, stop calling me.

73
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,187
Are you gonna answer it?

74
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,062
Yeah, 'cause it's 1994

75
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,659
and I'm gonna pick up a phone

76
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,931
without knowing who's on
the other end.

77
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,159
I should get going.

78
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,234
Ted...

79
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:17,063
Lily, by every definition
of the word platonic,

80
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,067
including Barney's fake one,
I can say

81
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,369
with total certainty...

82
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,771
that Brussels sprouts

83
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,702
are the comeback vegetable
of the 21st century.

84
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:24,867
Well, see you guys later.

85
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,665
Bye.

86
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,107
Challenge completed.

87
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,013
I'm sorry. I-I missed
the first half of this.

88
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,106
Um, why is picking up

89
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,247
a drunk chick sitting alone
and rubbing a tan line

90
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:40,415
on her finger where a wedding
ring used to be, a challenge?

91
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,224
Because I said
challenge accepted.

92
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,257
See? That's your problem,
Barney.

93
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:48,263
You only accept challenges
you came up with.

94
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:51,196
Just once,
I'd like to see you accept

95
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,431
someone else's challenge.

96
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,036
Challenge acc...
Wait-- what's the challenge?

97
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,808
Interesting. An opportunity rife
with possibilities.

98
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,069
We need to find something

99
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,107
with just the right amount
of poetic...

100
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,082
Get a girl's number
while talking like a dolphin!

101
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,982
That works.

102
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,292
(chittering like a dolphin)

103
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,063
Open your eyes, ref!
That's not a pregnant lady!

104
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,096
It's a basketball
under his shirt!

105
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,632
Blow the freakin'
whistle!

106
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,338
Anyways, Barney's right;

107
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,440
I would absolutely
let the bar blow up.

108
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,142
But you'd die, and
Lily would die, too.

109
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,744
Yeah, but then we could
haunt the bar for eternity

110
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,807
like we always planned.
Anyways, Robin's your girl.

111
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,646
Why do we keep
coming back to this?

112
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,921
It's fun. Tickets are cheap.
Gets us out of the house.

113
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,050
No, me and Robin.

114
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,993
Because Robin told me that
she's still in love with you.

115
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,933
Are you serious?
Robin told you that she's

116
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,025
still in love with me?

117
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,526
No, I just made that up.

118
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:02,768
But it was worth it
because I can tell

119
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,773
by that look on your face
that you still have
feelings for Robin.

120
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,436
Okay, ball is sitting
on the basket!

121
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:10,205
That's not only illegal,
it's unsafe!

122
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,783
Come on, Gens, D up!

123
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,983
It's this monastery
in Connecticut out
in the woods,

124
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,946
and the nuns there,
they make this
gourmet cheese.

125
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,116
It's just amazing.

126
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,023
(chittering)

127
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,015
Wow, was that
three glasses of wine?

128
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,557
Where does the time go

129
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,803
(chitters)

130
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,728
(chuckles) Look, I know
that you need

131
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,063
to get back
to your studies.

132
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,728
Maybe we could get together
some other time?

133
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,397
(clicking, chittering)

134
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,567
No! Not possible!

135
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,365
It was the performance
of a lifetime.

136
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,877
Man, if I'd have hung around
for a few more minutes,

137
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:42,979
I probably could have

138
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,080
gotten her
to touch my blowhole.
Give me that.

139
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,352
(distant phone rings)

140
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,180
Hello?

141
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,075
Hi, did you just give
your phone number to a guy

142
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,077
who was squeaking
like a dolphin?

143
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,188
(chuckles)
Yeah.

144
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,320
Honey, listen to me.

145
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,664
I need you to take
a year, a full year

146
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,190
and just be
celibate, okay?

147
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,155
No boys.

148
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,692
One year.

149
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,658
I think you know
I'm right about this.

150
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,996
You're right.

151
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,371
Yeah.

152
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,899
That was heartbreaking

153
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,274
And pants-breaking
Boing-oing-oing!

154
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,002
All right, next challenge.

155
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,068
Oh, this is an all-night thing?

156
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:17,076
Okay, um, pick up a girl...

157
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,010
wearing a garbage bag.

158
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,216
(scoffs)
I'd be "Glad" to.

159
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,086
Just hope she's not too "Hefty."

160
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:29,418
And those are all of the brands
of trash bags I can think of.

161
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:30,617
I'm not done.

162
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:34,798
You also can't use
the letter "E."

163
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,400
Challng... accptd-d.

164
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,640
You're single,
she's single,

165
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,112
It's time to do this.

166
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,079
You're only saying this
because you bet Lily

167
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,938
that Robin and I would
end up together,

168
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,277
and you want
that five bucks.

169
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,081
I need that five bucks, Ted.

170
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,783
But more importantly,
I need you to be happy.

171
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,816
Marshall, we're platonic.

172
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,151
But you're not platonic!

173
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:02,086
You are 20 short minutes away
from happily ever after.

174
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,322
I mean, if you left
right now.

175
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,759
Hey.

176
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,667
I have loved you from
the moment we met.

177
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,129
I know we're meant
to be together.

178
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,466
I don't want to waste
another second without you.

179
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:15,472
Let's give it
another shot.

180
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,073
Okay!

181
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,014
No!
(buzzer sounds)

182
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,169
Pay up, baby.
Pay up.

183
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,178
TED:
Oh, yes!

184
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,350
* Sweet, sweet five bucks,
you soon will be mine *

185
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,849
* Even though Lily
and I share bank accounts *

186
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,592
* You're already mine
to begin with. * Sorry.

187
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:35,319
And you and Robin get
a lifetime of happiness,
so there's that.

188
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,515
But you better hurry up

189
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,127
before some other guy
snatches her up.

190
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,028
Really? And who's
my competition?

191
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,870
Okay, don't use the letter "E."
Don't use the letter "E."

192
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,096
Hey.

193
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,174
Damn it.

194
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,842
Hi. I... am...

195
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,783
Barney. Damn it!

196
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,978
There's an E
in my name!

197
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,179
Hi. My word for...

198
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,583
this guy is Barno.

199
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:09,994
Barno. You look...

200
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,663
not ugly.

201
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:12,562
(chuckles)

202
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,963
Your... dial thing...

203
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:15,995
is what?

204
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,729
Do you want
to just go back to my place?

205
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,426
Yes. Damn it!

206
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,972
I want to buy you a drink.

207
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:28,584
But first, what do I call you?

208
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,179
Elaine Edelstein.

209
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,975
How about I just call you...

210
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,346
tomorrow?

211
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,854
Your digits, m'lady?

212
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,419
Seriously, guys,

213
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,386
you're gonna have
to try harder than that.

214
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,455
Challenge accepted.

215
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,159
Excuse me, hi.

216
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,667
I'm Ryan Gosling's
personal assistant.

217
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,070
He saw you
as you were walking in,

218
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:58,172
and he sent me over
to tell you to wait here.

219
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,765
Be cool. This is real, okay?

220
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:03,277
But listen, Ryan is super shy.

221
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,550
Aw...
I know.

222
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,449
Which means that if he comes in
here and he sees you talking

223
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,121
to some other guy, he's gonna
turn right around and leave.

224
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,749
Nod if you understand.

225
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,892
Redhead at the bar.

226
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,163
Challenge accepted.

227
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,961
Hey, there.
Get away from me!

228
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,264
It's like you're trying
to lose, Eddie!

229
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,766
Hey, Eddie,
last time I saw

230
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,468
this many turnovers
was at a bakery.
Oh!

231
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,441
So are you doing
this or what?
No.

232
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,739
And for the record,
if I were gonna do it,

233
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,612
I wouldn't just be, like,
"Hey, we should get
back together."

234
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:35,812
Amateur hour.

235
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,653
Here's how you do it.

236
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,420
Excuse me. Okay, sorry.

237
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,850
(text alert sounds)
Sorry.

238
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:46,953
Huh.

239
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,757
Stop, thief!

240
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,766
MARSHALL:
The blue French horn,
it's so romantic!

241
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,099
Oh, my God, do you know
who you are?!

242
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,974
You're Nicholas Sparks!

243
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,073
Hey, everybody, we got
a, uh, celebrity

244
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,076
in the crowd over here.
We got, uh, Nicholas Sparks!

245
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,639
You didn't let me finish.

246
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,648
Ted, listen...

247
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,910
(buzzer sounds)

248
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,847
I can do without reliving that.

249
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,153
Are you completely blind?

250
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:18,845
What?

251
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,646
Open your eyes, ref!

252
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,288
The ball hasn't touched
the ground in seven minutes!

253
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,933
Hey, ref, check
your voicemail!

254
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,828
I think you've missed
a few calls!

255
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,830
(scoffs)

256
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:32,132
Are you completely blind?!

257
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,295
Wait-- me or...?

258
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,973
You, Ted!

259
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,302
Robin has changed her mind.

260
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,006
No, Robin doesn't change
her mind.

261
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,608
Except that she does.

262
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,339
Remember how she
used to claim to hate
white guy funk bands?

263
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,535
And yet, at the farewell
performance of my band,

264
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,107
"The Funk, the Whole Funk
and Nothing but the Funk,"

265
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,177
there's Robin
rhythmically nodding her head

266
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,886
and shouting out a request
for "Give Up the Funk."

267
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,119
I think she was nodding her head
in response to my question,

268
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,185
"Do you want
to leave soon?"

269
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,964
And she was
legitimately suggesting

270
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,262
that you give up the funk.

271
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,999
Can we just drop this?
I have moved on.

272
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,731
Well, except that you haven't.

273
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,066
You didn't just come up with
this blue French horn thing.

274
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,541
You've thought about this.

275
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,969
EDDIE:
Mr. Sparks?

276
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,314
I loved The Notebook.

277
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,139
Eddie, you're down by 80.

278
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,005
Will you watch the game?

279
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,352
Do not come any closer!

280
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,550
I swear to God I will kill you.

281
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,181
It's cool.
I'm not gonna come any closer.

282
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,987
You're looking at the door,
you're waiting for someone.

283
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,220
Someone important,
someone who will fill

284
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,156
an empty space in your life.

285
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,091
A movie star?

286
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,426
Ah-huh.

287
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,831
But which one?

288
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,374
Clooney,

289
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,898
DiCaprio, Zabka...?

290
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,695
No...

291
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,067
I'm gonna go with Ryan...

292
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,776
Reyn...

293
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,179
Phil-Phillip...

294
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,750
Seacr... Gosling...

295
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,450
Ryan Gosling!

296
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,951
Yes, I'm waiting
for Ryan Gosling, okay?

297
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,223
Now, leave me alone.

298
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,834
You passed my test, girl.

299
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,862
Ryan?
ROBIN: No.

300
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,028
Just... no.

301
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,366
I told her I'm a method actor.

302
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,041
And I had to get plastic surgery

303
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,109
for an upcoming role
where I play a man

304
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,908
much more handsome than myself.

305
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,040
Congratulations, you win.

306
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,535
Win? No, I don't want to win.

307
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,046
I want to keep playing.
More challenges.

308
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,079
Fine, you want
another challenge?

309
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,224
More challenges,
more challenges.

310
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,319
Fine, here's your challenge.

311
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,950
Go down to the pharmacy
and buy some diapers.

312
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,986
And, uh, get me a Samosa
from the Indian place.

313
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,963
Sounds like an errand.

314
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,091
While picking up a girl.

315
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,827
Challenge accepted!

316
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,003
Come on!

317
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,001
Whatever happened to the guy

318
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,072
who wasn't afraid to charge

319
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,399
headlong into the unknown?

320
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,974
What unknown?

321
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,242
Sure, eight years ago

322
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,840
when I stole
that blue French horn, yeah.

323
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,172
That was the unknown.

324
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,506
But now? I mean, how many times
have we been here?

325
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,512
I know exactly
what's gonna happen.

326
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,154
You know who else knew exactly
what was gonna happen, Ted?

327
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,120
The Washington Generals
on January 5, 1971.

328
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,690
They knew they were gonna lose,
but they went in there anyway,

329
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,018
and then gave it
their best shot.

330
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,024
And they won that game, Ted!

331
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,086
For one reason
and for one reason only.

332
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,364
A scoring error and the fact
that Curly Neal had the flu?

333
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,463
Perseverance.

334
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,595
It was the only win
in Generals history,

335
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,130
but that's all you need.

336
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,666
Just one win.

337
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,670
(cell phone ringing)

338
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,041
I'm gonna go
grab us some beers.

339
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,172
(clicks tongue)

340
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,937
Hi, I don't know who this is
or what you're trying to sell,

341
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,507
but you are disturbing me
during the Globetrotters.

342
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,175
Hello, Ted,
it's Hammond Druthers.

343
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,746
Target acquired.

344
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,467
I'm recruiting volunteers

345
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,072
for the starving puppy orphanage
where I work.

346
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,544
For free.

347
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,241
So, if you wouldn't mind just
writing your number down

348
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,045
on this signup sheet...?

349
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,678
Listen, I appreciate
that you feel

350
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,175
like you need my number.

351
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,177
Um.

352
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,418
Maybe it's because
you're really sad

353
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,063
about something
and this is your way

354
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,858
of feeling better
about yourself.

355
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,990
But...

356
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,755
since I have a boyfriend,
and I'm pretty sure

357
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,503
I heard you call me a target
earlier over there,

358
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,000
Wha...?
I'm gonna go ahead

359
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,032
and not give you my number.

360
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,336
I'm gonna give you
something even better.

361
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,938
Wow, right to the chase.

362
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,440
Meet you in aisle six.

363
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,211
I'm gonna give you this.
Okay.

364
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,941
It's gonna be okay.

365
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,207
You're a good guy.

366
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,375
You will get through this.

367
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,046
Uh, okay.

368
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,015
Weirdo alert.

369
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,264
(chuckles)

370
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,758
(scoffs)

371
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,960
Have you met...?

372
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,363
(groans)

373
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,664
Excuse me.

374
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,099
What do you mean "sad"?

375
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,444
HAMMOND DRUTHERS:
Ted?

376
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,239
I'm calling you
from Chicago, Illinois

377
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,071
where I'm a key player

378
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,306
in a very successful
architectural firm.

379
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,741
Oh, yeah, I read about that.

380
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,136
All right,
about what you read...

381
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,108
You built
that big concave glass tower.

382
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,946
And it melted a few buildings
across the street.

383
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,152
Yes, fine, but come on.

384
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,654
What architect has made
a major design flaw

385
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,716
that raised the temperature
of the city aquarium

386
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,824
to 190 degrees

387
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,155
and killed thousands
of very rare fish?

388
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:28,102
That's the past, Ted.
I'm looking forward.

389
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,058
I want you on my team.

390
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,067
And I won't take no
for an answer.

391
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:35,139
No.
I don't think you heard me, Ted.

392
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,138
No.
Come on, Ted!

393
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,640
Please?

394
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,971
They're gonna give me
a parking spot if you say yes.

395
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,108
Do I get a parking spot?
Well, we can go tandem.

396
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,783
No.
Every other week then?

397
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,451
No.
You know, Chicago's
more of a walking town.

398
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,120
No.
All right!

399
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,119
You can have the parking spot.

400
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:51,991
So, that's a yes?

401
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,189
Mm, no.
Look, Ted.

402
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,821
I can make your life
very difficult.

403
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,187
How?
How?!

404
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,664
I will call you a lot.

405
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,867
I will Tweet at you like crazy.

406
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,169
I will live
on your Facebook wall!

407
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,173
We're not Facebook friends.

408
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,674
Yeah, what's going on with that?

409
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,375
It's been pending, like,
for eight months now.

410
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,048
Look, Ted, you're a...

411
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,948
a very hot commodity.

412
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,620
Everybody loves the GNB Tower.

413
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,451
And how it hasn't blinded
any pilots

414
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,516
on final approach into O'Hare.

415
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:29,455
(laughs)

416
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,959
And I-I may have told

417
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,660
the partners here
that you and I are

418
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,062
very, very good friends.

419
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,464
So, please, just say
that you'll think about it.

420
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,696
Fine.

421
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,570
I'll think about it.

422
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,999
Druthers shoots, he scores!

423
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:45,835
Sad? Lady, I got 14 girls'
numbers in the last hour.

424
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,012
And this was an off night.
(chuckles)

425
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,141
What can I possibly
be sad about?

426
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,777
I think you were in love
and you messed it up.

427
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,047
And every moment of your life
since then

428
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,193
has been spent trying to stay
busy enough to ignore that fact.

429
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,019
NARRATOR:
And that's how Barney met
your mother.

430
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,064
Well, the Generals lost.

431
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,334
What a nail biter--
the whole fourth quarter

432
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,901
my heart was in my throat.

433
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,099
What was the final?

434
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,171
216 to 12.

435
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,529
Nobody talk to me right
now, I can't even...

436
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,599
The strangest thing
happened at the game.

437
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,507
I got a phone call
from an unknown number.

438
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,069
And when I answered I...

439
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,075
You're eating olives.

440
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,680
Yup.

441
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,681
Do you want these?

442
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,012
I hate olives.

443
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,846
I... thought you hate olives.

444
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,281
(laughs)
I guess I changed my mind.

445
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,588
(phone ringing)

446
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,720
Ah!

447
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,224
Hello, partner!

448
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,056
Boy, that just sounds right,
doesn't it?

449
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,532
Yeah, actually, Mr. Druthers.

450
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,201
My answer is no.

451
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,100
What? No, Ted, come on!

452
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:50,043
I'm sorry, I still have things
to do here in New York.

453
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,069
I am going to build
a tower of glass

454
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,235
and melt you with it!

455
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,044
No, you won't.
No, I won't, but know this.

456
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,446
After today

457
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,108
this offer

458
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,447
is gone forever.

459
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,321
When I hang up this phone,
you and I are done.

460
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,091
The door is closed!
Okay.

461
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,260
The door's always open, Ted.

462
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,918
If you change your mind,
just call me back, okay?

463
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,986
Bye.

464
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,064
I think he's coming around.

465
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,834
We tried dating a while back

466
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,933
and it was a disaster.

467
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,265
But I-I always regret giving up.

468
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,601
It just ended so quickly.

469
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,666
(quiet laugh)

470
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,114
What about you?

471
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,180
You and your boyfriend
gonna go the distance?

472
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,939
I don't know.

473
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:34,177
I think maybe I still
haven't met the right guy.

474
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,184
Hmm.

475
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,486
I wonder if I know someone
to set you up with.

476
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,658
Drawing a blank.

477
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,261
Are you gonna
go get this girl?

478
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,363
Or what?

479
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,804
I don't know.

480
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,758
I'm kind of
at my peak right now.

481
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,497
I don't know if I can
just walk away from the game.

482
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,143
Do you want to keep playing
or do you want to win?

483
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,212
I want to win.

484
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,180
What am I doing?

485
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,312
In less than 20 minutes,
Robin and I could be...

486
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,647
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

487
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,051
It's gonna take a lot more
than 20 minutes.

488
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,192
This is gonna take everything
you have got.

489
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,820
This is gonna take all of your
time, all of your attention.

490
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,355
All of your resources.

491
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,160
This is the big one.

492
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,733
Diaper man.

493
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,332
You got to do it right.

494
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,574
Can't be messing around,

495
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,568
picking up girls in drug stores.

496
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,970
* It's only time

497
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,401
You got work to do.

498
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,137
* It's only time *

499
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,582
* It's only time

500
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:41,079
* What could stop...

501
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,223
We're not platonic.

502
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,750
Platon-ish, maybe.

503
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:45,894
If that's even a word.

504
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,418
But not platonic.

505
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,864
* It's only time...

506
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,919
I mean, there's
something between us.

507
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,558
And there always will be.

508
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,029
* If rain won't...

509
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,165
If this was eight years ago,

510
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
I'd be jumping
into a cab right now

511
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,735
to go steal
that blue French horn.

512
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,171
Well, why don't you?

513
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,405
I don't know.

514
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,240
Just doesn't seem to work
that way anymore.

515
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,507
I used to be in such a hurry
all the time, you know?

516
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,006
Everything was so urgent.

517
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,217
Now, I just, I don't know,
I figure...

518
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,791
it's gonna happen, it'll happen
when it happens.

519
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,020
I'm not going anywhere,
she's not going anywhere.

520
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,356
What's the rush, right?

521
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,362
* And swim your sea *

522
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,204
* And swim

523
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,099
* Your sea

524
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,098
* Marry me

525
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,967
I have no idea
who that girl was.

526
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,436
But she set me straight.

527
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:46,375
After that, I had one challenge
and one challenge only.

528
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,253
Get Robin Scherbatsky

529
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,821
to fall in love with me.

530
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,790
Challenge completed.

531
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:58,221
* Why would I stop loving you
a hundred years from now? *

532
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,470
