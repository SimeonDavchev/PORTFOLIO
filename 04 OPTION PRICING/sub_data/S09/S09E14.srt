1
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:07,212
("O Fortuna" playing)

2
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,912
("O Fortuna" playing)

3
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,880
NARRATOR:
Oh, sorry, kids.

4
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,249
I forgot to mention
there's a bit of a backstory

5
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,048
to this particular slap.

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,250
Oh, man.

7
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,881
Oh.

8
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,086
At least it landed
on the mustard stain.

9
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,749
Don't bother.
That suit is a stain.

10
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,717
A stain on the very institution
of suits.

11
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,257
You know what tie goes
with that suit?

12
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,392
The tie at the top
of a Hefty bag.

13
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,628
A suit like that

14
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,032
only needs one button...
self-destruct.

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,204
Hey, I bought him
that suit.

16
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,803
Where? Barfs Brothers?

17
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,441
Men's Outhouse?

18
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,610
Giorgio Arms...
Are-Not-the-Same-Lengthy?

19
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:15,937
That suit is a slap in the face
to all suits everywhere.

20
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,246
A slap in the face.

21
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,249
Uh, yes, Barney.

22
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,881
There's something I need to
tell you about the next slap

23
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,216
that you're going to receive.

24
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:25,292
You see,

25
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,119
I want this slap to be

26
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:30,255
as painful as
humanly possible.

27
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,131
BOTH: Sure.
Sure.
Okay, okay.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,990
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

29
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,467
Yes, you won a slap bet
with me seven years ago.

30
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:38,898
And, yes, over the years,

31
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,072
you got in some great slaps.

32
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,741
Some great slaps.

33
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,811
But here's the problem.

34
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,938
You've tormented me so much

35
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,584
that I am now immune to it.

36
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,679
Hmm.
It's as if

37
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,610
my face, my psyche, my soul

38
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,846
were covered
in that numbing cream

39
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:57,152
we all put on our deals
so that we can go all night.

40
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,315
Am I right, fellas?

41
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:03,017
Okay, we'll all just pretend
like we've never done that.

42
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,426
Just like we've never sat on our
left hand until it fell asleep

43
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,460
and then used it
for an away gamer.

44
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,327
Okay.

45
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,374
We'll all pretend

46
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,469
like we've never done that.

47
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,470
Just like we've all never taken

48
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,201
two live jumper cables...

49
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,636
Please stop.

50
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,310
Barney, I'm well-aware
that you've developed

51
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,439
a resistance to all
of my old tricks,

52
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,544
which is why I sought
out special training.

53
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,807
Hi, hey, I'm sure you get
this question all the time.

54
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,877
But is there a special class
where I just learn slapping?

55
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,547
We teach kung fu here.

56
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,385
Right, see,
the thing is, I don't need

57
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,891
to learn anything about kicking.

58
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:35,662
You know?

59
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,429
Because, uh...

60
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:39,892
So, yeah.

61
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,957
I'm good there.

62
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,795
Um, what I really need
to learn is slapping.

63
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,231
I need someone to teach me
how to slap my friend

64
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,067
just like really hard
right in his stupid face.

65
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,642
Can you teach me that?

66
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,541
Kung fu is an ancient
and honorable martial art.

67
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,844
It must be learned
with great devotion

68
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,545
and respect.

69
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,809
So, where are we on this
whole slapping thing?

70
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,278
Yes, no, maybe...?
Get out.

71
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,818
Psst.

72
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,663
I know what you seek.

73
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,888
You seek to learn

74
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,722
the Slap of a Thousand

75
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,588
Exploding Suns.

76
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,926
Yes, that's totally
a thing I've heard of.

77
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,362
Can you teach me?

78
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,427
No, but I know who can.

79
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:20,366
Can you take me
to this great master?

80
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,871
I have much gold.

81
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:25,242
It is not one great master
you seek but three.

82
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:26,543
They will teach you

83
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:30,044
the three mighty virtues
of slapistry.

84
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,037
Speed.

85
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,605
Strength.

86
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,047
And accuracy.

87
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,294
Put these
three virtues together,

88
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,960
and only then
will you have mastered

89
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,119
the Slap of a Million

90
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,527
Exploding Suns.

91
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,361
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but a second ago,

92
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:52,097
wasn't it the Slap
of a Thousand Exploding Suns?

93
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,372
Pretty sure I said
a million, guys?
I heard a million.

94
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:55,702
He said a million.
One million.

95
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,906
MARSHALL:
So I went to Shanghai...

96
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,068
You didn't go to Shanghai.

97
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,106
I went to Shanghai.

98
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,140
When did you go to Shanghai?

99
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,144
Last year I went
to Shanghai.

100
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,075
You didn't go to Shanghai.

101
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,410
He went to Shanghai.

102
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,445
He didn't go to Shanghai.
Totally went to Shanghai.

103
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,379
You didn't go to Shanghai.

104
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,114
So I went to Shanghai.

105
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,849
In search of the first master.

106
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,687
Are you Red Bird?

107
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,565
BARNEY:
Okay, enough.

108
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,098
I know you're trying
to freak me out.

109
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,773
But like I said,
it's not working.

110
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,841
So I will give you much gold

111
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,670
to stop wasting my time.

112
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,765
Hold that thought, I just want
to see if I can fix this.

113
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,307
(song skipping)

114
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:37,483
(groans)

115
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,152
(all gasp)

116
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,853
ALL:
The Slap of...

117
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,245
Ten Million
Exploding Suns!
500 Exploding Suns!

118
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,486
Three Billion Exploding Stars!

119
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,062
Whoops.

120
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,130
(chuckles)

121
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,625
(sighs)

122
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,667
(gasps)

123
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,372
Relax, I'm not gonna
slap you right now.

124
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,935
(grunts)

125
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,283
When I slap you, it shall be
beneath a willow tree

126
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,149
next to four women and a tiger.

127
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,150
A willow tree,
four women and a tiger?

128
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,952
What are you talking about?

129
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,994
Who said anything about a willow
tree, four women and a tiger?

130
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,360
Guys?
Nobody.

131
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,619
A tiger?
You were totally
silent just now.

132
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,026
But Marshall just said that!

133
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,288
What is going on?

134
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,796
How did you do that
to the jukebox?

135
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,229
Wait, it's fake.

136
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,374
That's a prop jukebox,

137
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:35,541
designed just to mess with me.

138
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,939
Marshall, that jukebox
cost eight grand.

139
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,209
I have much gold.

140
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,181
Huh, that is much.

141
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,206
You got lucky, Eriksen.

142
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,975
I don't like this!

143
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,847
I thought that nothing
I said or did

144
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,215
could intimidate you anymore.

145
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,193
(stammers)
That's right.

146
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,022
It can't.

147
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,227
(sniffs)
(yells)

148
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,189
Itch.

149
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,157
Look.

150
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,664
If you're really nervous,

151
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,356
don't think of it as a slap.

152
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,768
Think of it as a high five.
Okay.

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,670
For your stupid face.
(Barney crying)

154
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,872
So, anyway, I'm in
the noodle house...

155
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,043
I'll admit.

156
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,541
I didn't expect Red Bird,

157
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:16,283
Master of Speed, to be a girl.

158
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,909
You sure you really
know how to...?

159
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,345
What is the sound
of one hand slapping?

160
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm sorry, I don't understa...

161
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,590
(slap)

162
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,193
Wait, how did you...?

163
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,390
(slap)

164
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,060
Lucky shot, I wasn't ready...

165
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,261
(slap)

166
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,734
You know, that tip
isn't a full 20%...

167
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,263
(two slaps)

168
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,399
Train me, Red Bird.

169
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,774
Teach me speed.

170
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,072
No.

171
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,773
I retired long ago.

172
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,605
Retired? You're like, 32.

173
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,440
I am 86 years old.

174
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,476
But slapping is now

175
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,951
a part of my past.

176
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,779
Darn, I really wanted
to slap Barney Stinson.

177
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,416
This is to slap Barney Stinson?

178
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,251
Yeah, okay.

179
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,416
I'll totally teach you.

180
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,555
MARSHALL:
And so began my training.

181
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:06,731
Slap this tree.

182
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,730
Slap the tree?

183
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,461
If you can.

184
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,765
I mean...

185
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,441
Seems pretty easy.

186
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,480
Ooh!

187
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,109
What the...?

188
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,447
Ooh!

189
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,020
The fabled Slapping Tree

190
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,119
of Gongqing Forest.

191
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,191
BARNEY:
Beg your pardon.

192
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,019
The "Fabled Slapping Tree

193
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,094
of Gongqing Forest"?
Sure.

194
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,934
Really? "Fabled."
Mmm.

195
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,589
'Cause I've never heard of it.

196
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,628
I'm pretty sure
everybody's heard of it.

197
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,132
Guys?
Yup.

198
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,503
Totally, yeah.
I backpacked there in college.

199
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,472
See?

200
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,869
Fabled.
It even inspired

201
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,300
a popular Chinese
children's book.

202
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,038
It's a poignant parable

203
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,342
whose message, is if you
love someone, set them free.

204
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,506
But not before first

205
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:00,075
slapping them right
in their stupid face.

206
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,684
As my training continued,

207
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,016
I also learned the delicate
art of Chinese painting.

208
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,585
That looks nothing
like this bowl of fruit!

209
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,125
MARSHALL:
My training went on for a
year.

210
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,730
A year?
A year.

211
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16,562
One year?
None of us noticed

212
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,367
you were stuck in Shanghai
for a year?

213
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,069
I wasn't being held slaptive,

214
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,501
I chose to stay and
complete my training.

215
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,707
I'm not even gonna...

216
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,169
Just, whatever.

217
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,578
You have shown great slaptitude,
young one.

218
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,151
You are ready
for your final test.

219
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,350
Slap me.

220
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,482
What?

221
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,376
Slap me, now!

222
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,187
No, Red Bird, I can't.

223
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,549
Slap me-- that is not a request.

224
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:41,418
I won't!

225
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,524
The Vikings will never

226
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,116
win the Super Bo...
(slap)

227
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,685
Wait, how did you...?
(slap)

228
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:47,657
Lucky shot.

229
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,195
I wasn't re...
(slap)

230
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,429
That's a big tip.

231
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,503
You must have much gold.

232
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,531
(two slaps)

233
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,037
You are ready
for your final step.

234
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,609
Awesome! Oh, man!

235
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,668
I can't wait
to slap Barney Stinson

236
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,237
right across his stupid fa...

237
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,544
(slapping)

238
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,548
What? What did I say?

239
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,251
You must not slap anyone
until your training is complete.

240
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,593
The consequences could be dire.

241
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,790
First, you must meet
White Flower,

242
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:19,363
the second master,
who will teach you strength.

243
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,962
She lives atop a mountain.

244
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,064
Which mountain?

245
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,125
No, not Witch Mountain.

246
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,195
Slap Mountain.

247
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,374
BARNEY: Hate to cut in
again here, but...

248
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,643
Slap Mountain?
That's right.

249
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,573
You're claiming there's
a mountain in China

250
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,138
in the exact shape of a hand?

251
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,147
Everyone knows that.

252
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,478
Right, guys?
True.

253
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,052
Totally.
I backpacked there in college.

254
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,621
It's the largest
of the Slappalachian Mountains.

255
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:44,751
(groans)

256
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,945
And at the top...

257
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,063
Excuse me? Uh, do you know

258
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,132
where I can find White Flower?

259
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,832
How dare you speak that name?

260
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:01,295
That is the most feared name
in 40 villages!

261
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,504
Really? "White Flower"?

262
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,566
I'm sorry, it's just,
it's not exactly Voldemort.

263
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,835
Bro!

264
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,514
Why don't you
just say "Candyman"

265
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,911
three times and be done with it?

266
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,143
Geez!

267
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,846
(fly buzzing)

268
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,958
Awesome!

269
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,034
Can-can you teach me
how to do that?

270
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,832
No, I retired
from teaching long ago.

271
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,465
Retired? You're like, 32.

272
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,800
I am 106 years old.

273
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,636
What is in these noodles?

274
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,311
I'm sorry,
but my slapping days are over.

275
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,380
Darn, I really wanted

276
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,809
this next Barney Stinson slap
to be special.

277
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,446
This is to slap Barney Stinson?
Mmm.

278
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,520
Yeah, okay,
I'll totally teach you.

279
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,015
The true power of any slap

280
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,064
comes from the anger behind it.

281
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,789
So for a truly devastating slap,

282
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,726
you must harvest
the anger of many.

283
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,302
Every time

284
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,000
someone who hates Barney
slaps you in the face,

285
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,673
the power of their anger goes
from your face

286
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,173
into your hand.

287
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:16,537
MARSHALL:
White Flower and I made love
that night in the forest.

288
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,646
No, sorry. Flag on the play.

289
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,348
You banged White Flower?

290
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,180
I made love to White Flower.

291
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,316
And then I banged her.

292
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,222
In the forest?

293
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,223
In Gongqing Forest, yes.

294
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:31,185
Actually right near
the Slapping Tree.

295
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:34,194
Which may or may not
have come into play.

296
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,397
Oh, my God,
you had a tree-way?

297
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,700
And, Lily, you were okay
with Marshall having an affair?

298
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,743
What happens
in the magical Gongqing Forest

299
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,939
stays in the magical
Gongqing Forest.

300
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,871
Best wife ever.

301
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,207
Like I was saying,

302
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,911
you need to harvest the anger

303
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,753
of others into your own slap.

304
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,749
Now, dig deep.

305
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,280
Can you think of anyone,

306
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,715
anyone at all

307
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,150
who hates Barney Stinson?

308
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,757
(both laughing)

309
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,463
I know, I know, I almost
couldn't get through it

310
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,762
with a straight face!

311
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,934
There are just so many people

312
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,562
who hate Barney's guts!

313
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,402
Moving on.

314
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,044
(sighs)

315
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,569
The point is, you need
to go get slapped in the face

316
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,205
by a bunch of gullible chicks
Barney banged.

317
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,441
I'm a friend
of Barney Stinson. Ooh!

318
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,976
I'm a friend of Barney Stins...

319
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,382
I-I'm-I'm a friend
of Barney Stinson. Aah!

320
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,424
Ooh!

321
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,448
I'm so sorry.

322
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,482
I thought you said you were

323
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,477
a friend of Barney Stinson.

324
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,048
I did. Ooh!

325
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,116
Oh!

326
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,724
Ooh! Wow!

327
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,127
Could you... also...

328
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,731
slap me in the face?

329
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,273
God, you're just
as perverted as Barney.

330
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,299
Ooh!

331
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,435
(groans)

332
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,640
And after a while...

333
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,110
Look at this thing--
it's all hot and glowy!

334
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,606
I'll never have
cold pizza again!

335
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,318
I'll never have cold pizza
again.

336
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,151
Silence!

337
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,615
Sorry, White Flower.

338
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,263
I've just got
a slappetite for destruction.

339
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,358
Thanks for everything!

340
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,619
I'm gonna go slap Barney Stinson

341
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,027
right in his stupid face!

342
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,589
Wait, first you must
go learn accuracy

343
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,927
from the one who is called
The Calligrapher

344
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,074
in the far-off,
mystical land of...

345
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,635
Cleveland?
Cleveland.

346
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,870
Why Cleveland?

347
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,165
It's the city equivalent

348
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,936
of being slapped in the face.

349
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,205
Bro.

350
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,512
Man, is this place
a chain or something?

351
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,475
One for dinner?

352
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:37,483
No, I'm here to meet her.

353
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,417
Bro.

354
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,362
Can you teach me accuracy?

355
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,903
I can.

356
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,158
The proper question is: will I?

357
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,127
Grammar is the first step

358
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,065
on the thousand-mile journey
to accuracy.

359
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,972
I'm, uh, assuming there's
no Mrs. The Calligrapher?

360
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,366
The path I've chosen
is lonesome.

361
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,638
But it's no big deal.

362
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,635
I prefer being alone,
I really do.

363
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,047
Unless you know
any single ladies

364
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,549
you-you-you could
set me up with.

365
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,620
Nope.
Good, because I prefer
being alone.

366
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,651
Also I'm sorry,

367
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,015
but I retired
from teaching long ago.

368
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,556
Retired? You're like, 35.

369
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,030
(groans)
I'm 34.

370
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,090
Oh, sorry.

371
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,698
I use moisturizer every night.

372
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,199
I thought my skin
still looked vibrant.

373
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,432
It does, it does.

374
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,896
Look, uh, I'm just...

375
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,265
I'm really just here
to finish my training,

376
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,343
um, so, the, uh,
look, the truth is,

377
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,412
I have a divorced cousin
just outside of Akron.

378
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,412
Now, I wouldn't call Janice
easy on the eyes--

379
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,605
or the springs
of a bathroom scale--

380
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,047
but if you want,
I could set you up.

381
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,053
Sold! Now, the most
important lesson

382
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,285
in learning accuracy...
(choking)

383
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,632
He was dying right
before my eyes.

384
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,561
So I did the only thing
that I could think to do.

385
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,467
(stammers)
Please!

386
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,970
I slapped his back.

387
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,542
And that's when I found out why

388
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,610
"No slapping until
your training is complete"

389
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,608
is the most important rule.

390
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,480
Because my slap...

391
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,149
was too powerful.

392
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,579
I hadn't learned accuracy

393
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,324
and so I couldn't control it.

394
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,750
And, well...

395
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,304
No!

396
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,131
Stop it! Just stop!

397
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,466
You did not slap the heart
out of a man's body!

398
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,413
If only that were true.

399
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,768
You're saying
that you committed a murder?

400
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,477
I was trying to save him!

401
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,779
Shh, baby, it's okay,
you didn't mean to.

402
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,281
He doesn't sleep.

403
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,583
You got to move on.
You were only trying to help.

404
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,454
You're making
this whole story up.

405
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,422
I wish that I were.

406
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,921
Because of the tragedy,

407
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,122
I never got to
finish my training.

408
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,764
I never learned accuracy.

409
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,789
Because of that,
I shall remain...

410
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,786
forever...

411
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,858
a mere slapprentice.

412
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,627
What does that mean, baby?

413
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,296
NARRATOR:
Here's what it meant.

414
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,995
("O Fortuna" playing)

415
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,379
(Barney gasps)

416
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,480
(gasping)

417
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,411
Damn it!

418
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,148
Please! Somebody!

419
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,787
Help me!

420
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,791
There's a crazy guy trying
to slap me and he's...

421
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,455
Oh, my God.

422
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,164
Four women.

423
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,526
And a willow tree.

424
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,926
At least there's no tiger.

425
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,199
Oh, my God.

426
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:47,167
Is that... half a tiger?

427
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,807
You got here early.

428
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,211
Aah!

429
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,752
It's time.

430
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,350
But you never completed
your training.

431
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,223
Actually...

432
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,251
Listen to me.
I must speak fast.

433
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,257
Once you've had your heart
slapped out of your body,

434
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,759
you've only got ten,
15 minutes to live, max.

435
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,431
Sure.
The trick to accuracy

436
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,860
is to, like,
try to be really accurate.

437
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,426
Okay? Don't just slap.

438
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,274
Like, like, really try to aim.

439
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,870
Look where you're slapping,
that's important.

440
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,072
And then try to slap that spot

441
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,935
instead of some other spot.

442
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,683
Well, I guess
that's pretty much it.

443
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,779
You can slap people now.

444
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,750
(groans)

445
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,554
He's gone.

446
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,722
One other thing.

447
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,420
Cleveland has a lot to offer.

448
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,222
Be sure to check out
the James A. Garfield Monument.

449
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,415
Um, I mean, sure, he was only
president for four months

450
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,227
before he was assassinated,

451
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,459
but if you get up to the top,
you can see almost for 30 miles.

452
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,804
As long as the steel factory's
not smelting.

453
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,600
(groans)

454
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,900
He's gone.

455
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,995
No, like I said,
ten, 15 minutes.

456
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,280
Oh, God, this is awkward.
Yeah, yeah.

457
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,038
It's like when you're saying
good-bye to someone,

458
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,947
and then you realize you're both
headed in the same direction.

459
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,209
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's like, what
do we, what do we

460
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,218
we say good-bye again or...?

461
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right?
(groans)

462
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,685
He's gone.

463
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,326
Wait, are you just pretending
so it'll be less awkward?

464
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,203
Should I just, like, go, or...?

465
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,132
Okay.

466
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,610
My training is complete.

467
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,610
I'm ready.

468
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,284
I'm ready, too.

469
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,354
I love you.

470
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,582
Enough to take this slap for me?

471
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,816
No.

472
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,290
*

473
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,353
(grunts)

474
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,294
All right!
Yeah!
Oh!

475
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,050
Good one.
You got me that time, bro.

476
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,187
Yeah, right?
Hey, only one slap left.

477
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,693
Crazy! Where did the time go?

478
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:18,964
I know, it's, like, uh,

479
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,191
slow down, life,
you know what I mean?

480
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,287
(laughter)

481
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,028
Hey, was that a fake jukebox?

482
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,862
Yeah, yeah, fake jukebox.
Nice, nice.

483
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,297
Aw, man.
All right.

484
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,603
You okay? Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, good.

485
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,311
Ladies and gentlemen,
Boyz II Men.

486
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,640
* Ooh-ooh

487
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,245
* Ooh

488
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:41,478
* What is this feeling

489
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,424
* That's put you
in your place? *

490
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,492
* A hot red burning

491
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,021
* On the side of your face

492
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,257
* Ah *

493
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,192
* You feel the blood rush

494
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,757
* To your cheek

495
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,765
* Tears start
to fill your eyes *

496
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,339
* Your lips are trembling,
but you can't speak *

497
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,370
* You're trying, oh

498
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:09,775
* You're trying not to cry

499
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,879
* You just got slapped

500
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,911
* Slapped *
* Whoa

501
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,446
* Slappy, slappy-slap *
* Across the face, my friend

502
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:19,523
* Yeah, you just got slapped

503
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,292
* You just got slapped *
* Oh, yes

504
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,361
* It really just happened

505
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,120
* Oh, yes, it did *

506
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:29,427
* Oh, everybody saw it-- ha!

507
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,572
* And everybody laughed
and clapped *

508
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,069
* Ooh, everybody saw it

509
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:40,811
* How everybody laughed
and clapped *

510
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,740
* 'Cause it was awesome
* So awesome *

511
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,477
* Oh, oh...

512
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,083
* The way that you
just got slapped *

513
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,485
* Ooh, yeah
* Slapped *

514
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,449
* Oh, yeah...

515
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,917
* Ooh.

516
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,463
One more.
