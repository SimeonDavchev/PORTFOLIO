00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:10,036
TED:
Hi.

2
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:12,708
Hi.

3
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,176
Okay.

4
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,575
(chuckles)

5
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,385
So I thought we'd...
try this new restaurant.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,060
It's right around
the corner from here.

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,589
It's Scottish-Mexican fusion.

8
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,093
Scottish-Mexican fusion?

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,685
Scottish-Mexican fusion.

10
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,096
That would seem like two things
that do not fuse.

11
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,759
Perhaps you'll change
your mind when you try

12
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,227
their signature
haggis enchiladas.

13
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,695
(laughs) Okay.
(chuckles)

14
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,373
All right. Yeah, come on.
Lead the way.

15
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:38,173
I was surprised
when you called.

16
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,666
Isn't there some
universal guy rule

17
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,007
where you have to wait
four days to call a girl?

18
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,042
That... does not ring a bell.

19
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,448
And it's three days.

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,779
(laughs)

21
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,124
Here we are.

22
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,449
(bagpipes and trumpets playing
mariachi music)

23
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:53,094
Uh, I did not realize
there would be live music.

24
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,291
So, uh, should we...

25
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:56,523
Eat anywhere but here?

26
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,087
(laughs): Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

27
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:59,926
Besides, I'm sure
we can find a place

28
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,200
where we don't need
reservations.

29
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,629
Oh, you think
it's just that easy?

30
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,933
Just stroll in off the
street and get a meal?

31
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:08,735
Well, let me tell you
the tale of Gary Blauman.

32
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,139
There's the blushing bride!

33
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,771
Oh!

34
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,135
Gary Blauman!

35
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:14,584
How are you?!

36
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,438
Uh, duh, like I need to ask.

37
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,907
You're getting married.

38
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,045
Well, don't let me keep you.
You have things to do.

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,980
I will see you
walking down the aisle.

40
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,246
I'll be the guy in the
eighth row going like this.

41
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,961
(laughs) Right?!
Right.

42
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,319
Good luck today!
Thank you.

43
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:31,858
Okay.
(chuckles)

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,300
Hey, there's the
blushing bride...

45
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,498
Code red!

46
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,782
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God,

47
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,081
oh, my God!
Why the code red?

48
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,252
I mean, if it's...
if it's about your hair,

49
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:56,322
I didn't even notice;
especially not from the back.

50
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,590
What?
Nothing.

51
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,619
Gary Blauman is here,
and I had no idea he was coming.

52
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,324
His reply card must've
gotten lost in the mail.

53
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:03,616
I mean,
where's he gonna sit?

54
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,957
It took us weeks to plan
the seating chart!

55
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,933
Robin.

56
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,031
Shh.

57
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,097
I got you.
Huh?

58
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,972
You're talking to
the seating chart master.

59
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,841
At my own wedding, I managed
to sit small-town Minnesotans

60
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,610
right next to liberal New
Yorkers with grace and aplomb.

61
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,711
Table 27 still gets together
once a year for a reunion.

62
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,054
Perhaps you've seen their photos
on Facebook.

63
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,616
Like I said...

64
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,020
(whispers):
I got you.

65
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,051
Thanks, Marshall.

66
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:35,958
(door closes)

67
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,059
Code red!

68
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,532
Grandma's sitting
next to the band,

69
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,001
divorced couple sitting one
table away from each other,

70
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,070
no coherent
singles table.

71
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,168
This is the Robin's hair
of seating charts.

72
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,171
Singles tables are cruel.

73
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,902
I mean, what if you went
to a wedding

74
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,407
and there was a table
of all fat guys?

75
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,139
That would be awesome.
You're right, it would.

76
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,813
Let's crack this
Gary Blauman nut first,

77
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,542
and then we'll work
on the fat guy table.

78
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,807
Wait, did you say Gary Blauman?

79
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,676
Yeah. Why?

80
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:04,084
I... hate... that guy.

81
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,147
Why?

82
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,645
Remember a few years ago

83
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,587
when I read that biography
of Teddy Roosevelt?

84
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,222
For weeks after I read it,

85
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:13,328
I only wanted to talk
about one thing.

86
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,531
Teddy Roosevelt was
the coolest guy ever!

87
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:17,704
(others grumbling)

88
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,871
Oh, that's it!
No more books, Ted.

89
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,500
I don't like the person
you become when you read books.

90
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,706
Here's the deal: you
get to tell us one more

91
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,068
interesting fact
about Teddy Roosevelt.

92
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,377
One more, and then
you're done forever.

93
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,940
So make it a good one.

94
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,078
Okay.

95
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,923
He went blind in one eye...

96
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,319
from getting hit too hard
in a boxing match...

97
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,089
...while he was president!

98
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,261
That's a pretty
good one.
Wow.

99
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,460
That is kind of...

100
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,061
Right?! Oh, and when he was
at Harvard...

101
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,062
No! No!
Shut up!
Oh, my God! Please!

102
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,064
TED: Well, one night,
we were throwing a party

103
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,526
to celebrate... something--

104
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,025
I-I can't remember what--

105
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,036
when a pretty girl
I had never met

106
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,738
noticed the book
on the coffee table.

107
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,710
I can't believe
you have this book.

108
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,909
I just finished
reading it.

109
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,410
Teddy Roosevelt was
the coolest guy ever.

110
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,414
A unicorn.

111
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,706
I couldn't believe it.

112
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,377
It was a stroke of luck on par

113
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,946
with the 50-page manuscript
in Roosevelt's breast pocket

114
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,154
that helped slow that
would-be assassin's bullet.

115
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:13,916
Dude, come on.

116
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,464
Sorry. Anyway...

117
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,959
enter Gary Blauman.

118
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,591
Is that the Teddy
Roosevelt biography?

119
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,328
Coolest guy ever.

120
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,633
Right? Right?

121
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,095
Right? Right?

122
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,973
Right? Right?
Right?

123
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,342
So the three of us started
talking Teddy Roosevelt.

124
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,272
When he took that
four-minute flight

125
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,507
on the Wright
brother's plane?

126
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,812
So cool.

127
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,653
The time he climbed
the tallest mountain

128
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,308
in Europe on
his honeymoon.

129
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:40,607
So cool.

130
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,178
And that's when I realized,

131
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,275
Blauman and I were locked
in a battle of wills

132
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,448
that made T.R.'s charge
up San Juan Hill

133
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,157
look like a walk in the park.

134
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,018
Or should I say,
in the national park,

135
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,187
since it was Roosevelt

136
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,694
who spearheaded
the establishment...

137
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,696
Dude, come on. I gave you one.

138
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,598
The battle raged on.

139
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,631
In a way, he was...

140
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:03,697
ALL: ...the archetype
of the modern politician!

141
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:04,707
(all laugh)

142
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,208
TED:
Dude, knock it off.

143
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,039
GARY:
Knock what off, bro?

144
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,005
This is my apartment,

145
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,012
my Teddy Roosevelt
conversation,

146
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,613
I get the girl.

147
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,045
Oh, so the fact that
you're the incumbent means

148
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,051
she should just pick you?

149
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,052
Tell that
to William Howard Taft.

150
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,694
You're calling me Taft?

151
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,520
If anyone's Taft, you're Taft!

152
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,385
I'm not Taft! I'm Teddy!

153
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,464
The hell you are.
My name is Ted!

154
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:28,703
Yeah, right. Go sign the
Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act, Taft!

155
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,029
(gasps) How dare you?

156
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,804
Skinny-dipping
in the Potomac River.

157
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,304
(all laugh)

158
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,065
TED: And so the standoff
continued, hours passed...

159
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,065
then days.

160
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,507
Days passed?
Days passed.

161
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:46,013
Finally, a T.R. stricken
by tropical fever

162
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:49,516
on his Amazon trek,
we could go no further.

163
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,990
When he was Assistant Secretary
of the Navy...

164
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,589
Will you just pick
one of us already

165
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:55,461
so I can either have sex
or go to sleep!

166
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,928
Smooth, bro.

167
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,530
After that day,
I have never liked that guy.

168
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,603
So let's just tell Robin
this can't be done,

169
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,202
and send Gary Blauman packing.

170
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,743
LILY:
Did you just say

171
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,238
Gary Blauman?

172
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,099
Yeah.

173
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,567
I...

174
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,266
love that guy!

175
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,877
What?! He's the devil!

176
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,779
He's an angel.

177
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,881
It was 2006,
Marshall and I had broken up,

178
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,024
and I was back in New York
feeling vulnerable

179
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,520
and listening to
my breakup song over and over.

180
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,763
Sugar Ray's "Fly."
You know it.

181
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,518
Man, you know nothing
about breakups.

182
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,957
I really don't.

183
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,461
Anyway, then I hit bottom.

184
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,704
There's a bottom
below Sugar Ray?

185
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,298
Mm.

186
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,299
What?!

187
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,271
Why have I never
seen that before?

188
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,540
I've been using cover-up

189
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,939
and strategically placed straps
for a long time

190
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,811
to keep this puppy quiet.

191
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,079
After all the times
you guys made fun of me

192
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,438
for my breakup butterfly
tattoo?

193
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,577
(Lily and Marshall snicker)

194
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,912
Oh, the fact that Ted got
a butterfly tattoo,

195
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,117
will you ever stop
being hilarious?

196
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,949
So why is it only
half a butterfly?

197
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,555
Because Gary Blauman saw me
in the tattoo parlor,

198
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,959
dragged me out
and talked some sense into me.

199
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,961
Lily, trust me,

200
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,963
you and Marshall
are going to get back together.

201
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:11,055
And when you do, you will
be so glad you did not get

202
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,798
the other half
of that butterfly.

203
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,803
Actually, I was gonna get a
little more than the butterfly.

204
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,007
It's good that I ran into you.

205
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,342
Marshall, Blauman saved you
from a lifetime

206
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,407
of looking at Sugar Ray every
time we do it on your birthday.

207
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,947
Find him a nice seat.

208
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,252
No, no, do not find him a seat.

209
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,024
I'm telling you,
this guy...
You find him
a nice...

210
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,423
Neither of us
was gonna back down,

211
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,924
so finally we decided
to take it to the groom.

212
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,927
(gasps)

213
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,828
Wh-What's going on?
Shh!

214
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Wha...?

215
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:44,967
Who's that guy?

216
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,998
It's my ex-boyfriend.

217
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,783
So, we're crouching
behind a van,

218
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,278
hiding from
your ex-boyfriend.

219
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,149
Forgive me, I'm a little bit
of a detective.

220
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,709
It was a bad breakup?

221
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:01,978
Pretty bad.

222
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,045
Bad like
there was a big fight?

223
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,124
Bad like there was
a big ring.

224
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,363
Bad like this happened
in the past year?

225
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,288
Bad like it
happened Saturday.

226
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,294
So bad.

227
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,386
Yeah.

228
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,500
Okay, he's gone.

229
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,303
I'm so sorry, Ted.

230
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,135
I really like you,
but I'm-I'm in

231
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,982
the weirdest place on Earth
right now.

232
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,478
You're in a Scottish-Mexican
restaurant?

233
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,679
(laughs)

234
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,851
Yup.

235
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,009
Yeah, I am.

236
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,048
It's just too soon
for me to be dating.

237
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,885
I think I should head home.

238
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,390
Well, want me to walk with you?

239
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:46,163
Lots of scary ex-boyfriends
in this neighborhood.

240
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,733
Sure.

241
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,359
I do want to hear
the rest of that story.

242
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,167
Right, right the story.

243
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,069
Yeah.

244
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,500
So, we decided
to take it to the groom.

245
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,036
Did you say Gary Blauman?

246
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,241
Yeah.

247
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,542
Gary Blauman?

248
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01,414
Yes.

249
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,541
Blauman... comma, Gary?

250
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,908
Point, comma,
get to the damn.

251
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,477
I...

252
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,259
love...

253
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,391
that we have the opportunity
to destroy

254
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:23,627
Gary Blauman's weekend by
kicking him out of the wedding!

255
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,974
Yes! Gary Blauman Haters' Club
right here!

256
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,770
What that guy did to me.

257
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,302
Oh... God!

258
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,408
It makes me

259
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,639
furious to this day!

260
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,105
Okay, okay, I'm gonna try
and tell this story

261
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,554
without completely losing it.

262
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,648
Ready? Okay, here goes.

263
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,151
I was at the... (growls)

264
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,323
(growls)

265
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,152
Nope, not gonna happen.
Give me a second.

266
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,587
Ooh!
Ooh!

267
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,162
I was at the bar.

268
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,060
Hey, Barney!

269
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,462
What's up, Blauman?
Have a seat.

270
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,833
Oh, thanks.

271
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:57,132
Your fries.
Need anything?

272
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,974
I'm good, thanks.

273
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,799
Oh, but he was not good, thanks.

274
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,165
He was not good, thanks, at all!

275
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,174
Oh, what? Did he take
one of your fries?

276
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,607
Take one?

277
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,340
Take one?

278
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,108
Lily, it would have been
one thing

279
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,946
if he took one of my fries;
that would have been one thing.

280
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,823
No, Lily, that day,

281
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,852
Blauman took...

282
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,931
...four of my fries!

283
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,300
But that's not even the capper!

284
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,799
Here's the part that still
keeps me up at night:

285
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,702
the fourth fry he took...

286
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,104
(yells):
the fourth fry he took...

287
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,166
(grunting)

288
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,806
Buddy, you oka... you okay?

289
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,381
(grunting)

290
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,880
The fourth fry he took...

291
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,721
...was an accidental curly.

292
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,021
(both gasp)

293
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,873
You don't take
a man's accidental curly.

294
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:06,999
MARSHALL:
You take a man's wife

295
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,404
before you take
his accidental curly.

296
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,166
LILY:
If you wanted

297
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,143
curly fries so bad,

298
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,472
why not just order them
in the first place?

299
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,637
(laughs)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,875
'Cause that's
what you want.

301
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,710
All curly fries.
(laughs)

302
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:21,306
Regular cut with
a few accidental curlies.

303
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,678
That's what you want.

304
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,016
That's the dream.
He's right.

305
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,151
That is the dream.
No!

306
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,356
I refuse to look
down from the altar

307
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,418
as I say my vowels to
the woman of my dreams,

308
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,728
and see that
damned, stupid,

309
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,702
accidental-curly-
fry-stealing

310
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,670
Gary Blauman!

311
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,868
Did you say Gary Blauman?

312
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,071
I...

313
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,673
hate...

314
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,044
to disagree with Barney.

315
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,444
But I love that guy!

316
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,205
I just met him earlier today.

317
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,784
Oh, my gosh!

318
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:53,883
It's you.

319
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,084
Yeah.

320
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,115
You're the poet William Zabka.

321
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,089
Nobody ever recognizes me
for my poetry.

322
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,921
He has all six
of my collections.

323
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:04,961
When Terry Gross interviewed me

324
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,992
on Fresh Air he listened live.

325
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,101
Gary Blauman rules!

326
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,300
Gary Blauman?

327
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,572
I...

328
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:16,502
hate...

329
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,635
...that I once thought
I loved Gary Blauman.

330
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,112
Ooh, this sounds good.

331
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,052
Gary's the guy
that I had an affair with.

332
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,718
Tom found out,
threw me out of the house.

333
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,788
Now the kids are
from a broken home.

334
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:35,119
Because of Gary Blauman,
everything that matters to me

335
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,085
is gone.

336
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,900
I got that beat.

337
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,229
So, I was ordering
these fries...

338
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,803
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

339
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:45,802
Blauman's gay?

340
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,933
Well...

341
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,567
then that means that night,

342
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,471
the real battle
was between Blauman

343
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,335
and the girl.

344
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,644
And the prize... was this guy.

345
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,147
(all groaning)

346
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,409
Keep telling yourself
that, buddy.

347
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,177
I don't want to see Gary Blauman
at my brother's wedding.

348
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,345
Neither do I!
I'm the brother in question!
Now, now, hold on.

349
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,254
(all arguing)

350
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,487
Order! Order!

351
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,332
Robin put this on my plate,
and so I'll make the decision.

352
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,029
Now, let's take a short recess.

353
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,032
Everybody out.

354
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,363
Okay.

355
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,327
Lily, out of court settlement.

356
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,097
Drop this whole thing,
and I'll give you ten bucks.

357
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,796
No.

358
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,480
I can't go higher than ten.

359
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,849
(clears throat)

360
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,619
I'm ready to give
my decision.

361
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,778
This was a tough one.

362
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,446
Lot of good points
on both sides.

363
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,385
But ultimately... Blauman stays.

364
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,391
Yeah.
What in the...?

365
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,862
For one simple reason.

366
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:47,031
There is a higher law
at every wedding.

367
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,460
A law that trumps
all other arguments.

368
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,796
When the bride asks
for something, she gets it.

369
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,672
Yes.

370
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,040
Wow.
ZABKA:
Good point.

371
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,298
He's right.

372
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,736
This fake court thing
is adjourned.

373
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,811
Judged.

374
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,481
Well, I guess
let's go find Blauman

375
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,910
and tell him the good news.

376
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,575
Yeah, about that.
Bit of a wrinkle.

377
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,983
I was just in the hallway,
ran into Blauman.

378
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,916
I told him
if he didn't leave immediately,

379
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,091
then Billy Zabka was gonna
crane-kick him in the face.

380
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,050
What?!

381
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,757
But that's not
even my move!

382
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:16,558
I...

383
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,559
We have to stop him.

384
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,990
Barney!
I... (sighs)

385
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,756
Come on, come on, come on.

386
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,103
So, we all run out
to the parking lot

387
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,529
to stop Gary Blauman from
leaving the wedding...

388
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,402
What are you doing?

389
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,874
This is my place.

390
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,342
Oh.

391
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,041
So, uh...

392
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,983
well, I guess this...
this is where I leave you.

393
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,115
This is your place.

394
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,921
Yup.

395
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,763
You sure it's not
a few blocks that way?

396
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,058
Nope, it's right here.

397
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,291
It's right
where you picked me up.

398
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,956
So it is.

399
00:14:56,964 --> 00:15:00,074
Well... good night.

400
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,130
Good night.

401
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,603
NARRATOR: Eight years earlier,
I probably would've given

402
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,967
some embarrassing speech,
confessed my love

403
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,266
and scared her off.

404
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,977
But I didn't.

405
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,809
Because somehow I just knew
this was all gonna work out.

406
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,314
Ted?
Oh, thank God.

407
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,951
Do you at least want
to finish your story?

408
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:24,218
Right.

409
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,557
So, we all ran out
to the parking lot, and...

410
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,834
Blauman, Blauman,
I'm sorry.

411
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,902
You can stay. Billy won't
kick you in the face.

412
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,071
It's not even my move.

413
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,070
If I was gonna do anything,
I'd sweep the leg,

414
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,272
and put you in a body bag;
everyone knows that.

415
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,014
What...?
Is that from one of your poems?

416
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,540
Thank you for that.

417
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,609
Please stick around,
for the bride.

418
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,984
You're not a Taft.
Even if you are,

419
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:48,584
Roosevelt shouldn't have
divided the party like that.

420
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,075
I mean, he handed the
election to Wilson.

421
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,777
Completely, right?
Right? Right?

422
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:52,848
(laughs)

423
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,915
No, wait! No! All right?

424
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,964
Forget it!

425
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,764
And, James, I'm sorry

426
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,091
about you and Tom.

427
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,527
But you have to stop blaming me
for your own decisions.

428
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,196
Well, guys, take a good look.

429
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,503
This face you won't
be seeing again.

430
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,214
Come...

431
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,511
The bri... the bri...

432
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,912
Gary?

433
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,279
He's really leaving.

434
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,484
Hey, Barney.

435
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,323
You still, uh,
have my wedding ring?

436
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,552
(quietly):
Yeah.

437
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,119
I've got some work to do.

438
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,158
Excuse me.

439
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,559
Blauman will cool off
eventually.

440
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,697
We'll see him again.

441
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,701
Of course we will.

442
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,972
MARSHALL:
I don't know.

443
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,240
I mean, we might
really never see him again.

444
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,510
Because I remember
at our wedding

445
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,138
looking out and thinking,

446
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,014
"Man, everyone here means
so much to me."

447
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,337
A bunch of those people,

448
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,908
you know,
I haven't seen them since.

449
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,916
NARRATOR:
And that's how it goes, kids.

450
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,748
The friends, neighbors,
drinking buddies

451
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,745
and partners in crime
you love so much

452
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,517
when you're young,
as the years go by,

453
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,086
you just lose touch.

454
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,100
That being said,

455
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:12,199
I did manage to keep track
of a few people.

456
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:15,202
Carl's still behind the bar
at MacLaren's.

457
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,035
Hey, watch it over there.

458
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,410
Yeah, watch it over there!

459
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,438
It's become a family business.

460
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,183
Jeanette was arrested
for mailing jars of urine

461
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,439
to Val Kilmer.

462
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,736
No, not that Val Kilmer.

463
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,607
She narrowly avoided
prison time,

464
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,616
but did receive mandatory
psychological counseling.

465
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,519
Hello, handsome.

466
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,722
I should say up front, I'm
not allowed to date my...

467
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,055
Oh, what the hell.

468
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,260
She and Kevin live
in Poughkeepsie now.

469
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,063
Ranjit made a couple really
good stock picks, and, well,

470
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,056
he owns the limo service now.

471
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,098
Bitterman, get the car.

472
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,874
Getting the car, sir.

473
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,141
Patrice has
her own drive-time radio show.

474
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,111
People call in,
she gives advice.

475
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,970
ROBIN (over phone): Because
sometimes I just feel like

476
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,607
he never listens to me,
you know?

477
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,783
Gosh, caller,
that's a real pickle.

478
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,581
You know,
my grandma always says...

479
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,823
ROBIN: Damn it, Patrice,
I'm not finished!

480
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,979
Sorry, sorry, go on.

481
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,087
William Zabka became
the youngest poet ever

482
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,060
to win the American Humanities
Medal for Literature.

483
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,289
He's currently working on
a collection of travel essays.

484
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,156
Hyah!

485
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,125
Zoey pops up in the news
every now and then

486
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,474
supporting some cause
or another.

487
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,969
It doesn't always
go well for her.

488
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,570
The hawk is a majestic creature!

489
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,072
She means you no har...
(hawk screeching)

490
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,973
Aah, no! I'm your friend!
I'm helping you!

491
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,776
Still, it's nice knowing
she's out there

492
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,278
fighting the good fight.

493
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,810
Scooter's been married
for a while.

494
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,354
Apparently, he met
a girl at work,

495
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,980
and it was love at first sight.

496
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:37,984
I guess something about her
helped him get over Lily.

497
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,987
You look beautiful today,
Jasmine.

498
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,919
Like every day.

499
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,464
Move. I serve
sloppy joe now.

500
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:47,031
Blitz struggled with a gambling
addiction for a while.

501
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,959
But after a three-day bender
on the same slot machine,

502
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,026
he finally kicked it.

503
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,073
I got to get help.

504
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:01,168
Yes!
(whoops)

505
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,108
Aw, man!

506
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,282
I'm not sure what happened
to Blah Blah.

507
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,552
But I'd like to think
that wherever she is, she...

508
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,150
Carol! Her name was Carol!

509
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,823
Thank you.

510
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,451
Sandy Rivers' inappropriate
office behavior

511
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,216
finally caught up with him,
ending his news career...

512
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,856
in America.

513
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,890
(speaking Russian)

514
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,070
He hasn't changed.

515
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,544
It took some doing,
but James finally convinced Tom

516
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,714
to take him back.

517
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:40,413
And nobody's happier about it
than their kids.

518
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:45,147
Hey, kids, have I ever told you
how I met your father?

519
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,524
It was at a party.

520
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,193
And as for Blauman...

521
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,188
Guys, wait!

522
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,526
(car door closes)

523
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,161
I'm sorry for storming off
like that.

524
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,695
I don't want to miss
this wedding.

525
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,930
You will be shocked, kids,

526
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,026
when you discover
how easy it is in life

527
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:04,038
to part ways
with people forever.

528
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,110
That's why
when you find someone

529
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,939
you want to keep around,
you do something about it.

530
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,577
So, I guess...

531
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,083
good night.

532
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,093
Good night.

533
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,038
Unless...

534
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,070
do you want
to walk around some more?

535
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,466
It's still early.

536
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,409
Sure.

537
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,847
