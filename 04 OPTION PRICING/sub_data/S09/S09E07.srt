1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,206
NARRATOR: Kids, as you know,
Lily and Marshall had decided

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,538
to move to Rome after
Barney and Robin's wedding.

3
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:07,814
We're going to Italy.

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,311
Si.

5
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,743
But without telling Lily,

6
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:13,148
Marshall had then accepted
a judgeship in New York.

7
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:15,681
Good luck with that...
Your Honor.

8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,146
Until his always-helpful
road trip companion

9
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,846
(phone ringing)
Daphne had selflessly
come to his aid.

10
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,858
You texted Lily
that I took the job?

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,090
You're welcome.

12
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,155
You were torturing yourself

13
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:26,433
figuring out how to tell her,

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,860
I just broke the ice for you.

15
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,495
I was standing on that ice.

16
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,270
Now I'm gonna be bobbing,

17
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:33,599
facedown on a frigid creek.

18
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:36,374
I do not need to know the nasty
way you apologize to your wife.

19
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:39,974
And frigid? Maybe you're
just doing it wrong.

20
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,876
Hi, baby.

21
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,851
I can't believe you did this
behind my back.

22
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,719
I know, I should
have talked to you.

23
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,218
Thanks to you, we are stuck

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,390
all weekend in the room
with a ghost in it.

25
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,520
Room with a...?

26
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,785
We got 13?

27
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,364
The room that's haunted by
the ghost of Captain Dearduff?

28
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,603
Who got the who
with the what now?

29
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,435
NARRATOR: Marshall had
recently discovered

30
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,277
that the Farhampton Inn
was featured

31
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:21,052
in an episode of The Ghost
Network's original series,

32
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,751
True & Real Ghost Stories
of the Supernatural.

33
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,294
Ooh, there, see?

34
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,649
The Farhampton Inn.

35
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,157
I told you it sounded familiar.

36
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,059
TV NARRATOR:
In 1843,

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,960
the streets of Farhampton,
Long Island

38
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,603
were stalked
by a vicious killer

39
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,498
named Captain Blazeby Dearduff.

40
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:41,101
Dubbed "Dearduff the Hooker,"
he murdered dozens

41
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:44,135
of unwary travelers
with his sharpened hook.

42
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:46,472
Ironically that hook

43
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,437
would prove Dearduff's
own undoing

44
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:51,246
(laughing maniacally)
one wintry night in room 13

45
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,779
of the Farhampton Inn.

46
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,824
(fly buzzing)
(grunting)

47
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,588
(yells)

48
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,860
Uh-oh.

49
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,459
He was found the next morning,
frozen to death.

50
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,962
MAN: Boom!

51
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,804
Some say you can still hear
Captain Dearduff's cries coming

52
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,171
from room 13.

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,330
Cold.

54
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,137
So cold.

55
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,670
Help me... help me...

56
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,778
MAN:
We can see you, Ron.

57
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,381
Some say you can still hear
the thump of his peg

58
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:29,324
and the scrape of his hook.

59
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,120
Others say
Dearduff the Hooker was just

60
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,891
a popular male prostitute
who murdered no one

61
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:37,461
and died of syphilis in 1848.

62
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,961
Let's hear
from some people who have

63
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,302
actually survived
a night in room 13.

64
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,459
(thunder crashing)

65
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,126
Did I see a ghost?

66
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,834
Of course...
WOMAN: Yes.

67
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,826
There's...
Are.

68
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,637
...such thing as ghosts.

69
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,669
(Dearduff laughing maniacally)

70
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,080
So, have you seen the ghost?

71
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,378
Not yet, but that might just be

72
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,311
because ghosts
don't exist, Marshall!

73
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,218
So explain the night shirt

74
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,050
we saw flying around our cabin
in the Poconos.

75
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,385
An owl got stuck in it.

76
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,191
We saw it fly out the neck hole.

77
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,594
Yeah, the ghost of an owl
that died in that cabin.

78
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:16,356
Plus it's a crappy room,
but when I tried to complain...

79
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,997
The thermostat in
my room is broken.

80
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,672
The AC won't turn off.

81
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,941
Ooh!

82
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,040
Sounds like the work
of Captain Dearduff.

83
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,782
He brings with him
the icy chill of death.

84
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:31,408
So... bad luck there.

85
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,675
Night-night.

86
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,284
It sounds like you're
using Captain Dearduff

87
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:39,087
as an excuse for a crappy room.

88
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,219
I beg your pardon.

89
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,394
I did not get to be
a 40-year-old night clerk

90
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,123
by making excuses.

91
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,727
Now, if there is anything
wrong with your room

92
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,889
that isn't ghost-related,

93
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,457
I'm more than happy
to address it.

94
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:51,766
Okay, the Wi-Fi doesn't work.

95
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,299
Ghosts interfere
with electronic devices.

96
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,444
The shower's leaking.

97
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,068
Dearduff likes
the sound of dripping.

98
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,773
Reminds him
of his bleeding victims.

99
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,366
And the door won't lock.

100
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,108
Captain Dearduff
doesn't want to...

101
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,782
you know,
be locked out of his room.

102
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,651
Why would a locked door
keep a ghost out?

103
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,949
Can't he just walk
through walls?

104
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,451
Maybe he's afraid of rats.

105
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,353
There are rats in the walls?

106
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,961
No.

107
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,129
And the inn's booked up
because of the wedding,

108
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,828
so we can't change rooms.

109
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,060
Oh, that sucks.

110
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,726
I'm sorry, baby.

111
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,925
Hey...

112
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,166
but if Dearduff does manifest,

113
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,570
you know the proper way
to harvest ectoplasm, right?

114
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,742
(phone beeps)

115
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,741
Hey, good news-- we're all set
for the dove release.

116
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,483
The what?
When we leave the church,

117
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,138
they're gonna release
a hundred doves.

118
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,476
It's gonna be
avi-wait-for-it-ary.

119
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,812
Aviary!

120
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:40,947
Oh.

121
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,021
That might be a problem.
Why?

122
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,450
Because when
we leave the church,

123
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,615
a few of the gun enthusiasts
in my family

124
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,994
are gonna fire a 21-gun salute.

125
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,292
(bells tolling, doves cooing)
Hey, man.

126
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,325
(gunfire)

127
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,597
(dove cooing)
Oh, look-- one got away.

128
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,303
(gunshot)

129
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,295
Can't you guys just fire blanks?

130
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,367
At a wedding?
(laughing)

131
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,506
Yeah, that's romantic.

132
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,912
(thunder rumbling)

133
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,680
(thunder crashing)

134
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,592
(thunder crashes)

135
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,025
(screams)

136
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,658
(grunts, groans)

137
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,634
Ted!

138
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,866
What the hell are
you doing in my room?!

139
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,042
Uh...

140
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,639
NARRATOR:
There was an explanation.

141
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,411
You see, after Marshall
got off the phone with Lily,

142
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,981
he'd called me.

143
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,579
(phone rings)

144
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,011
Hey, buddy. What's up?

145
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,375
Ted, listen, I need you
to sneak into Lily's room,

146
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,675
find her phone, and delete
the last text she got.

147
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:50,477
Why? What's...

148
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,218
Ted, I need you to do this

149
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,492
no questions asked.

150
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:57,191
And as we both know, you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

151
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,861
(phone rings)
Hey.

152
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,203
TED:
Hey. Listen, I need you
to do something for me

153
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,329
no questions asked, okay?
What is it?

154
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,704
Meet me at the corner
of 53rd and 8th.

155
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,304
Bring your drill.
(click)

156
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,913
TED:
Marshall.

157
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,209
What the hell?

158
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,775
How did you...

159
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,213
No...

160
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,778
questions... asked.

161
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,287
I broke federal law drilling you
out of that mailbox.

162
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,189
Hey, I was a man in need.

163
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,921
I know.
You were a "Priority Male."

164
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,028
You said you'd

165
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,089
stop doing that joke
after the editor

166
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,127
of Bazooka Joe comics
rejected it.

167
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,803
That man is a comedy snob.

168
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,131
The point is,

169
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,626
you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

170
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,468
Okay, okay!
I'll delete the text.

171
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,743
Thank you.

172
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,141
I just have to figure out

173
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,772
how to get into Lily's room.

174
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,307
Easy. The lock on her door
is busted, so...

175
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,642
The drainpipe!
What?

176
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,608
There's a drainpipe that
runs up near her window,

177
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,576
and, no big deal,
I can totally climb it.

178
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,775
I'll call you when it's done.

179
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:56,916
Her door is unlock...

180
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,720
(click)

181
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,092
Uh...

182
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,320
Marshall wanted me
to check on you.

183
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,315
He was worried
that you might be scared

184
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,127
all alone in the ghost room.

185
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,829
Remind me to call
you next time

186
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,161
Marvin has a nightmare--
you can calm him

187
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,997
by bursting into his room with
a chain saw and a hockey mask!

188
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,304
Sorry, I didn't want to knock
in case you were already asleep,

189
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,566
so I just climbed the drainpipe
up to your window.

190
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,266
No big deal.
Mm, opened the latch

191
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,307
with this here coat hanger.

192
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,482
I would have called,
but, uh...

193
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:27,582
well, I didn't know if
you'd have your phone handy.

194
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,745
Say, where is
that old phone of yours?

195
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,283
Ted, I am
not scared,

196
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,518
so why don't you head back
to your room...

197
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,624
(thunder crashes)
(screams): Oh...

198
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,455
kay...

199
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,630
Why, I guess you can stay
until I fall asleep,

200
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,630
if it'll make you feel better?

201
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,962
(thunder crashes)
A-And...

202
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,997
maybe if it'll
make you feel even better,

203
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,303
you can sing me a version
of Marvin's lullaby?

204
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,696
Okay.

205
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,808
Okay.

206
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,780
* Night-night, little Lily

207
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,749
* No ifs, ands or buts

208
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,347
* No peg-legged ghost
is waiting *

209
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,153
* To hook out your guts.

210
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,656
Ted!

211
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:08,858
Sorry. Sorry.

212
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,559
Nighty-night.

213
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,155
(Ted humming lullaby)

214
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,496
(continues humming lullaby)

215
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,227
(continues humming)

216
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:24,298
ETHEREAL VOICE (softly):
Cold...

217
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,667
So cold.

218
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,208
Help me.

219
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,012
Help me...

220
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,175
Oh, God, the Hooker's here!
Ted,

221
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,817
I am not gonna cheat on Robin.

222
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,893
But you're a hell of a best man
for getting me one, buddy.

223
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,363
Where is she?

224
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,691
All right,
I'll take a lap dance.

225
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,726
Can I borrow some sweatpants?

226
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,430
(whispers): Barney, what
are you doing in there?

227
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,597
Marshall asked me

228
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,106
to do something for him,
no questions asked.

229
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,038
Sidebar-- I forgot
to get my cousin David

230
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,783
something for his bar mitzvah
last week.

231
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,739
Could you send the hooker
to his room?

232
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,947
Wait, Marshall called you, too?

233
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,579
NARRATOR:
Turns out I wasn't
Marshall's first call.

234
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,346
Can't you guys just fire blanks?

235
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,393
At a wedding?
(laughing)

236
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,049
Yeah, that's romantic.

237
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,287
I just wish I would've

238
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,522
known about the guns.
Well,

239
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,956
I wish I'd known
about the doves.

240
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,631
That's the problem with
us-- we don't think

241
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,460
about checking in with the other
person before doing something.

242
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,625
Honestly, I think

243
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,634
that's what broke us up
the first time.

244
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,636
We're both... lone wolves--

245
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,898
always off in our own worlds.

246
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,607
That's not gonna work.

247
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,610
Not in a marriage, no.

248
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,742
What? Sorry, I was thinking
about getting the doves

249
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,607
little Kevlar tuxedos,
but that's not gonna work--

250
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,606
there's no time for a fitting.

251
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:41,978
(phone rings)
Hey.

252
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,945
Listen, I need you
to get to Lily's phone

253
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,094
without her seeing, and delete
the last text she got.

254
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,119
Why? What did you...

255
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,464
And I need you to do it

256
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,788
no questions asked.

257
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,833
As you'll recall, you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

258
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,632
(phone rings)
Hello?

259
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,125
Marshall, I need you to rush
to the Macy's in Herald Square,

260
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,997
find the utility closet
on the third floor,

261
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,465
and bring me
the following things:

262
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,913
a clean pair of underwear,
a clean pair of pants,

263
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,439
a box of moist towelettes,
hand sanitizer,

264
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,945
and a garbage bag,
no questions asked.

265
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,109
You deuced your pants.

266
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,685
Never mind.

267
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:21,118
Ha. You didn't wind up
helping me, so it doesn't count.

268
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,524
Yes, I'm the one
Face!

269
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,185
who should be embarrassed
by that story.

270
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,964
But that wasn't
the time I meant.

271
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,493
This was last fall.

272
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,757
Hey, I got here as
fast as I could.

273
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,127
Are you okay?
Yeah, fine.

274
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,974
Th-These quacks said I was...
(scoffs)

275
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,840
unfit to leave on my own.
Blah, blah, blah.

276
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,839
"Danger to myself."
Blah, blah, blah.

277
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,141
"Whoever signs me out is legally
responsible for my actions."

278
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,643
I just need you to sign me out.

279
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:42,675
What the hell happened?

280
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,980
Uh-uh!

281
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,851
I said no questions asked.

282
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,649
W...

283
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:51,481
Star, clover, horseshoe.

284
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,488
Barney, did you swallow
real versions

285
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,060
of all the Lucky Charms items?

286
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,956
No... questions... asked.

287
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,692
Now come on. Let's hit
the bar. I'm buying.

288
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,998
I just won 50 bucks from
a little Irish guy on a dare.

289
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,368
Fine, I'll delete the text.

290
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,039
But how am I supposed to get
into Lily's room?

291
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,338
Easy. The lock on her door
is busted...

292
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,010
Air ducts!
What?

293
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,309
I'll use the system of air ducts
to get in her room,

294
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,481
just like the bad guy
in Die Hard.

295
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,809
Barney, Bruce Willis is not
the bad guy in Die H...

296
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,816
Not important. The point is,
the door is not lock...

297
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,649
I'll call you when it's done.

298
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,493
ROBIN:
Anyway, I was saying,

299
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,488
I think we need to be better
about talking to each other

300
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,660
before doing stuff.

301
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,718
Can't talk. Doing stuff.

302
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,489
(grunting)
(grate clatters)

303
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,496
What is going on?

304
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,928
(groans)

305
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,765
Barney, what are you doing
in there?

306
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,000
Uh, well, there is
a story there.

307
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,267
It involves a trained
Guatemalan kinkajou,

308
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,277
a Bolshoi Ballet
prima ballerina

309
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,879
and Olympic gold medalist
Duke Kahanamoku's surfboard.

310
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,912
Tell her, Ted.

311
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,582
Uh...

312
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,546
uh...

313
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,085
uh...
The kinkajou...

314
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,620
the kinkajou...
(knocking)

315
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,255
Oh, God, what is it now?

316
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,963
Good evening,
Ms. Aldrin.

317
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,355
I didn't order room service.

318
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,227
It says right here, room 13.

319
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,365
Lobster, caviar, champagne.

320
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,141
$400?!

321
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,269
I didn't order any of this.

322
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,465
Maybe Dearduff the Hooker
ordered it.

323
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,607
Well, I'm not paying for room
service the Hooker ordered!

324
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,453
I've been there.
LILY:
Okay,

325
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,479
you know what? I need to
talk to the manager.

326
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,793
All right,
where's that damn phone?

327
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,961
You, too?!

328
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,289
(groans)

329
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,334
(phone rings)

330
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,460
Hey.
MARSHALL:
Robin,

331
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,134
I need you to delete
the last text

332
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,503
that Lily got
before she sees it.

333
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,631
Bro, it's my wedding weekend.

334
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,966
Just because
you didn't know better

335
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,471
than to take a naked selfie

336
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,242
while you were in the coldest
part of the country...

337
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,811
First, I'm an Eriksen.

338
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,140
Cold has a plumping effect.

339
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,305
Second, you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

340
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,745
All right, I'm-I'm at the alley
near 22nd and 2nd. Now what?

341
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,621
ROBIN:
No questions asked. Tell me
about that giant trout

342
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,120
you and your dad caught
ice-fishing that one time.

343
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,793
Well, it was more beast
than trout.

344
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:11,292
Fought us for three hours
and nearly dragged us both

345
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,964
into Lake Winnibigoshish.

346
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,693
It was this big, and...

347
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,427
(grunts)
Hey.

348
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,173
Run!

349
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,314
I never asked you
who those weirdos were,

350
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,039
why they kept calling you
Night Falcon

351
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,535
or even what was in those darts
that they were blowing at us.

352
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,207
Your vision came back,
didn't it?

353
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,145
(sighs)
Wuss.

354
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,781
Fine, I'll take care of it.

355
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,315
Just have to figure out
how to get into Lily's room.

356
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,821
Her door doesn't lock.
You can just...

357
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,493
Room service!

358
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,691
Night Falcon, you're a genius.

359
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,822
I'll call you when it's done.

360
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,829
Why would he call

361
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,801
you guys before me?
Well, dude,

362
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,199
you're not great in a crisis.

363
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,331
What was that story
you were prattling on about?

364
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,626
What the hell
is a kinkajou?

365
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,137
Okay, let's just find it
before she gets back.

366
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,169
NIGHT CLERK:
I'm sorry, ma'am.

367
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,174
You ordered it,
so you have to pay for it.

368
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,566
Not to mention the room damage
you're responsible for.

369
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,078
I've got
a report here:

370
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,010
broken lock, faulty Wi-Fi,

371
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,375
you've taken several items
from the minibar...

372
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,024
There is no minibar.

373
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,349
Stolen minibar.

374
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,348
It's not here.

375
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,215
Well, where else would it be?

376
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,394
Okay.

377
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,532
I think it's time
I call my lawyer.

378
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,788
Uh-oh.

379
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,495
Okay, we need to get to Lily's
phone before she sees that text.

380
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,874
I'm on it.
Night Falcon is on it.

381
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,672
Good thing I packed my unitard.

382
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,543
(groans)

383
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,577
(panting)

384
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,179
This is exactly
what we always do, isn't it?
Yeah.

385
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,412
We were both gonna bolt off
and lone wolf it

386
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,948
without telling
the other person a thing.

387
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,954
Why do we do that?
I don't know.

388
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:50,217
Maybe we're just incapable
of working as a unit.

389
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,234
(sighs)

390
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,800
You know...

391
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,098
I bet even lone wolves
can learn to work together.

392
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,973
I'd like to think so.

393
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:05,972
They could build their little
woodland den together.

394
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,206
Roam together.

395
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,611
Hunt together.

396
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,112
Lure prey into
a tight corner and...

397
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,405
BOTH:
Snap its limbs
with our powerful jaws

398
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,977
and watch the life drain
from its eyes.

399
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,047
BOTH:
Aw...

400
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:22,416
Point is, we're gonna
make a great team.

401
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,555
We'll just need
some practice.

402
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,131
Yeah. Yeah, let's prove
that we believe in marriage

403
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,561
by working together

404
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,166
to help Marshall
hide something from his wife.

405
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:39,013
ROBIN:
First, we take position
in the lobby.

406
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,138
BARNEY:
Then you cause a distraction.

407
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,007
(silenced gunshot)
(vase shatters)

408
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:49,816
ROBIN:
Then you send in a trained dove
to grab Lily's phone.

409
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,749
BARNEY:
The dove drops the phone
into your hand.

410
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,324
You delete the text

411
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,463
and toss it back
on the counter.

412
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,958
*

413
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,532
Wait.
(sighs)

414
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,460
It's absolutely insane...

415
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,803
...how foolproof this plan is!

416
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,832
Sometimes it's best
to just go simple.

417
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,567
Yep.

418
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,311
(coughing)

419
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,769
Wh-Why do you have a gun?

420
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,436
Why do you always have a gun?

421
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,475
(quietly):
Where's Lily?

422
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,809
She went up 20 minutes ago.

423
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,284
You're kidding.

424
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,452
Courtney Dove, no!

425
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,051
I already lost Kurt Coo-bain!

426
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,193
I can't lose you as well.

427
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,348
Great. How are we gonna
get Lily's phone back now?

428
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,887
Oh, I already took care of that.

429
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,361
And now I'm rewarding myself

430
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,290
with some of the inn's
finest brandy.

431
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,185
Bottoms up.

432
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,186
Well, thank you.

433
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,197
No, no, that's a warning.

434
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,298
The dove's about to...

435
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,469
(cooing)

436
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,628
What happened?

437
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,326
Well...

438
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,538
I think it's time
I call my lawyer.

439
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,411
(phone ringing)

440
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,979
Hi, baby.

441
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,381
You are never gonna
believe this, but...
(phone chimes)

442
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,154
Uh, someone sent me a text.

443
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,754
TED:
Lily, stop!

444
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,490
Why?

445
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,161
Because...

446
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,490
because...

447
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,985
NARRATOR:
And that's when I realized

448
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,696
that the answer
had been there all along.

449
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,099
Throw your phone on the ground
and smash it with your foot.

450
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,202
What? No.
I need you

451
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,173
to do this no questions asked.

452
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,072
You owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

453
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,669
Hey, Lil. What's...
Ted, I need you

454
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,407
to come
to my classroom right now

455
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,012
with two dozen cupcakes
and a box cutter.

456
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,783
No questions asked.

457
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,782
Lily, I brought the...

458
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,354
Oh-oh, my God.

459
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,622
Ted,

460
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,790
put the cupcakes at the feet
of their leader,

461
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,089
then cut me loose.

462
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,791
Don't make eye contact!

463
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,132
(children chanting)

464
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,358
Ted...

465
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,632
No... questions... asked.

466
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,540
(Lily stomping)

467
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,869
Well, interesting that I was
the one who fixed everything

468
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,405
even though Marshall
called me...

469
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,142
third.
NARRATOR:
Ninth,

470
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,807
as I found out later,
but I won't go into it.

471
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,406
The important thing
is what happened

472
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:04,378
right after the untimely death
of Lily's phone.

473
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,587
So you're saying
you didn't order room service

474
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,289
and you didn't order
Prison Sluts Nine?

475
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:13,462
I am saying I did not order
room service.

476
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,961
It is done. By me.

477
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,795
Your third call.

478
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,401
Actually, you were...

479
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,743
Thank you. H-How did you do it?

480
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,639
I called in a "No Questions
Asked" with Lily.

481
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,971
But, wait,
why didn't you do that?

482
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,405
You must have, like,
a million of those.

483
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,310
And Marshall thought back.

484
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,582
Hello?

485
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,680
Hey, baby, it's me.

486
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,511
Um, can you come bail me
out of jail?

487
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,976
I thought I saw Bigfoot
in Central Park

488
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,345
and so I tackled him,

489
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,624
but it turned out
to be Russell Brand.

490
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,663
Hey...

491
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,989
Oh, do you mind looking up
our vaccination records?

492
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,625
I tried to hug a raccoon.

493
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,802
Hey, babe, um,

494
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,101
could you dig up our warranty?

495
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,772
I took the TV apart, and I made

496
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,142
a robot out of it.

497
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,271
(phone rings)
Hello?

498
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,506
Hey.

499
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,940
I tackled
Russell Brand again.

500
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,805
I've never asked Lily to do
anything no questions asked

501
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,605
because...

502
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,147
I've never wanted to.

503
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,853
She's the love of my life.

504
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,724
I never keep anything from her.

505
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,585
(sighs)
Ted, put Lily on the phone.

506
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,059
Hey. It's Marshall.

507
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,733
Want to tell me what's going on?

508
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,636
Yes.

509
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,398
I was offered a judgeship
in New York.

510
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,138
And I took it.

511
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,982
Even though we already agreed
to move to Rome.

512
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,009
I'm gonna be a judge.

513
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,078
Lily?

514
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,647
You know, Marshall,
I don't believe in ghosts,

515
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,257
and I'm not sure anyone died
in our room,

516
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,761
but someone's going to.

517
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,733
(thunder rumbles)
(Dearduff laughing manically)

518
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,935
"And I see in your eyes
the emerald reefs

519
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,344
"of the primordial seas afroth

520
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,077
"with the first stirrings

00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,681

00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,184
"Forever yours,

00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,685
"the guy you met

526
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,333
Yeah.

527
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,000
Mailed it.

528
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,465
(grunting)
No! No! No, no!

529
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:41,505
