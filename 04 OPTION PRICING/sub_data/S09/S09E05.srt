1
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,536
Ooh, Chicago!

2
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,084
There is this pizza place
called Gazzola's.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,509
It's fantastic.

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,713
It was closed down for a while,
but it just reopened.

5
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,575
I'm sure they got
a Godzilla's in New York.

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,854
We're not stopping.

7
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,723
It's just pizza.

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,421
Just... pizza?

9
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,158
Let me tell you

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,160
about the thing
you say is just pizza.

11
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,204
We begin with the first bite.

12
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:30,259
Oh, the crunch!

13
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,698
And then the marinara.

14
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,372
That roiling lava

15
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:38,012
of tomato and oregano--
it overtakes you!

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,008
I'm falling!

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,011
And that's....
when she catches you.

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,414
That chewy,

19
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:49,416
voluptuous mistress, Mozzarella.

20
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:55,064
Her oven-kissed cheeks crackle
with warmth in your mouth,

21
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:56,919
cradling the sauce
and the bread,

22
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,087
letting you know
that from now on...

23
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:03,057
this... is home.

24
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,967
This pizza...

25
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,999
is home.

26
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,943
If it was so delicious,

27
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,582
why'd they close it
in the first place?

28
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,938
Rats.
We're not stopping!

29
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,246
This road trip sucks!

30
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,962
NARRATOR: Barney's bachelor
poker game was winding down.

31
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,734
Tim Gunn, out.

32
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:39,003
Lily, busted.

33
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,072
Marshpillow,
fluffed and turned down.

34
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,442
We were playing what we thought
was our final hand,

35
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:46,612
and it was getting intense.

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,780
Action to Ranjit.

37
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,475
Ranjit, action to you.

38
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,584
What?!

39
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,076
Hey, Ted, thanks
again for your gift.

40
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,147
He gave us a framed photo
of all of us at the bar, and

41
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,788
he's getting us
two other wedding gifts.

42
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,933
What can I say? I just love
giving wedding gifts.

43
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,288
I love giving
wedding gifts so much,

44
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:09,127
I wish I could marry
giving-wedding-gifts,

45
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,873
and then get myself
and giving-wedding-gifts

46
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,029
a wedding gift.

47
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,597
Maybe saying things like that's
why I'm not married.

48
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,967
(laughter)

49
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,335
NARRATOR: Oh, you know what,
I should explain

50
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,813
why Lily was angry.

51
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,141
Six years earlier, a few weeks
after their wedding,

52
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,607
Marshall and Lily were going
through their wedding gifts.

53
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,176
Well, that's weird.

54
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,115
Did Ted get us anything?

55
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,049
Come on, Lily.

56
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,794
Ted... Ted's our
best friend.

57
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,890
If his gift hasn't arrived
yet, it's on the way.
Yeah.

58
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,463
NARRATOR: But time passed,
and no gift arrived.

59
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,032
Finally, Marshall started
dropping hints.

60
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,360
Hey, man,

61
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,055
it was great having you
at our wedding.

62
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,066
Thanks, Bro,
and thanks for this coffee.

63
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,468
It is great.

64
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,140
You were not wedding absent.

65
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,239
No, sir.

66
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,012
You were wedding present.

67
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,581
Do I detect a note
of hazelnut?

68
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,250
(laughs)

69
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,409
Wedding present.

70
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,916
I think he got it.

71
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,986
NARRATOR:
But I didn't get it.

72
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,391
More months passed.

73
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,023
His hints got more desperate.

74
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,588
Happy Halloween!

75
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,556
Yeah. What-what are
you supposed to be?

76
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,555
Well, I'm a wedding present,
Ted!

77
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,097
How could you not get me
a wedding present?

78
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,972
I mean, how could you not get
that I am a wedding present?

79
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,111
Get me? A wedding present!

80
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,579
Get me a wedding present.

81
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,940
Why isn't he getting it?!

82
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,178
I don't know.

83
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,552
Why didn't you
get the message

84
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,021
to dress up like a pregnant
teenager, home skillet?

85
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,189
NARRATOR: But he kept on waiting
until the summer of 2008

86
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,349
when I got engaged.

87
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,188
So Ted's getting married, huh?

88
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,632
Bet he'd love a gift
from his old pal Marshall.

89
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,958
Well, he can forget it!

90
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,903
We're getting them a gift.

91
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,128
But Lily, this is the dream.

92
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,402
This is the whole reason
we wanted Ted to get married.

93
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,132
So we could not
give him a wedding gift,

94
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,896
and he would know
exactly how it feels!

95
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:58,035
Baby, I'm as pissed as you are,
but we're getting them a gift.

96
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,071
We have to.

97
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,241
Fine.

98
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:06,077
We'll get them a gift.

99
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,253
A gift that'll send
a message loud and clear.

100
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:12,053
A gift-wrapping
station! (laughs)

101
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,885
Oh, boy. This time,

102
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,162
he ha to get it.

103
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,430
NARRATOR: And not long after
that, a package arrived.

104
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,660
Oh, well, well, well.

105
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,465
Package from one
Mr. Ted Mosby.

106
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,428
It's a little late, but...

107
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,667
What the balls is this?!

108
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,772
It-It's a thank you note

109
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,114
for the gift-wrapping station.

110
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,311
NARRATOR:
Which explains the face.

111
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:37,984
Wedding gift.

112
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,251
JAMES:
Hey, Barney.

113
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,949
I've got a wedding gift
for you, too.

114
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,021
Don't get married. (laughs)

115
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,319
Ah.

116
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,621
In fact, it comes
in His and Hers.

117
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,023
(in deep voice):
Don't get married!

118
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,194
(in high-pitched voice):
Don't get married!

119
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,621
(laughing)
BARNEY:
Ah.

120
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,627
I'm not cheating!
Don't tell anyone!

121
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,990
I'll cut you in on half!

122
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,757
Hey, Barney,

123
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,266
can you ask James to stop
crapping all over marriage?

124
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,199
He's not crapping on marriage.

125
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,244
He literally drew this
on the toilet.

126
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,505
Come on, Robin. Please
don't ask me to pick sides.

127
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,141
In two days,
he's gonna be your brother, too.

128
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,307
Just be honest and tell him
what's bothering you.

129
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,716
Okay.

130
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:15,978
(imitating car revving)

131
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,116
Marshall, are you...?

132
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,450
Hey, Andretti!

133
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,386
Beat it!

134
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:23,891
Marshall, are you sitting down?

135
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,164
Well, I'm in a car,

136
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,562
and you were pretty clear about

137
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,004
the No-Teen-Wolfing
Now-That-I'm-A-Dad rule,

138
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,158
so, yeah, I'm sitting down.

139
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,727
Ted is getting Barney and Robin
three wedding gifts!

140
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,138
I hate him.

141
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,140
Lily,

142
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,541
requesting permission
to make a stink?

143
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,513
Stink away!

144
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,952
Hurry up and get it over with.
(window whirring down)

145
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,180
(phone buzzes)
Oh, that's Marshall.

146
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,515
I should take this.

147
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,720
Well,

148
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,751
call me Akira Yoshizawa.

149
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,186
World's most famous origamist?

150
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,186
I fold.

151
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,358
(overlapping chatter)

152
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:05,566
Barney, here's a good one.

153
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,569
What's the difference

154
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,770
between a Journey song

155
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,101
and a husband?

156
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,267
A Journey song has a climax.
(laughs)

157
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,505
(laughs)

158
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,911
I'm sorry, Robin.

159
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,912
I'm just messing with you.

160
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:17,954
Raise a hundred.

161
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,948
No, it's fine.

162
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,120
It's just funny hearing all
this anti-marriage stuff

163
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,390
from a divorced guy who
still wears his wedding ring.

164
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,189
What, this?
Mm.

165
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,620
Only wear it because,

166
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,286
nothing attracts a gay guy
faster than a wedding ring.

167
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,134
Except saying hi to him.

168
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,600
Or being in the same room,
or every app on my phone.

169
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,530
People, it is a good time
to be gay.

170
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,197
So you can just... you can take
that ring off anytime you want?

171
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,595
Anytime.

172
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:47,877
I'm all in.

173
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,878
And raise you...

174
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,980
one ring.

175
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,112
ALL:
Ooh!

176
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,787
Fine.

177
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,049
It's just a ring.

178
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,058
Okay, let's see
what you got.

179
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,091
Robin has three jacks, James

180
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:07,957
has...

181
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:11,095
just shy of a pair
of a sixes.

182
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,101
Thank you.

183
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:13,973
Yeah.

184
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,601
I'm gonna hit the gym.

185
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,136
Let me know if you want
to get some dinner later.

186
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,110
Oh, we'll give you a ring,
just not this one. Ho!

187
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,210
(laughs)

188
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,084
MARSHALL:
You, Ted Mosby,

189
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,252
never got me
and Lily a wedding gift!

190
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,650
J'accuse!

191
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,452
I did, too, get you a gift!

192
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,124
It was a coffeemaker,

193
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,592
and you never sent me
a thank you note!

194
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,592
Oh.

195
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:39,164
So-so... me-cuse?

196
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,602
You-cuse!

197
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,159
Robin, when I said, "Be honest
and say what's bothering you,"

198
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,267
I meant, stuff it down
and never do anything about it.

199
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,469
How did you not get that?

200
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,871
It's fine.
He's a grown-up.

201
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,173
(door opens)

202
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,684
What did you do
to my little boy?

203
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,938
(thunder crackling)

204
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,646
Hi, Mom.

205
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,794
You get your
brother's ring back!
Mom, please don't make me

206
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,189
take sides!
That's your brother out there.

207
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,020
You two shared bunk
beds and baseball mitts,

208
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:12,156
and, when you were hungry,
these supple breasts.

209
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,032
Arguably a little too long.

210
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,731
Stinsons stand up
for each other.

211
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,063
Take care of this!

212
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,967
I...
I'm gonna play
some cards.

213
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,669
All right, chumps.

214
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,172
I'm gonna tell you what I
told Frampton's guitar tech

215
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,244
when he couldn't find
a condom: let's gamble.

216
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,179
You gave us a coffeemaker?

217
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,181
Not just ah coffeemaker.

218
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,883
I asked what they used
at your favorite coffeehouse

219
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,746
and got you that exact...
one tier down model.

220
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:42,156
And you know
what you got me? Huh?

221
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,189
NARRATOR:
No thank you note.

222
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,034
So I started dropping hints
about it.

223
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,059
Do I detect a note of hazelnut?

224
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,355
Wedding present.

225
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,326
Kind of want to say thank you

226
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,934
to that note of hazelnut.

227
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,937
Thank you... note.

228
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,239
(laughs)

229
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,670
Wedding... present.

230
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,837
Anyway...

231
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,746
Thank you note.

232
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,420
Yeah, he got it.

233
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,419
But you never got it!

234
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,221
I drank so much coffee
that year,

235
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,763
hoping you'd take the hint,

236
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,418
my resting pulse was like
the drum solo from "Wipeout."

237
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,027
And then, uh,
Halloween rolled around.

238
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,230
Get me a wedding present.

239
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,461
On that note...

240
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,126
I think you'll like my costume.

241
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,265
Mm.

242
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,769
I'm a thank you note.

243
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,243
Thank you note.
Ah.

244
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,111
Guess you could say
that we sort of go together.

245
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,041
That's right, Marshall.
That's right.

246
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,146
When someone gets you a gift,

247
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,808
you give them
a thank you note.

248
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:41,948
That is how it works.

249
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,152
Give a gift, get a note.

250
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,424
Agreed.
Exactly.

251
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,552
Exactly.

252
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,316
Exactly.
Exactly.

253
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,262
I think he got it.

254
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,834
Yeah. Yeah, he got it.

255
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,874
I have to find a bathroom.

256
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,467
I didn't get it!

257
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,001
And I thought for sure
you'd get it

258
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,906
when I sent that thank you note
for the wrapping station.

259
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,639
"Dear Marshall and Lily,

260
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,247
"this is a thank you note
to thank you

261
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,979
"for the gift-wrapping station.

262
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,915
"Because even though
the wedding never happened,

263
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,521
"there's one thing that
didn't leave me at the altar,

264
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,324
and that's my manners."

265
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,827
I can't believe this.

266
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,189
Eriksens send thank you notes.

267
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,327
It's the one thing
that we always do!

268
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,202
We even have
a family saying about it.

269
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,201
"Lick it, before you stick it!"

270
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,103
"It" being the stamp
on the thank you note,

271
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,006
before you stick it
in the mailbox.

272
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,868
I will make this right!

273
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,207
I know, right?

274
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,141
Hey, listen, we're about
to go through a tunnel.

275
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,436
Guys, big dilemma.

276
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,877
My mom's insisting
that I get Robin

277
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:50,224
to give James his ring back,
but Robin's refusing.

278
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,020
But James seems like
he's really upset.

279
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,163
But Robin's
gonna be my wife.

280
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,018
But James
is my brother.

281
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,127
But Robin lets me do sex to her.

282
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,829
But I have

283
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,501
to spend eternity
in my mom's mausoleum.

284
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,700
I just wish there was a way
I didn't have to take sides!

285
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,704
What should I do?!

286
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,496
(exhales)

287
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,837
Choose your wife.

288
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,012
You always choose
your wife. Easy.

289
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,711
Got any other stumpers,
like how to answer

290
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,014
"Does this make me look fat?"

291
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,645
Well, maybe a little around
the hips but no more than usual.

292
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,150
You're getting married,

293
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,922
so I will deal with that
one after your honeymoon.

294
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:25,922
NARRATOR:
And she did.

295
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:28,923
Belize was amazi...

296
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,756
(groaning)

297
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:35,002
In marriage, being right is less
important than being supportive.

298
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,428
Remember: happy wife
equals happy life.

299
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,825
Wow, thanks.
That's some great advice, Lil.

300
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,398
I knew I could count on you.

301
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,608
He's gotten very respectful
with his fake listening.

302
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,110
Anyway, Lily,

303
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,412
I told Marshall this
already, but...

304
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,213
don't worry about not sending
a thank you note

305
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,915
for the coffeemaker. It's cool.

306
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:58,118
Uh, we did send a thank you note
for the coffeemaker.

307
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,621
Uh... no, you didn't.

308
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,723
Uh... yes, we did.

309
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,627
To Stuart and Claudia,

310
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,428
the people who gave us
the coffeemaker.

311
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,971
Uh...

312
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,599
what?

313
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,073
Hey, you two!

314
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,202
Hey.
Hey.

315
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,966
Hey, thanks again
for that coffeemaker.

316
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,805
We use it all the time.

317
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,080
Especially when Ted's over.

318
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,279
Yeah, it's
a great machine.

319
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,710
We have one at home
and we love it.

320
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,275
Did I forget
to get you a wedding gift?

321
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,416
What kind of monster am I?

322
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,090
Mosbys always give
wedding gifts.

323
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,919
We even have an expression:
"Wrap it before you tap it."

324
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:35,985
You know,

325
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,163
wrap the gift

326
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,790
before you tap the person
on the shoulder

327
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,156
and say, "Here's your gift."

328
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,003
I will make this right.

329
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,631
Robin? Two things:

330
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,065
number one, are you
dropping heat right now?

331
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,800
No.
Great.

332
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,596
Number two.
(chuckles)

333
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,007
Nice.
Thanks. Anyway,

334
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,440
I came up with an amazing plan

335
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,084
that I think
will make everyone happy.

336
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,479
Step one: you let my mom win the
ring back in a hand of poker.

337
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,412
Step two...

338
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,678
No, that's all the steps.

339
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,845
What do you think?

340
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,754
So your plan is
you do absolutely nothing

341
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,256
to get your fiancÃ©e's back.

342
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,458
Okay.

343
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,789
Let me propose
a different plan.

344
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,025
Step one...

345
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,860
Good game, everybody!
(giggles)

346
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,896
And that's all the steps.

347
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,502
That's a really
pretty bra, Mom.

348
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,039
Well, I'd better leave now
before I lose

349
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,478
any more of my dignity,

350
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,052
the likelihood
of which

351
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:37,681
is increasing every moment
in this very chilly room.

352
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,087
Oh...

353
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,493
(door shuts)
Not good, Robin.

354
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,062
Very not good.

355
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,891
How do you
keep winning, anyway?

356
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,456
Well, to the keen observer,

357
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:51,204
all of you Stinsons have
the same very subtle tell.

358
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:52,869
Whenever you're bluffing,

359
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,570
you say the word "bluff."

360
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,241
Hey, I'm hungry. Uh...

361
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,039
should we get
some bluffalo wings?

362
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,871
Raise you $20.

363
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:04,338
When I walked in, I saw
an all-you-can-eat bluffet.

364
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,577
Raise $50.

365
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,853
Mmm... I could use
a bluffberry muffin.

366
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,853
A blueberry bluffin. Sorry.

367
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,885
A bluebluffy muffbluff. All in.

368
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,192
I don't believe it.

369
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,993
Robin, you've got
to give her that blouse back.

370
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,555
She loves that blouse.

371
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:24,402
She got those sequins from
Rick James...'s open casket.

372
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:25,771
Nope. Not happening.

373
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,668
Woman, as your bridegroom,
I command you!

374
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,072
We'll leave and

375
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,914
give you guys
some privacy.

376
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,778
(door shuts)
You, uh,

377
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,779
want to take back
that "I command you" thing?

378
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,181
Please can I?

379
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,953
Why is this so important to you?

380
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,182
Because it's my family.

381
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,957
And, so help me, you and I
will never have sex again

382
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,888
if you don't give back
their bluff.

383
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,593
Stuff! Damn it.

384
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,564
Look, I just...
I want to feel like

385
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,203
you're on my side
once in a while. That's all.

386
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,129
Look, I'm gonna
be your wife,

387
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,574
for God's sakes.

388
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,898
But, look,

389
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,773
if it's... if it's
that important to you, here.

390
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,072
Do what you want.

391
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,705
Thank you.

392
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,309
And please don't play
strip poker with my mom again.

393
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:13,353
It's all kinds of confusing.

394
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,420
(door shuts)
(sighs)

395
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,292
(phone ringing)

396
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,561
Oh, that's where
my phone is.

397
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,962
I wasn't eavesdropping.
Hey, baby.

398
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:29,725
Lily, we were wrong
the whole time.

399
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,232
Ted got us the coffeemaker!

400
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,834
He's a wonderful man!

401
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,835
What? No. Claudia and Stuart
gave us our coffeemaker.

402
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,569
Ted's a rat bastard!
Never mention his name again!

403
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,636
Your coffeemaker?

404
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,643
Ted got you that.

405
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,644
I was with him
when he bought it.

406
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,105
I don't know what to feel!

407
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,114
But Stuart said
he got it for us.

408
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,846
Stuart and Claudia
checked in.

409
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,050
I saw them in the lobby.

410
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,194
Let's go get
to the bottom of this.

411
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,193
Stuart,

412
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,994
no B.S., did you really get us

413
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,026
that coffeemaker
for our wedding?

414
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,501
Of course.

415
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,129
What a crazy
thing to ask.

416
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,495
They never give you enough
of these things.

417
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,543
Oh, my God.

418
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,638
Ted got us
that coffeemaker,

419
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,840
and you just played it off
as your gift.

420
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:16,042
You're a weasel. Admit it.

421
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,176
No, that's insane.

422
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,080
Really?

423
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,548
Housekeeping!

424
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,779
Conditioner thief!

425
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,623
Okay, shh, shh.
Yes, I am a weasel.

426
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,849
I ripped the card off Ted's gift
and I wrote my name on it.

427
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,645
Does Claudia know about this?

428
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,217
No. Please don't tell her.

429
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:33,127
That gift was a turning point
for us.

430
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,960
Ah.

431
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,904
I got to admit,

432
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,699
I came pretty close
to leaving you.

433
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,403
Bags packed, plane
ticket purchased,

434
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,736
topless pics sent to your
brother, the whole nine.

435
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:49,912
But seeing that you got our
friends such a nice gift,

436
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,152
ah, it just really puts
you in a whole new light.

437
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
Oh.

438
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,749
I'm a pretty great guy.
Oh.

439
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,391
(water running in background)
And since that day, on the
foundation of that coffeemaker,

440
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:09,325
we've built a strong,
nurturing relationship.

441
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:14,202
Well, out of respect for your
marriage, I won't say anything.

442
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,774
Say hi to Claudia
when she gets out of the shower.

443
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,413
That's not Claudia. Good night.

444
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,009
Tap tap.

445
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,811
Look what I wrapped!

446
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:25,781
What?

447
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:26,582
(door opens)

448
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,783
(sighs)

449
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,284
So, I went to give James
his ring back...

450
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,788
Glad you came
to your senses.

451
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,390
You can't let being married
keep you from being you.

452
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,793
It's like Tom,

453
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,134
always telling me I spend
too much time at the gym.

454
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,130
Exactly. Is it so wrong

455
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,931
if you want to work out
a couple times a week?

456
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,732
Right. Or a couple times a day.

457
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,074
Or a couple times...

458
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,139
A couple times a day? Really?

459
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,898
A few hours before work,
a few hours after.

460
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,907
Only way to keep up
the chocolate xylophone.

461
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,410
(singing notes)

462
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,582
Still, that's a lot of time
at the gym.

463
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,080
Especially with two kids.

464
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,482
It's like
I always said to Tom,

465
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,483
"I've got to stay in shape

466
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,975
in case I'm ever single again."

467
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,486
And, hello, I was right.

468
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,159
Oh, my God.

469
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,919
I think I finally understand
what Lily was mumbling

470
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,928
in my peripheral vision earlier.

471
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,097
I'm marrying Robin

472
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,599
so I can be part of a team,

473
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,100
not just some guy alone at a gym

474
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,103
with admittedly amazing abs.

475
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,065
Thanks, Bro.

476
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,042
No. Thank you, Bro.

477
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,177
You're not getting this ring.

478
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,510
I'm always gonna have your back.

479
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,075
No matter what.

480
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,623
Thank you.

481
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,079
I love you.
Mmm,

482
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,747
I love you, too.
(chuckles)

483
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,016
(moaning)

484
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,963
Oh, oh! I almost didn't
tell you the best part!

485
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:43,989
There's more!

486
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,163
Really?

487
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,792
James, let me spell this out
for you:

488
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,957
now that I've got Robin,

489
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,466
we are not brothers anymore.

490
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,299
What?!

491
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,033
Uh-huh.

492
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,867
If you and
Robin are both

493
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,873
ever hanging from a cliff

494
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,705
and I have one hand free,

495
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,040
enjoy the fall.

496
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,484
Uh, buh-bye.

497
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,151
If you...
Oh, Mom! Good!

498
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,209
You should hear this, too.

499
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,147
This mother-son thing--
it's over.

500
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,483
It's been
a nice few decades,

501
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,288
but I've got a wife now,

502
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,050
so you mean nothing to me.

503
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,987
Oh, and me coming over

504
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,163
for Thanksgiving and Christmas,

505
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,161
that's done!

506
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,632
No more of that!

507
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,830
And you know why?

508
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,731
Because Robin said so!

509
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,503
This came directly from her!

510
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:31,337
See ya, losers!

511
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,541
Oh, my God.

512
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,542
Yeah.

513
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,813
FiancÃ© of the year?

514
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,752
(chuckles)
I think I know what's next.
Oh, God.

515
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,008
Oh, God. I can't leave this room
for the rest of the weekend.

516
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:45,747
I'm sure we can find
something to do, eh?

517
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,345
MARSHALL:
Ted, I'm so sorry!

518
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,357
No, I'm sorry.

519
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,259
I shouldn't have spent the last
six years passive-aggressively

520
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,361
drinking gallons
of coffee around you.

521
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,063
And I shouldn't have taken
that sewing class

522
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,234
to learn how to make
that wedding present costume.

523
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,434
I regret all of it.
Me, too!

524
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,826
Except I actually don't regret
that sewing class.

525
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,098
I learned a fun and useful
lifetime skill.

526
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,936
But, seriously,
even without the coffeemaker,

527
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,013
you've given us more
than enough.

528
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,111
Well, there is one more gift
on the way.

529
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,614
Whatever it is, send it back.

530
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,477
(horn honks)
It's a little late for that.

531
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,394
Marshall Eriksen?!

532
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,849
Yes?!

533
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,117
I got your pizza!

534
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,885
Oh, Ted!

535
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,064
You are the best friend ever!

536
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,633
Don't say another word,
Marshall.

537
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,201
Save it for the thank you note.

538
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,230
You got it, buddy!

539
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,365
NARRATOR:
And, kids,

540
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,430
I got that thank you note

541
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:37,367
four months later.

542
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,414
Four months.

543
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,147
Uh, here's
your blouse back.

544
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,948
Is there any way
we could just, um...

545
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,420
forget about all this?

546
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,149
Oh, no, dear,
you keep the blouse.

547
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,994
Think of it
as your consolation prize.

548
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,421
Consolation prize?

549
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,757
You won the battle.

550
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,862
But I'll win the war.

551
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,073
Game on, bitch.

552
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,698
