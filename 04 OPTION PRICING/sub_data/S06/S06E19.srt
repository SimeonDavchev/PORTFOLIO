1
00:00:01,714 --> 00:00:04,423
Kids, I bought the
house we live in now way back

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:05,390
before I ever met your mother.

3
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:08,226
<i>It needed a lot of work
but I had a vision for it.</i>

4
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:09,894
Vintage rolltop desk here.

5
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:11,479
I haven't decided
whether to put the fern

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,881
on the right or the left side,

7
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:14,983
but you know, sometimes
you just gotta wing it. Right ?

8
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,051
Left side.

9
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:18,218
Oh, and right outside,

10
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,471
I want to put up a
basketball hoop for the kids.

11
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:21,889
Huh ?
Ted.

12
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,058
This is your seduction lounge.

13
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,893
Sex swing there,

14
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:27,795
vibrating Jell-O pit
right there,

15
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:30,164
rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel
right here.

16
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:32,266
Don't ask ; you're not ready.

17
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:35,002
And that basketball hoop ?

18
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:37,571
Outdoor stripper pole.

19
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:39,807
We'll just tell the ladies
to be careful in the winter.

20
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:42,943
<i>You think a tongue stuck
to a frozen pole is bad...</i>

21
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,527
Hey. Barney, let's go
outside for a second.

22
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:49,278
We have a confession.

23
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:52,131
This wasn't really about
seeing Ted's house.

24
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:54,133
It's an intervention.

25
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:55,401
Oh, thank God.

26
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:56,769
I'll go first.

27
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,738
Ted, this house you bought
for your hypothetical family

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:59,972
is super weird.

29
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:01,974
We talk about it all the time
behind your back.

30
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:03,760
Yeah. This intervention
isn't for me.

31
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:04,711
It's for you.

32
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:06,358
<i>Why did Barney need
an intervention ?</i>

33
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:08,461
<i>It all started
a few nights earlier.</i>

34
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:09,796
Barney, I can't believe

35
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,915
your giant TV is broken.
It's March Madness.

36
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, uh, I think I see
what the problem is.

37
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:15,502
Barney, can you grab me
a screwdriver ?

38
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:16,770
Sure thing.

39
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:18,672
Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H.

40
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:20,907
I got a hundred bucks if you can
be here in five. Thanks.

41
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:23,343
You call the super
for a screwdriver ?

42
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:25,579
Yeah... here's the thing
about me and tools...

43
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,348
the only one I know how to use
is attached to me,

44
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,951
and I am not going to try
putting it in the TV.

45
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,319
Again.

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,271
Okay, that's ridiculous.

47
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:36,222
Everyone should know
how to use tools.

48
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:40,527
Well, here's our
screwdriver now.

49
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:47,834
Guys, I'm
pretty sure that's not Luis,

50
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:49,169
but I can't be certain.

51
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,503
Someone introduce yourself.

52
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:54,574
Barney, I...

53
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:57,143
I got your letter.

54
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,349
Dad ?

55
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:19,559
I can't believe Barney is
talking to his dad right now.

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,665
Yeah, what do you say

57
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:22,862
after three decades
of not seeing each other ?

58
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,078
"So, how 'bout those

59
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,013
last 30 Super Bowls" ?

60
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,147
Okay, now I feel bad

61
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,183
about making fun of him
for the tool thing.

62
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,518
My dad was the one
who taught me all that stuff.

63
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,288
Well, to be fair, everyone has
some glaring gap in knowledge,

64
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,390
something really obvious
you somehow never learned.

65
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,192
Okay, but a screwdriver ?

66
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,127
Come on, I don't have any gaps
that fundamental.

67
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,264
Really ? I seem to recall...

68
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,149
Daniel Burnham was an architect

69
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,134
whose ever-shifting style
and aesthetic

70
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,803
made him a true architectural
chamma-leeon.

71
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,673
And only the most
gifted chamma-leeon

72
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,276
could've designed
classic beaux arts masterpieces

73
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:59,879
right alongside
sleek modern flatirons.

74
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,648
His name might as well have been

75
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,867
Daniel Chamma-leeon.

76
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:06,536
Um, Professor ?

77
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:09,656
Uh, do you mean
"chameleon" ?

78
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:16,229
Betty, I'm pretty sure it's
pronounced "chamma-leeon," so...

79
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,717
Class dismissed.

80
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:22,535
No homework. For a while.

81
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,171
Okay, I learned that word
by reading it.

82
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,340
That's how I've always
pronounced it.

83
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,574
Oh, Ted, that wasn't easy.

84
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,677
It took a lot of "ch-aracter"
to admit that.

85
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,679
Okay, Scherbatsky.
You want to tussle ?

86
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,013
I'll tussle.
You want to tussle ?

87
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,848
Let's tussle.
Marine biologist.

88
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,517
Please, no.

89
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,218
So this really
sucks, but

90
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,654
I'm going to be in the North
Pole for the next three months.

91
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,189
Seriously ?

92
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,424
The North Pole ?

93
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,242
Okay, pal, if you want
to break up with me,

94
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:48,861
just tell it to me straight.
Don't pretend you're going

95
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,630
someplace we all know
doesn't exist.

96
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,832
Um, I'm going to be studying
the mating habits of...

97
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,601
Of who ? Santa's elves ?
Rudolph ?

98
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,470
You know what ? I'm going
on a trip, too, Scott.

99
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,205
It, uh, starts in Narnia.

100
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,940
It works its way up
to Candyland,

101
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,176
and then, hey,
congratulate me,

102
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,278
because I'm the new Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher

103
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,147
at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus !

104
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,750
Robin, the North Pole
is a real place.

105
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,285
You know that, right ?

106
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,023
So... you want
to get pizza later ? Or...

107
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,825
I think we should break up.

108
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,793
I still think about him
in the shower.

109
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,697
Hey. Tell us everything.
How'd it go, bud ?

110
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,966
Where do I begin ?

111
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,536
So, I'm not sure how to start this.
Yeah.

112
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,006
I think I need a drink.

113
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,273
Me, too.

114
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,541
Glen McKenna, neat.

115
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,177
Nice order. Up top.

116
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,417
Look, it's been 30 years.

117
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,652
And now you just
show up out of nowhere ?

118
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,722
This is... this is going
to take me a minute.

119
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,924
Yeah. I understand.

120
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,295
By the way, hell of a tie.
Is that Italian silk ?

121
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,698
I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad
we're best friends now.

122
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,819
Make a muscle.
There you go.

123
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,936
Ah !

124
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,139
Guys, my dad's awesome.

125
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,874
He's the mother of all fathers.

126
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,142
Check this out.

127
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,077
Hey, back when I was a kid,
you used to be a roadie.

128
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:14,147
Do you still do that ?
Not anymore.

129
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:17,450
Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for
The Stones through West Germany,

130
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,619
and their tour manager
loses his arms,

131
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,788
bus-surfing through a tunnel.

132
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,922
Gnarly.

133
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,124
Long story short,

134
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,061
I've been managing tours
ever since,

135
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,731
and that dude high-fives people
with his face now.

136
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,717
You're funny.

137
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:36,402
My dad's funny.

138
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,971
So, all these years,
there's this one question

139
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,690
I've been dying to ask him.

140
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:43,209
Why did you abandon me ?
Why'd you wait so long to contact me ?

141
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,912
You've hurt me before,
why should I trust you now ?

142
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,347
Do you...

143
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,049
get laid a lot ?

144
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,118
Big-time.

145
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,389
Observe.

146
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,228
Oh, my God,
that took you five seconds.

147
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,730
Oh, was it that long ?

148
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:23,483
Life's too short
for chatty chicks.

149
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,786
You're a master.

150
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,589
You are legen... wait for it...

151
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,124
...daddy !

152
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,592
Legendaddy !

153
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,060
The man is a god.

154
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,430
And he's still out there,
living the dream.

155
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,298
So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow
with Bon Jovi.

156
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,467
I'll be on the road
the rest of the year.

157
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,336
Oh, that's cool.

158
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:47,607
Say, you want to join me
for the tour's Asian leg ?

159
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,476
This is going to be
the second-most fun

160
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,011
I've ever had on an Asian leg.

161
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,149
Barney, we-we know
you're psyched,

162
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,117
but just...
be careful.

163
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,285
What do you mean ?

164
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,354
Well, this guy has flaked
out on your whole life.

165
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,722
It sounds like
he just might be

166
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,056
telling you what
you want to hear.

167
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,492
Barney, we just don't
want to see you get hurt.

168
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:10,997
First of all, Robin,
my dad could beat up your dad.

169
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,165
Second,

170
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,666
you don't have to worry.

171
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,968
He's cool.
Now if you'll excuse me...

172
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,788
I have to go renew my passport,

173
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,307
and get a travel-sized rotating
Vietnamese Shame Wheel.

174
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,243
Don't ask ; you're not ready.

175
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,146
I hope Barney's dad
isn't just

176
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,382
pretending to be something
he's not, you know ?

177
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:33,452
Yeah. That would make Jerry
a real chamma-leeon.

178
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,656
You have gaps, too, Lily.

179
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,491
You got nothing on me.

180
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,810
Hey, Lily, can you
toss me a beer ?

181
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,595
Sure, honey.

182
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,433
You have terrible aim.

183
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,001
That's not true.

184
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,803
Lily, at our apartment,

185
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,207
you're the one who
pees on the floor.

186
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,509
Oh, my God. Barney's dad.

187
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,212
Hey, uh, you're
Barney's friends, right ?

188
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,464
Yeah, but... aren't you
supposed to be off

189
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:03,683
managing some tour
in Australia ?

190
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,151
What ?

191
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,753
No, I-I'm a driving instructor
up in White Plains.

192
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,524
And I need your help...
Barney won't return my calls.

193
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:18,508
What do you mean, Barney
won't return your calls ?

194
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:21,052
He said you two had
an amazing night together.

195
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:22,944
That's not what happened.

196
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,779
I'm not sure how
to start this.

197
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,113
Yeah.

198
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,999
I think I need a drink.

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,083
Me, too.

200
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,201
Glen McKenna, neat.

201
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:31,886
Milk, skim.

202
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,888
Milk ?

203
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,591
Oh, you're taking it easy.
Crazy night ?

204
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:37,959
I'll say.

205
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,895
Between you and me,
I had a lot of acid last night.

206
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,263
Wow.

207
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:44,065
I think it was the chili dog.

208
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,734
I had to take four Tums.

209
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,737
I was up till, like, 9:30.

210
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,006
Hey, um...

211
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,308
When I was a kid,
you used to be a roadie.

212
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:55,610
You still do that ?

213
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,512
No. I switched lanes years ago.

214
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,252
I should explain.
I'm a driving instructor.

215
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,120
Now you get it, right ?

216
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:08,956
Yeah, no, I get it.

217
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:10,958
Um, but when I was a kid,

218
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,160
you... you were
this total badass.

219
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:15,062
Oh, I know.

220
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,697
I was a real hard partier.

221
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:18,766
Yeah, okay, now we're getting
to the good stuff.

222
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,302
The drugs, the alcohol,
the women...

223
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:23,037
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

224
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:23,971
I was out of control.

225
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:25,640
# Out of control. #

226
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:28,109
So when your mom said
I couldn't see you any more,

227
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,811
it was rock bottom for me.

228
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,715
I'm so sorry.

229
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,852
You ever bang Stevie Nicks ?

230
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:41,022
Barney wasn't interested
in my apology.

231
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,657
He just wanted me to be cool.

232
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:46,594
And I was so desperate
to connect with him,

233
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:48,462
I did something
I'm not proud of.

234
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,097
<i>I started bragging.</i>

235
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,600
I bet you didn't know
this about me, Barney,

236
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:55,169
but I've published
two nonfiction books

237
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,238
about asparagus.

238
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,040
And one fiction.

239
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:04,312
I'm credited with inventing
the word "furgling".

240
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,981
It means fumbling for keys.

241
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,018
So then all the county fair
judges started chanting,

242
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,021
"More quiche ! More quiche !"

243
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:20,528
I guess you could call me
the LeBron James of drapes.

244
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,166
I could tell he just wanted me
to be this big ladies' man,

245
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,401
so...

246
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:31,205
What a hottie, huh ?

247
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:33,274
I'm sure you're a real player.

248
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:36,160
Big-time.

249
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:38,329
Observe.

250
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:50,491
Excuse me, that's my son
over there.

251
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,561
I'm trying to reconnect
with him after 30 years.

252
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:56,597
Would you just write down
any seven numbers here,

253
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:58,199
so that I can impress him ?

254
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,101
Please, I'm desperate.

255
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,807
Oh, my God,
you're a natural.

256
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:09,410
Think of the pickup plays
we can run as a father-son duo.

257
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:11,078
There's the
"Father Knows Breast,"

258
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,079
there's the

259
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,497
"Bush Dynasty,"

260
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:15,282
the "Lick Father, Lick Son".

261
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:16,283
Oh, no, no.

262
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,752
I couldn't do that.

263
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:18,536
Why ?

264
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:19,787
I have a family now.

265
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,155
That's my wife

266
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:24,592
Cheryl, my daughter Carly...
she's in college.

267
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:26,227
This is my son J.J.

268
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,678
I was hoping you could come over

269
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,096
to dinner sometime
and meet them.

270
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:30,931
You're all wearing
matching sweaters.

271
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,133
That's cute.

272
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:36,003
Look, I got
to get going, Jerry.

273
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:37,538
But, uh, this was great.

274
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:38,973
Glad we did this.

275
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,813
I made him wait
all these years for me and...

276
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:48,582
I'm just not the guy
he wanted me to be.

277
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,652
I know I don't
deserve it, but...

278
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:54,255
I need another chance
to connect with my son.

279
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:58,793
We think you should
give him another chance.

280
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:00,961
That's the real reason
we're out here.

281
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:02,930
He lives ten minutes away.

282
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,432
What ?

283
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,133
You're having dinner
with him tonight.

284
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:08,335
No, I most certainly am not.

285
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,471
Look, I met him.

286
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:12,039
He's not my kind of bro
and that's that.

287
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,207
Are you sure it's
not more than that ?

288
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,675
Guys, get it through your heads.

289
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:18,145
I am never gonna
talk to my dad again.

290
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:20,147
No, Barney.

291
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:22,616
I'm never gonna talk
to my dad again.

292
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:25,352
But your dad is alive

293
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,055
and he lives just down the road.

294
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:32,860
Fine, I'll go.

295
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:33,861
Awesome.

296
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:35,029
Um, Lily, keys.

297
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,837
I'm literally
11 inches from you.

298
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:49,939
<i>And so Barney agreed to give
his dad one more chance.</i>

299
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,342
Hello. You must be Barney.

300
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:53,393
I'm Cheryl.

301
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:55,562
It's just so nice
to finally meet you.

302
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:57,564
I love that suit.

303
00:12:57,565 --> 00:12:58,882
Oh, thank you very much.

304
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:01,284
And I love your...

305
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:05,422
...coat.

306
00:13:05,423 --> 00:13:06,790
I love your coat.

307
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,692
Oh, that's your coat, Barney.

308
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:10,694
I just took it from you.

309
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:12,462
Well, I do love it.

310
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:15,465
It's doing a nice job
covering up that chair.

311
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:19,469
Guess now we wait.

312
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,671
Hey, I got an idea
how to pass the time.

313
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:22,922
A little trivia game.

314
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:26,443
Robin, reindeer: real or fake ?

315
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:28,411
Okay, I'm not an idiot.

316
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:32,082
Reindeer are obviously
f... re... fake ?

317
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,216
Yikes !

318
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:35,151
I'm surrounded
by a bunch of dum-dums.

319
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:39,022
Good thing I don't have any gaps
in my knowledge.

320
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:44,561
I am perfect.

321
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:47,197
Oh, for the love of God, guys,
enough already.

322
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:48,498
What, baby ?

323
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:49,966
You've been treating me
with kid gloves

324
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,501
ever since my dad died.

325
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:52,569
That's not true.

326
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,937
Robin, don't disagree
with Marshall.

327
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:54,938
I'm sorry.

328
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,207
I first noticed it at the bar.

329
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,174
Hey, Lily,

330
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,776
can you get me a mojito ?

331
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:01,845
<i>Normally, you would've
given me crap</i>

332
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,547
<i>for an hour about a voice crack
that pubescently girl-like,</i>

333
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:05,648
<i>but nothing.</i>

334
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,084
<i>So then I started
to test you guys.</i>

335
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:10,954
<i>The Phantom Menace is by far
the best Star Wars movie.</i>

336
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:16,726
It ages well,
that's the thing.

337
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,596
You guys like my new soul patch ?

338
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:22,465
Righteous hair
tab, brotha.

339
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:24,067
<i>And once I figured it out,</i>

340
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:27,937
<i>I started doing crazy stuff
to see how far you'd let me go.</i>

341
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:29,906
Hey, guys.

342
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,574
This is Rex.

343
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:34,511
He's a possum.

344
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:36,846
I found him in the trash.

345
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,414
He lives with us now.

346
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,417
I love him.

347
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:45,321
Lily, we are living
with a possum.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,057
Rex is violent and he hates us.

349
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:50,527
But, baby,
you just lost your dad.

350
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:51,828
None of us wants to upset you.

351
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:52,829
Please.

352
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,930
If you guys really want me

353
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,698
to get over the worst tragedy
of my life,

354
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:57,934
I'm begging you,
tear me a new one.

355
00:14:57,935 --> 00:15:00,837
But not like Rex tried to
in my sleep last night.

356
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:04,307
J.J., dinner.

357
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:06,276
When I got your letter,
I dug this up.

358
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:08,378
You were probably
too young to remember,

359
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:12,482
but this is you, this is me,
and, of course, ZZ Top.

360
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:14,784
I do remember that.

361
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:16,753
I climbed up on that
dude's lap and told him

362
00:15:16,754 --> 00:15:18,188
what I wanted for Christmas.

363
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:22,492
Yeah, I used to love
taking you backstage.

364
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:25,094
You were the coolest
little kid.

365
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:29,332
Hi, Barney.
It's great to finally meet you.

366
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,268
J.J., I'm talking
to Dad right now. God.

367
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,537
Seriously,

368
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:35,588
it's time.

369
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:37,006
What are my gaps ?

370
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:41,544
Well, I guess maybe
one gap you have is...

371
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:43,112
you can't wink.

372
00:15:43,113 --> 00:15:46,282
Don't you think that
maybe we should go home

373
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:49,519
and, uh, "do the laundry" ?

374
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:55,358
<i>You can't swallow pills.</i>

375
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:00,697
<i>Ooh, ooh, I got one.</i>

376
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:04,167
You think John Kennedy and Jack
Kennedy are the same person.

377
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:06,636
Right ?

378
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:09,172
What ?

379
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,440
So, Barney, I understand

380
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:12,375
you have a pretty big job
with a bank.

381
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:13,309
Yeah, I do.

382
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,345
<i>I make a ton of money.</i>

383
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:17,213
How much do you make, J.J. ?

384
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:19,515
I'm 11.

385
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:23,152
Oh, well, huh, now we all know
you make excuses.

386
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:25,188
I was talking about money.

387
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,890
Actually, J.J.
has a job.

388
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:27,891
Tell him, J.J.

389
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,259
I got a paper route.

390
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:32,295
Good time to get into
print media.

391
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:33,363
Am I right, Dad ?

392
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:34,530
Good slam, Barney.

393
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:35,665
Jerry.

394
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,166
It's all good fun.

395
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,903
Just ribbing among
long lost brothers.

396
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:42,739
J.J.'s a heck of
a basketball player.

397
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,909
Uh, you don't strike me
as the athletic type, Jayj.

398
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,878
Dad, check it.

399
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:57,353
Triceps.

400
00:16:57,354 --> 00:16:59,188
What gym do you go to ?

401
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:00,790
Fourth period ?

402
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,026
Sounds like you're having
your fourth period.

403
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:04,027
Am I right, Dad ?!

404
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:05,011
Got him again.

405
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,029
Jerry !

406
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,146
Oh, okay, Barney.

407
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:08,564
Uh, maybe that's enough.

408
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:09,849
Why ? J.J. started it.

409
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,701
What does J.J.
even stand for anyway ?

410
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:15,038
J- Jerky... Jerkface ?

411
00:17:15,806 --> 00:17:17,640
J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.

412
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:20,276
Jerome Jr... ?

413
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:25,048
Oh.

414
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,951
He's-He's named after you.

415
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,870
Excuse me.

416
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,926
I like having
a brother.

417
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:40,096
You always add too
much water to oatmeal.

418
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:41,497
Yes, I drown the son of a bitch.

419
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:43,800
You consistently miss
at least one belt loop.

420
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,168
It's like I'm blind.

421
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,303
You're too old to ask
to see the cockpit.

422
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:49,472
Whoa. Whoa.

423
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:51,574
Guys, my dad
just died.

424
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:53,343
Aw, honey.

425
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:54,644
No, I'm just kidding.

426
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:55,745
This is great.

427
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,480
I really, I really missed this.

428
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:02,652
Barney, what
is going on ?

429
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:03,619
This is mine.

430
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,754
I don't understand.

431
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:07,023
J.J. gets a childhood, a dad,

432
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:09,425
<i>a real family
and a basketball hoop ?</i>

433
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,127
No, no. I at least get the hoop.

434
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:12,228
I'm taking it with me.

435
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:13,763
Please, just come down
and talk to me.

436
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:14,864
Why ? Why should I ?

437
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:16,065
You're lame, okay ?

438
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:19,102
You're just some lame
suburban dad.

439
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:20,436
Why does that make you so mad ?

440
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:22,739
Because if you were gonna be
some lame suburban dad,

441
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,108
why couldn't you have
been that for me ?!

442
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:29,979
Look, Barney,
I know I screwed up...

443
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,749
Oh, "screwed up" doesn't even
begin to describe...

444
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,984
I know, I know, I know !

445
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:36,619
I want to fix this,

446
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
and I don't know how !

447
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:38,855
Please, tell me what I can do !

448
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,056
I'll do anything !

449
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:58,541
You're never gonna
get it down like that.

450
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:10,186
Barney. Barney !

451
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:14,457
Just put the pointy end
into the grooves.

452
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,928
That's it. Now turn it.

453
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:20,630
Righty tighty,

454
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:21,864
lefty loosey.

455
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,872
I have no good excuse, Barney.

456
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:31,474
It took me years

457
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:34,010
before I was even able
to look myself in the mirror

458
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:35,795
for the way I let you down.

459
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,549
It took courage
to send me that letter.

460
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:43,352
More courage than I've ever had.

461
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:45,054
I owe you a lifetime

462
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:47,657
of apologies, and I...

463
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:51,561
I just have no idea
where to begin.

464
00:19:57,568 --> 00:19:59,268
Can you help me with this ?

465
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:05,975
Here, got it.

466
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:13,116
Look, if you...

467
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:16,252
ever feel like you're ready,

468
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:19,522
I'd love nothing more than
to be a part of your life.

469
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:26,596
Bye.

470
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,641
Are you sure you don't
want to talk about it ?

471
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,042
I'm fine.

472
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:43,279
Hey, Ted.

473
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Yeah, buddy ?

474
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:45,548
You, uh, still want

475
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:47,016
a basketball hoop out there ?

476
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:50,920
Oh, well, I also really liked
your outdoor stripper pole idea.

477
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,955
Yeah, it's fine.

478
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:54,891
No, you were right.

479
00:20:58,128 --> 00:21:00,062
A kid needs a hoop.
