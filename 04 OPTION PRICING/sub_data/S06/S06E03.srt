1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,300
Kids, in my early
days of being a Professor,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,800
I had one simple goal:

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,900
Give a lecture that changes someone's life.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Then one afternoon in 2010,
I achieved that goal.

5
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:12,258
Unfinished.

6
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,378
Of all the words you could use
to describe La Sagrada Familia...

7
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,314
Brown, pointy, weird...

8
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:21,316
The one that really seems
to stick is "unfinished".

9
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:22,402
Why ?

10
00:00:22,403 --> 00:00:27,407
Because on June 7, 1926,
the architect Antoni Gaudi...

11
00:00:27,408 --> 00:00:31,527
Whose beard was also brown,
pointy, weird and unfinished...

12
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:35,131
Was run over by a bus.

13
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:39,802
And so, his greatest masterpiece
would remain forever...

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,457
But first, let's back up a few days.

15
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,443
Ted, look across the bar.

16
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:49,962
Three chicks: one hot, one kind of hot

17
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:51,998
and one who I'm assuming is really funny.

18
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,182
We ride !

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,903
What's wrong ?

20
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:57,954
I don't know.

21
00:00:57,955 --> 00:00:59,522
Got a burger coming.

22
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:01,324
Bro, I told you,

23
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,860
if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.

24
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:06,496
Yeah, I'm not going to go
through that again.

25
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:08,247
Hi.

26
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:09,832
Barney Stinson.

27
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,418
And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.

28
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,091
Thank you for your time.

29
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,894
Fine. I'll have a three-way
with hot and kind of hot

30
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:23,012
while Giggles works the camera.

31
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:24,180
I ride !

32
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:26,849
So, get this:

33
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,935
Last night, I was watching TV,
and it turns out,

34
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,436
some random satellite channel

35
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:33,122
picks up a certain local Chicago newscast.

36
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:36,659
And now,
the 11:00 news with Don Frank.

37
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,610
Boo !

38
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:39,245
Oh, man, it's bad enough

39
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:40,913
to have to go through a horrible breakup,

40
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:43,082
but then have that person
pop up on your TV ?

41
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,333
Are you okay ?

42
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:46,536
Well, I'll admit, at first,
I felt a little weird.

43
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:49,422
But after the initial shock,
I realized something:

44
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:51,290
I've moved on.

45
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:56,462
Finished with that.

46
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,249
It was a peaceful moment of closure.

47
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,217
That's great.

48
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:03,469
- Good on you.
- Yeah, thank you.

49
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,587
Where's the poop, Robin ?

50
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,822
Excuse me ?

51
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:08,474
When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean.

52
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:11,360
Whenever he made the face
that you're making right now,

53
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:14,831
you just knew he pooped
somewhere in the house.

54
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:17,433
Where's the poop, Robin ?

55
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:19,535
I don't know what you're talking
about. Where's the poop, Robin ?

56
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,154
- There's no poop.
- Where's the poop ?

57
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:22,438
Okay.

58
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,957
So it wasn't entirely
a peaceful moment of closure.

59
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,627
Hey, Don, here's some breaking news:

60
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:31,280
There's a zit breaking out
on your forehead.

61
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:35,635
Finished with that.

62
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,091
Look, I'm not proud,
but Don left so quickly

63
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:44,510
that I never got the chance
to have that final showdown.

64
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:48,964
So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good.

65
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,266
And you know what ?

66
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:53,186
Now I truly am over him.

67
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:54,821
- That's great.
- Thank you.

68
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:55,855
Good on you.

69
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:57,156
Where's the poop, Robin ?

70
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:58,524
Damn it !

71
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:01,744
Okay, in the process
of truly getting over him,

72
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:04,030
I may have called him

73
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:07,633
and left an... Indelicate voice mail.

74
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:09,886
I am gonna kill you.

75
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:13,289
I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kill you,

76
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,060
put your stupid face
on a deep dish pizza and eat it.

77
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:20,213
And then maybe catch a Bears game.

78
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:24,600
But mostly the killing
and eating your face thing.

79
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:25,834
Give me your phone.

80
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:27,470
We're deleting Don's number.

81
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:28,771
Don't worry.

82
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:30,339
I am never doing that again.

83
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,574
It was a one-time thing.

84
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:32,558
Prove it.

85
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:33,559
Delete contact.

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,147
There. Deleted.

87
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:39,649
Oh, hey !

88
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,984
Back already.

89
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:44,070
How was flying solo ?

90
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:48,958
And by "solo," I mean
so low that you got shot down.

91
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,327
Look, I didn't get shot down.

92
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:53,596
Trust me, I'll get the yes.

93
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:57,917
Barney Stinson always gets the yes.

94
00:03:57,918 --> 00:03:59,252
This is all

95
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:00,253
part of the plan.

96
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:01,504
After initial contact,

97
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:03,472
I'm now in the ignoring phase.

98
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:05,992
Barney, why can't you just
take a girl out to dinner

99
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:07,193
like a normal person ?

100
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:11,847
Golden rule: I do not
buy dinner to get the yes.

101
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:14,617
Dinner's a very intimate activity.

102
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:15,735
It requires

103
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:18,571
a level of connection and eye contact

104
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:19,789
that sex just doesn't.

105
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,774
Call me old-fashioned,

106
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:24,660
but I need to have sex
with a girl at least three times

107
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:27,029
before I'll even consider
having dinner with her.

108
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,115
The next day, at the university,

109
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:30,082
i had a surprise visitor.

110
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,900
What are you doing here ?

111
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:33,336
Oh, God !

112
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:34,787
You're dating one of my students.

113
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,422
It's Rachel, isn't it ?

114
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,341
Barney, I know
she wears provocative sweaters,

115
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:39,375
but she's 19 !

116
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:40,209
Ugh.

117
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,510
Now I'm gonna have to hear

118
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:42,795
all about it, right ?

119
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,714
Go on, tell me every detail.

120
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:46,632
No, you pent-up old perv.

121
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,250
I brought you a present.

122
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:52,355
Recognize this ?

123
00:04:52,356 --> 00:04:53,889
It's my building.

124
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,759
Kids, you may remember that,
a few years earlier,

125
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,112
i was chosen to design
the new Manhattan headquarters

126
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:01,447
for Goliath National Bank.

127
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:04,200
It was the opportunity
every architect dreams about.

128
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:07,286
And when the project
was ultimately scrapped...

129
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:08,955
It broke my heart.

130
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:12,708
Do you remember how awesome
it was to be co-workers...

131
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,494
Nay, bro-workers ?

132
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:17,446
Wait a minute. Y... You don't mean...

133
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:20,416
Ted Mosby, it's back on.

134
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:23,302
We're gonna build your building.

135
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:40,199
This is awesome...
You're designing our new headquarters.

136
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,484
Now, there will be voices that tell you

137
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:44,636
a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible.

138
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:47,100
You've got to shut those voices out.

139
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,900
Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,493
No ? Are you kidding me ?

141
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:53,495
But designing a building in New York City

142
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:54,946
is your lifelong dream.

143
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:57,599
I do not want to work for GNB again.

144
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,833
Those guys are evil.

145
00:05:58,834 --> 00:05:59,901
No offense, Marshall.

146
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,870
Dude, none taken.

147
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:06,257
Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars.

148
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:09,127
But the Death Star's gonna
get built either way.

149
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:11,429
And don't you think
the architect of the Death Star

150
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,082
is pretty psyched to have that
thing on his space resume ?

151
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,249
I mean, yes,

152
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,918
his design was flawed in the sense

153
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,020
that a single bullet
fired into a particular vent

154
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:20,638
would explode the whole thing.

155
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,474
For all we know,
that was the contractor's fault.

156
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,726
But that won't happen on
your watch... You know why ?

157
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:25,810
Because you're Ted Mosby !

158
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:28,146
And you are gonna design
the most beautiful,

159
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:30,698
ventless, rebel-proof
building in Manhattan,

160
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,318
with clearly marked emergency stops

161
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,436
for every trash compactor
on the detention level.

162
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,906
Look, I know this is hard to understand,

163
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:41,843
but right now, I have a quiet,
simple, happy little life.

164
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:43,495
And I like it that way.

165
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,114
I know what my answer has to be.

166
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,549
I can't take the job, Barney.

167
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,217
I'm done with that life.

168
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:50,284
No hard feelings ?

169
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,170
Of course not.

170
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:54,288
All right.

171
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,059
- Hey, Professor Mosby.
- Hey, Rachel.

172
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:02,480
And I thought that was the end of the story.

173
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:03,565
But then that night...

174
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:04,516
I'm telling you,

175
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,401
no architect would ever design

176
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:09,104
a giant exposed vent right over
a Death Star's core reactor.

177
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,304
That's Space Architecture 101.

178
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,323
It had to be the contractor.

179
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:13,575
Barney, back me up.

180
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,027
Barney.

181
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,913
Dude, this is important.

182
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:20,098
I need another drink.

183
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,533
Marshall, you want anything ?

184
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:23,985
No, I'm fine.

185
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:28,273
Okay, I get that he's mad at me
for turning down the job,

186
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:29,557
but acting like I'm not even here ?

187
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:31,826
Wait, you turned down the job ? When ?

188
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,660
This morning.

189
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,096
That's so weird.

190
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:37,682
Just, like, an hour ago,
when we were leaving work...

191
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:39,834
So, you still think
Ted's gonna take the job ?

192
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,436
Please.

193
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:42,654
I'll get the yes.

194
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:46,891
Barney Stinson always gets the yes.

195
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:49,727
Huh.

196
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,946
Am I wrong or is that
exactly what Barney says

197
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:53,765
when he's putting the moves on a girl ?

198
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,016
Exactly. I mean, it's almost like

199
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,234
he's putting the moves on you.

200
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,535
Yeah, more like the opposite.

201
00:07:57,536 --> 00:08:00,355
He's been ignoring me all night.

202
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,273
- Oh.
- Oh.

203
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,176
Barney wants me to take the job so bad

204
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:06,361
he's putting the moves on me ?

205
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,863
I hope that's his end game.

206
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:09,881
Actually, I don't.

207
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:11,633
I like you two together.

208
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:12,667
I don't buy it.

209
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,252
That's crazy, even for Barney.

210
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:15,336
Okay, well, think about it.

211
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,971
We've seen his moves countless times.

212
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:19,641
What does he do after
he's done ignoring a girl ?

213
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:21,643
Chrissy, I love your glasses.

214
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:22,677
Really ?

215
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:23,878
They totally pull focus up

216
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,947
from that whole chin
situation you got going on.

217
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,099
To Chrissy.

218
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,068
The backhanded compliment

219
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,604
to lower her self-esteem...
A proven winner.

220
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:33,605
But Barney hasn't done...

221
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:35,607
Ted, I admire your loyalty.

222
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:38,359
You've had that hairstyle forever.

223
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,994
You don't care that it's out of fashion

224
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:41,880
or that it's been co-opted
by the lesbian community.

225
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:43,064
You stick with it.

226
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:44,832
To Ted.

227
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:47,568
Hey, Lily !

228
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,405
Don't "hey, Lily" me.

229
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,325
I smelled poop all the way
from the hallway.

230
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,927
Oh, no, not this again.

231
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:57,295
Where's the poop, Robin ?

232
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,048
Okay, I left Don another message.

233
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,250
"This just in"

234
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,685
is what I'm gonna say

235
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:05,920
when I'm stabbing you".

236
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,355
But that's impossible.

237
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:08,589
You deleted his number.

238
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,557
I tried to.

239
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:10,692
But then this thing popped up

240
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:12,426
on my phone that said, "are you sure ?"

241
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,611
And I wasn't sure.

242
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:15,113
I can't lie to my phone.

243
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:18,399
Oh, sweetie, I totally understand.

244
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,484
Delete it !

245
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,985
It's not that easy, okay ?

246
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:22,436
You're not just deleting a number,

247
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,572
you're deleting a part of your life.

248
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:25,606
You know, all those

249
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,125
memories, all those experiences.

250
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:30,044
It's like you're admitting
they're gone forever.

251
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,963
I know, sweetie.

252
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:33,131
I know.

253
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:34,382
Delete it !

254
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, if it's that easy,

255
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,952
I'm gonna delete one of
your numbers from your phone,

256
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:38,836
see how you like it.

257
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:39,887
My "plezh".

258
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:41,806
If you can find a number in there

259
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:44,125
that I don't call regularly,
I'll gladly delete it.

260
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,727
Super Kicks Karate.

261
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:46,761
No, not that one.

262
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:48,396
That's my dojo.

263
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:49,897
You have a dojo ?

264
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:52,934
I took an introductory karate class.

265
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,070
Oops, wrong room.

266
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:59,157
Where do the grown-ups go
for the real karate class ?

267
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:00,942
What's the matter, lady ?

268
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:02,143
You scared ?

269
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,195
Of you ? Please.

270
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,913
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

271
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:07,966
I hated kindergarten.

272
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,701
All three times.

273
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:14,872
But I'm totally gonna
sign up for more lessons.

274
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:17,425
How long ago did you take that class ?

275
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:18,492
I don't know.

276
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,927
It was around the time

277
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:23,431
when everyone was going, "Wassuuuuuuup !"

278
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,167
How do you even remember that ?

279
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,770
Wassuuuuuup... !

280
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:31,889
Lily, this is a number
that you will never dial again.

281
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,724
- I might.
- No, no.

282
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:34,058
But you keep it in your phone

283
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,810
because it reminds you
of a version of yourself

284
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:38,396
that you could be, even if
it's a version of yourself

285
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:39,614
that you'll never become.

286
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:40,848
And that's okay.

287
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,200
No, it's not.

288
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:43,318
Okay, you know what ?

289
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,320
There, gone.

290
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:46,537
Your move, Scherbatsky.

291
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,874
I finally know what your kind goes through.

292
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,409
I get it now.

293
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,694
For the last time,
I don't care how big it was,

294
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,529
it is not the same as giving birth.

295
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,498
Ew. No.

296
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:59,467
Barney's been "putting the moves" on Ted.

297
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:02,136
Oh, that sucks.

298
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,422
Although I like you two together.

299
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:07,141
No, he's been doing it to try
to get Ted to design

300
00:11:07,142 --> 00:11:09,260
the new GNB tower.

301
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:10,544
Which moves are we talking about ?

302
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,613
Did he do the thing where
he brags on himself

303
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:13,731
in the form of a complaint ?

304
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:15,099
Man, every time

305
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,151
I take out my business card

306
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:20,388
and women see the GNB logo,
they throw themselves at me.

307
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,606
I miss the chase.

308
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:23,241
It sucks !

309
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:24,542
Man, the courtside Knicks seats

310
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,529
that are available to all
upper level GNB employees

311
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,081
are too close to the action.

312
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,749
I keep getting sweat on my suit.

313
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,034
It sucks !

314
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:34,168
Man,

315
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:36,904
GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive

316
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,474
it gives me the freedom to see
any doctor I want.

317
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:41,259
It sucks !

318
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,410
He did.

319
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,095
And the intense eye contact thing ?

320
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:45,630
So, Ted,

321
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:49,133
would you like to split
some jalapeño poppers ?

322
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,440
Okay.

323
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:56,590
Yep.

324
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,643
And the thing where he establishs intimacy

325
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:00,311
through physical contact ?

326
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,480
You know why jalapeño poppers are so good ?

327
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:04,031
It's the cream cheese.

328
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:06,951
That is so true.

329
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:08,202
Yeah...

330
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:10,905
Cream cheese has a mild flav... Flavor

331
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:15,042
so it... It balances out
the spiciness of the jal...

332
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:17,278
The spiciness of the...

333
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,547
Dude !

334
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,799
So at any point in this

335
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,784
did you say, "Barney,
I know what you're doing,

336
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,186
and it's not going to work.

337
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:26,671
I am not taking that job ?"

338
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:29,690
Well, I mean, not exactly in those...

339
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:31,092
You're loving this.

340
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:32,126
No.

341
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,361
You are.

342
00:12:33,362 --> 00:12:35,629
You're loving the attention.

343
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,483
It's nice to be wanted, okay ?

344
00:12:38,484 --> 00:12:41,686
And, yes, this is a new vest.
Thank you all for noticing.

345
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,037
Oh, that's right, you didn't.

346
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:44,238
Barney did !

347
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,640
Oh, Teddy,

348
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,641
you are so going to spread your legs

349
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,477
and design that building.

350
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,696
I am not that kind of architect.

351
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,651
So get this... Robin never
deleted Don's number.

352
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,703
Wait...

353
00:12:58,704 --> 00:12:59,837
Boo !

354
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:01,255
Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy.

355
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:02,373
Give me your phone.

356
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:03,541
Let's delete one of yours.

357
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:04,792
Okay.

358
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:06,160
No problem.

359
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,212
If you can find a number that I don't need

360
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:09,931
or shouldn't have in here, be my guest,

361
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:11,516
but good luck.

362
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,384
I keep my phone tight.

363
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:15,386
- Edwin.
- Oh, no, not that one.

364
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:18,222
That's the booker for the club
that my band plays at.

365
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:20,258
You know, my all-lawyer
funk band... You remember...

366
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,060
The Funk, the Whole Funk
and Nothing but the Funk.

367
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:27,815
# Your witness lied
so your case is sunk, hah ! #

368
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:31,702
# I sentence you to a life of funk #

369
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:33,621
# counselors, how do you plead ? #

370
00:13:33,622 --> 00:13:35,490
# funky. #

371
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:38,025
Kick it.

372
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,965
You guys played one gig four years ago.

373
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:45,416
I'm deleting it.

374
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,752
No, no, we're gonna... We're
gonna play another gig again.

375
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:48,970
Probably really soon.

376
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:51,205
It's just we all got super busy, and...

377
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,309
We're not going to play
another gig again, are we ?

378
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,061
Probably not, baby.

379
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,347
See, it's hard to hit
that delete button, isn't it ?

380
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:01,983
Well, it's just that without
that number in my phone,

381
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,384
I'm just a corporate lawyer

382
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,404
working 60 very un-funky hours a week.

383
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:08,022
Sorry, Marshall.

384
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:10,658
But if I have to, you have to.

385
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:18,966
Okay. Your turn.

386
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,381
Barney, I gotta tell you something.

387
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,216
Oh, that reminds me.

388
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:37,935
I got you a little airplane.

389
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:40,805
It represents the spirit of adventure.

390
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:42,640
Do you like it, Ted ?

391
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:45,343
Do you ?

392
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,394
Stop it.

393
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:47,695
Stop looking at me

394
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:50,398
like I'm the only person
in the world who matters.

395
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,650
I'm not designing the GNB Tower.

396
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:53,868
Yeah, I know.

397
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:54,969
You turned it down.

398
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,103
We hired someone else.

399
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,338
Oh.

400
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,824
Oh.

401
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,075
Can you believe it ?

402
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:02,943
He's resorting
to the oldest move in the book.

403
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,129
The classic, "pretend to take
the offer off the table

404
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,380
so I'll want it more".

405
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:07,548
It's so obvious, right ?

406
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:09,450
As if that's going to make me be like,

407
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,836
"oh, God, I never should have said no".

408
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:13,354
It's not a move, dude.

409
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:16,691
I executed the paperwork for
the new architect this morning.

410
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:18,976
Barney wasn't lying.

411
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:22,415
Oh, God, I never should have said no !

412
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,500
Come on, GNB didn't really
hire a new architect.

413
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,993
This is just one of Barney's moves.

414
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:31,227
It's not a move, dude.

415
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:32,812
The senior partners were getting impatient.

416
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:35,465
I thought you didn't even want the job.

417
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:36,348
I didn't !

418
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:40,886
I don't ! I don't. I don't !

419
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:43,138
- Okay, I'll do it !
- What ?

420
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,024
Ted, it's too late.

421
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:46,141
I'll design it for half

422
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:47,776
of what you're paying the other architect.

423
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:50,646
And you know I will do stuff
they would never do.

424
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:52,865
Lobby stuff.

425
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,116
Wow, half ?

426
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:55,985
Ted,

427
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:57,769
on behalf of Goliath National Bank...

428
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,954
Okay, it's a move.

429
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:00,572
- What ?
- Dude !

430
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:01,991
There is no other architect.

431
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,459
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied.

432
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,776
I was being Barney's wingman,

433
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,578
and I never get to be the wingman.

434
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:08,113
You guys lied to me ?

435
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:09,498
You're the world's worst wingman.

436
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:12,217
You know what ? I'm out of here.

437
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:14,119
I can do better. Take me back.

438
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,671
You son of a bitch !

439
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:18,173
Look, I can't do business
with people who lie to me.

440
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:21,176
We only lied to you to make you
realize that you want this job.

441
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:22,344
No, I don't.

442
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,096
I mean, I know I said I did,

443
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:26,231
but that's only because I fell for the same

444
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:28,100
creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours

445
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:29,184
that countless women...

446
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:30,302
236.

447
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:31,520
Before me fell for.

448
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:32,738
Wow, respect.

449
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:37,693
No... Ted... You want to do this, okay ?

450
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:39,528
You're just scared of getting hurt again.

451
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,497
But you can't let fear steal your funk.

452
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,749
That is good. There is a song in there.

453
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,067
Excuse me.

454
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,537
Come on, Ted !

455
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:49,788
This is your dream.

456
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,824
No, it's not. Not anymore.
And you know what ?

457
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:56,295
Letting go of that dream was
the best decision I ever made.

458
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:57,429
You guys actually think

459
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,481
I have some lingering itch
to be an architect ?

460
00:16:59,482 --> 00:17:01,433
Work 20 hours a day and weekends ?

461
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:04,937
To get ulcers and pull my hair
out and worry and doubt myself

462
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:06,638
and then at the end of it all,

463
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,440
have the rug pulled out from under me ?

464
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,109
I love being a Professor, okay ?

465
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,311
All that stupid crap they tell you

466
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,779
about how fulfilling teaching is ?

467
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,114
It's all true.

468
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:18,183
I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that.

469
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,735
My answer's no.

470
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,958
Hey, guys.

471
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,359
Where's the poop, Robin ?

472
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,627
How do you do that ?

473
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:31,046
You are like a bomb-sniffing
dog, except with poop.

474
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,581
You are a poop-sniffing dog.

475
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:34,616
I think that's just called a dog.

476
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:36,418
Where's the poop, Robin ?

477
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,338
Fine. I called don again.

478
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:43,092
Hey, Don ! It's Robin again.

479
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,177
Look, I am sorry for all the calls.

480
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:46,812
It's just, I saw you on the news,

481
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,931
and it made me a little crazy for a minute.

482
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,385
I guess I wasn't as over
our breakup as I thought.

483
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,254
But I want to say,

484
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:57,389
from the bottom of my heart,

485
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,108
I am going to kill you.

486
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:00,242
No... no, I'm not.

487
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:02,528
I am happy for you.

488
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:05,330
And that asian slut on your Facebook page.

489
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:07,483
She's dead, too.

490
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:09,952
I thought you deleted his number.

491
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:12,004
I did, but it turns out, I memorized it.

492
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:14,339
You can't delete contacts
from your brain, Lily.

493
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,574
Well, you have to try.

494
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:16,992
If you ever want to have closure...

495
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:18,594
I am never going to have closure.

496
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:20,929
Okay ? Closure doesn't exist.

497
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,015
Okay, one day, Don and I
are moving in together,

498
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:24,216
and the next thing I know,

499
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:26,084
he's on a plane to Chicago.

500
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,937
It just... ended.

501
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:32,307
And no matter how much I try
to forget that it happened,

502
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:34,776
it will have never not happened.

503
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:36,912
Don and I will always be a loose end.

504
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:38,730
We'll always be...

505
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:41,066
Unfinished.

506
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:45,637
Gaudi, to his credit,
never gave up on his dream,

507
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,656
but that's not usually how it goes.

508
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:50,159
I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus

509
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,462
that keeps the brown, pointy,
weird church from getting built.

510
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:56,198
Most of the time, it's just too difficult

511
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:59,134
or too expensive, or too scary.

512
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:02,254
It's only once you've stopped

513
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:05,757
that you realize how hard
it is to start again.

514
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:09,628
So you force yourself not to want it.

515
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:11,230
But it's always there.

516
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,016
And until you finish it, it will always be...

517
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,418
Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel.

518
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,004
Rachel, why aren't you in class ?

519
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,222
Why aren't you in class ?

520
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:40,209
Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class ?

521
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:46,798
You son of a bitch.

522
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:49,551
I'll call Marshall.

523
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:50,969
We'll draw up the contract.

524
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,221
Not so fast.

525
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:53,838
I'm not that easy.

526
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,642
And so I made Barney break his golden rule.

527
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,277
I made him take me out to dinner

528
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:02,731
before I finally gave him
the thing he always got.

529
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:04,349
Yes.

530
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:08,420
And even though it didn't happen right away...

531
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,856
And now, the 11:00 news with Don Frank.

532
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:17,095
Man
¿ Bueno ?

533
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:18,914
Who is this ?

534
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:20,499
No hablo inglés.

535
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,900
¿ Quién es ?

536
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,486
I'm sorry. Is this 917-456...

537
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:26,555
I'm sorry, 465...

538
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,123
No, wait.

539
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:33,178
Robin finally got some closure, too.

540
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,097
Sorry. Wrong number.

541
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,036
Finished with that.

542
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:54,147
Hey, punk !

543
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:55,498
Bit of advice.

544
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:58,969
Next time you step on a
kindergarten teacher's neck,

545
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,338
you better finish the job.

546
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,839
I knew this day would come.
