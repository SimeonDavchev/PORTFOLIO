1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,134
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2010,</i>

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,402
<i>I was hosting my very first Thanksgiving.</i>

3
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,538
<i>And I wanted it to be unforgettable.</i>

4
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:09,942
Instead of stuffing,
I'm going to fill the turkey with...

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,661
a slightly smaller turkey.

6
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:14,080
It's called a Turturkeykey !

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,248
A Turturkeykey ? Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,085
Uh-uh, oh-oh. ROBIN: Yeah, I was there for

9
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,254
the "insertion". He used shoehorns.

10
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,422
I'll be having sides.

11
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,058
Your loss. All right, it's dead in here.

12
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,693
I'm gonna call it a little early.

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,378
What ? No ! You can't go now.

14
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:31,097
It's the night before Thanksgiving.

15
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,465
College chicks are back in town.

16
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,933
Their moms just made a snide comment

17
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,468
about the weight they gained.

18
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,602
They called her a bitch,

19
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,937
but deep down, they know she's right.

20
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,488
And they're about to walk through that door,

21
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:40,890
where we will be waiting

22
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:44,443
with some light beer and
some rock hard approval.

23
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,812
Wh-what u-up ?

24
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,447
Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man.

25
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,649
You could become The Blitz.

26
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,985
<i>Blitz was a guy we knew in college.</i>

27
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,387
<i>Sadly, he was cursed.</i>

28
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,855
Well...

29
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,256
I'm calling it a little early.

30
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,558
Wh... you sure ? We got big plans.

31
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,827
Yeah. Remember how last
week we fired up a sandwich,

32
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,529
<i>and we listened to Pink Floyd's
Dark Side of the Moon</i>

33
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,964
<i>while watching The Wizard of Oz ?</i>

34
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:05,965
Well, tonight,

35
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,100
we're doing the same thing,

36
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,136
<i>only with "Weird Al"
Yankovic's Greatest Hits</i>

37
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,937
<i>and Apocalypse Now.</i>

38
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,706
We'll see what happens.

39
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:17,093
Nah, it's Kraft/Croft night:
mac and cheese and Tomb Raider.

40
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:18,761
Biz-zow !

41
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:21,213
<i>You see, every time Blitz left a place,</i>

42
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,481
<i>something amazing happened.</i>

43
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,453
Oh ! I'm sorry.

44
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,088
I thought this was my room.

45
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:34,894
Completely naked ! Completely naked !

46
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,362
Aw, man !

47
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,997
And the movie was awesome.

48
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,532
Aw, man !

49
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,300
At the exact moment Brando first appeared,

50
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,869
"Weird Al" launched right into "Eat It".

51
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,038
<i>Aw, man !</i>

52
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,573
<i>And over the years,</i>

53
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,809
<i>"The Curse of The Blitz" continued.</i>

54
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,677
Well, I'm gonna call it.

55
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,480
I just got Madden 2K1,
and I can't stop thinking about it.

56
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,514
See you later ! Bye-bye !

57
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,549
All right, bye-bye ! Okay, later !

58
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,750
Good-bye ! Bye-Bye !

59
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,723
Tap's broke ! Can't turn 'em off !

60
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,224
Free beer for everyone !

61
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,261
Free beer for everyone !

62
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,763
Free beer for everyone !

63
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,299
Aw, man !

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,401
You know what ?

65
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,470
Ted, go ahead... leave early
to do something lame.

66
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,473
Just don't blame us if
you become... The Blitz.

67
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,974
All right, first of all...

68
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,810
there's nothing lame about
brining a Turturkeykey,

69
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,079
copyright pending. And secondly,

70
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,782
I don't believe
"The Curse of The Blitz" is real.

71
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,318
<i>Kids, I'd live to regret those words.</i>

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,253
<i>You see, the "Curse of Blitz"
could be passed</i>

73
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,655
<i>from one person to the next, at any moment.</i>

74
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,457
<i>Blitz had gotten the curse
from Jerry Windheim,</i>

75
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,893
<i>back in freshman year,
who got it years before that</i>

76
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,428
<i>from Davey Beaterman.</i>

77
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,796
<i>The original Blitz, Matt Blitz,</i>

78
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,165
<i>was a guy who went to Wesleyan
back in the '60s.</i>

79
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,934
<i>He dropped out right before
the school went co-ed.</i>

80
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,203
<i>And then, Thanksgiving morning...</i>

81
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,177
What the hell happened here ?

82
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,246
Hey ! Morning, Blitz !

83
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,248
Aw, man !

84
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,999
No, no ! Let's get one thing straight, okay ?

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,317
I am not The Blitz.

86
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:09,522
# My Blitzy lies over the ocean #

87
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,025
# My Blitzy lies over the sea #

88
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:17,296
# My Blitzy lies over the ocean #

89
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,332
# So bring back my Blitzy... # Please stop.

90
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,402
Okay, fine.

91
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,770
# To me. #

92
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,239
The Gentleman !

93
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,875
The Gentleman ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait !

94
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,043
What's that ? What's "The Gentleman" ?

95
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,112
Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes.

96
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,313
I'm not The Blitz !

97
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,358
Zoey ?

98
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,479
Morning, Blitz !

99
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,561
<i>Kids, you remember Zoey.</i>

100
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:06,929
For the last two months,

101
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,630
she'd been making my life hell.

102
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,966
Thanks, guys !

103
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,468
Last night was amazing !

104
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:13,769
The Gentleman !

105
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,771
The Gentle...

106
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:20,943
How could you, my best friends in the world,

107
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:23,045
hang out with my mortal enemy,

108
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:27,082
then let her sleep in the
tub where I clean myself ?!

109
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,067
Sorry, Ted. We can explain.

110
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,253
After you Blitzed out last night...

111
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:32,554
I'm not The Blitz !

112
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:33,789
Oh, my God...

113
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,257
That's Zoey !

114
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:36,859
That's Ted's enemy.

115
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,361
Which means she's our enemy.

116
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,197
Let's take this bitch down.

117
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,799
Huh ? Huh ?

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Who's got your back ?

119
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:45,834
Now let's have dinner !

120
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:48,503
Finish the story, Red.

121
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:51,640
Okay, well, we all started brainstorming

122
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,975
ways to mess with her.

123
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,544
There were a lot of different
ideas kicking around.

124
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,313
And then I'm just going to
leave her there... buck-naked,

125
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:01,450
covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.

126
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,221
Barney, I know that Ted
doesn't like that girl,

127
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,590
but that's a little extreme.

128
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:10,425
Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl ?

129
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,427
Okay. Wh... ?

130
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:13,629
Well, I got it.

131
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,930
You see that silk scarf ?

132
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:16,999
I'm going to steal it.

133
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:23,839
Can I... help you ?

134
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,176
Yeah. Yeah !

135
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:29,378
My name is Lily Aldrin.

136
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,847
I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's,
so you better...

137
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,183
You're Lily Aldrin ? The painter ?!

138
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:35,851
Well, yeah.

139
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,619
You're amazing !

140
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,821
I bought a bunch of your paintings online.

141
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:41,790
That was you ?! Yeah.

142
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,909
Oh ! Thanks !

143
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,429
Look, none of us meant for
it to happen, but, well,

144
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,765
we had an awesome night with her.

145
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:53,401
The Gentleman !

146
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,707
<i>And then, the craziest thing happened.</i>

147
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:04,746
I missed a skateboarding dog ?

148
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,648
Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.

149
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,217
It wasn't ?

150
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,351
Okay, Marshall.

151
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,303
Truth or dare ?

152
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,521
Okay, awesome.

153
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,189
Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths.

154
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:15,991
So, dare.

155
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:17,359
Okay.

156
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,096
I dare you to send a picture of your junk

157
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:22,831
to a complete stranger.

158
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,736
Best idea ever !

159
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,905
Worst idea ever !

160
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,990
My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket.

161
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,477
If there phone was on vibrate,
I basically dry-humped them.

162
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,113
Ho, ho, ho, ho ! Whoa ! Yay !

163
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:39,781
Yeah. Okay.

164
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,049
Everybody shout out random numbers.

165
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,551
Um. 4, 8...

166
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:44,820
15, 16, 23, 42 !

167
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,788
And... send !

168
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:49,791
Wait. Blitz was there, too ?

169
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:53,061
The Gentleman ! The Gentleman !

170
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:54,796
Oh, I was there for the whole thing.

171
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:55,864
Something inside me just said

172
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:58,767
"Grand Theft Auto" can wait a night.

173
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,602
It was legen...

174
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,487
wait for Ted to leave,
'cause he's now The Blitz...

175
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,823
dary. Legendary !

176
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,108
I'm not The Blitz !

177
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:07,409
I'm afraid you are, Ted.

178
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,378
You see, when you left last night,

179
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,613
you changed the course of Blitztory.

180
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:20,372
<i>Blitz...</i>

181
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,272
I'm finally free ! I mean, you have no idea

182
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:39,508
what I've missed all these years:

183
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:40,676
The university president's toupee

184
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:43,845
being snatched by a hawk at graduation,

185
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:45,981
Zeppelin reuniting at my
cousin Ira's bar mitzvah,

186
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:49,618
countless nip-slips, crotch shots,

187
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,353
shooting stars and double rainbows.

188
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:52,721
I've missed them all !

189
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,357
Well, not anymore, Blitz.

190
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,192
My name's not Blitz.

191
00:07:57,193 --> 00:08:00,395
My name is Steve !

192
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:04,366
Colors seem so bright now.

193
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,205
Thank you, Blitz. What ? No !

194
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:12,341
N- n-n-n-no ! N-n-no ! I'm not The Blitz !

195
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:14,593
The only thing I missed last
night was my best friends

196
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,212
stabbing me in the back by
hanging out with my worst enemy.

197
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:18,680
Guys !

198
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,115
I hate Zoey !

199
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:21,883
That means you're supposed to hate her, too !

200
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,385
Th-that's your rule, Lily !

201
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:24,720
I tried.

202
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:25,921
Tried ?!

203
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,789
Lily, do you have any idea

204
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,025
how many people I've blindly hated for you ?

205
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:33,795
I hated Renée Zellweger
with a burning passion

206
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,130
for eight years,

207
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,132
only to discover you
meant Reese Witherspoon !

208
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:40,235
Hey, I will hate her
until I get my money back

209
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,603
<i>for You, Me and Dupree !</i>

210
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,138
That's Kate Hudson !

211
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,173
Oh, yeah. That's who I hate.

212
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:46,575
Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.

213
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,077
No, we hate Zoey !

214
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,913
I'm so furious at you all right now,

215
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:54,950
but it's Thanksgiving,
and I have a Turturkeykey to make.

216
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,186
And not that I'm The Blitz,

217
00:08:58,187 --> 00:09:01,089
but could everyone please
come with me into the kitchen ?

218
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,227
Okay, I'm, uh,

219
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:07,062
just gonna preheat the oven.

220
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,897
The oven.

221
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,232
Hey, Robin,

222
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,667
you should dance on the oven.

223
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,904
Make out with Zoey !

224
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:19,074
Make out with Zoey ! Make out...

225
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:28,016
Did they tell you about
the skateboarding dog ?

226
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,586
It was awesome !

227
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:38,007
Great. So not only did you guys betray me,

228
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:40,376
but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving ?

229
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:41,477
Full disclosure.

230
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,412
We also used all your butter,
greasing up Lily

231
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:46,348
so we could see how far we
could slide her down the hall.

232
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:49,652
But if it helps, I reached 4G.

233
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:52,488
It doesn't help. 4G ?

234
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:53,489
Mm-hmm.

235
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,623
No.

236
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:56,492
What-What are we supposed to do now ?

237
00:09:57,494 --> 00:09:59,795
This is awesome !

238
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:02,431
I'm part of this !

239
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:03,732
Barney, I don't know

240
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,101
if the oven is deep enough. Plus,

241
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:09,772
it's a display made of cardboard.

242
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:12,341
Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.

243
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,277
Hey, just so you guys know,

244
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:17,946
there was a tiny explosion
at the sewage treatment plant

245
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:19,615
across the street from our apartment,

246
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:21,517
but I'm sure it's fine by now.

247
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:22,885
This is awesome !

248
00:10:22,886 --> 00:10:24,019
It's not awesome !

249
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,056
I think the smaller turkey just tried

250
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:30,359
to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.

251
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:33,562
Um...

252
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:36,732
Um... I'm have...

253
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,951
I'm having trouble breathing !

254
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,904
Mom keeps an extra litter box in here.

255
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:45,574
There you go.

256
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:47,209
Good as new.

257
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:50,345
Oh. Hey, Ginger.

258
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,600
Ted, you're not gonna like this,

259
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,468
but we do have one other option.

260
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:59,021
Hey, you guys

261
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,123
should come to my house for Thanksgiving.

262
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:03,592
My husband always spends
it with his daughter,

263
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:05,194
so I'm going to be alone anyway.

264
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:06,779
Could we bring Ted ?

265
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,631
It's Thanksgiving.

266
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:10,733
What the hell ?

267
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:16,789
No. Absolutely not.

268
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,624
Come on. Give her a chance.

269
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,442
Ted, you violated a dead turkey

270
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:22,161
with another dead turkey.

271
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:23,912
Don't let that be in vain.

272
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,948
Guys ? Wait a minute.

273
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:27,416
Where's Barney ?

274
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:31,754
And here's the twist, Babaka.

275
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:36,325
Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz !

276
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:38,560
But Barney, now you left the group.

277
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:41,430
Wouldn't that put you in danger
of becoming The Blitz yourself ?

278
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,198
No. I c...

279
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,300
Because...

280
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:47,436
Step on it.

281
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:50,856
You missed it.

282
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:51,940
Oh, my goodness.

283
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:53,242
Our cab took a wrong turn.

284
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:55,210
We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade !

285
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:58,247
Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike
and he sang "Twist and Shout !"

286
00:11:58,248 --> 00:11:59,832
But he's The Blitz.

287
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,951
No. I'm not The Blitz.

288
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:04,319
I'm The Bueller.

289
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:06,255
You know what this means.

290
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:07,923
You're The Blitz.

291
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:12,377
<i>Blitz...</i>

292
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:15,964
Oh, God, no !

293
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:17,382
Life moves pretty fast, Barney.

294
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,668
If you don't stop and look
around once in a while,

295
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:20,969
you might miss it.

296
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:23,305
Chicka-chicka !

297
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:27,860
Happy Thanksgiving !

298
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,179
Ted.

299
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,713
Zoey.

300
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:36,485
Best friend alert !

301
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:42,090
Okay, the Turturkeykey
is officially cooking.

302
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:43,859
Oh, God, that is disgusting !

303
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,162
Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.

304
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,463
No... no, Ted.

305
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:50,899
Random number guy just
sent me his wang back.

306
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,134
Wow.

307
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:55,554
You sent a wang out,
and you got a wang back.

308
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,738
It's a boom-a-wang.

309
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:58,207
Nice. Thank you.

310
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,775
No, I meant the wang.

311
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:01,577
Barney, could you get me some more ice ?

312
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:03,679
Sure.

313
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,714
But... no one move while I'm gone.

314
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:07,216
I'm scared.

315
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:08,183
You're safe.

316
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:09,568
It's okay to leave the room.

317
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,119
You have to actually leave the building

318
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,254
for something cool to happen.

319
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:13,755
Thanks.

320
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:16,625
You're the only one who's
nice to me about this.

321
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:20,963
Okay, I got to test this.

322
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,103
What happened ?

323
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,505
You missed it !

324
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:32,207
Dude, you walked out of the room,

325
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,777
the laws of physics stopped and
the laws of awesome tripled.

326
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:39,248
Aw, man ! You said I could leave the room !

327
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:41,383
I just wanted to see something cool happen.

328
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,285
I'm sorry.

329
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:45,554
But I was on that island for
what seems like eternity.

330
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:47,589
I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.

331
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,808
No ! Y-You...

332
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,093
Robin, Robin.

333
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:53,729
I will pay you to be The Blitz.

334
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,814
$100 ! No... $10,000.

335
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,199
No... 60 bucks.

336
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,268
That's a lot of money for someone like you.

337
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,371
Dude, The Blitz isn't something
that can be bought or sold.

338
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:04,273
Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.

339
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:05,540
Oh, what was that ?

340
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,442
I was distracted by the four-caret diamond

341
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:09,111
your 53-year-old husband bought you.

342
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:10,312
Facial !

343
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:11,513
Now, if you'll excuse me,

344
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:13,315
I have a turturkeykey to baste.

345
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:14,416
I'm coming with you.

346
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,752
No... I baste alone.

347
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,453
Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.

348
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:20,422
Word play. Loving it.

349
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:21,490
But relax.

350
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:22,491
I've got a ton of sides

351
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:23,959
to heat up since my plans fell through.

352
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,560
Who canceled ? Your coven ?

353
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,996
Coven. Group of witches. Boom.

354
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:30,666
Yeah. They were worn out from
putting that spell on your hair.

355
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,267
Oh ! Serve returned.

356
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,535
Are you happy ?

357
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:34,870
You're ruining Thanksgiving.

358
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:36,471
Well, you're not exactly who I thought

359
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,040
I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.

360
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,193
God, I'm so happy to be here.

361
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,478
My face hurts from smiling.

362
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,146
Oh... I'm sorry, Lily.

363
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:46,782
I'm just never going to like that woman.

364
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,200
Ted, give her a chance.

365
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:49,551
Enemies can't become friends.

366
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:50,886
Yes, they can.

367
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:51,920
Right, guys ?

368
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,323
No, no, no. You guys can't be objective.

369
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:56,658
You still feel guilty about last night.

370
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:57,726
Well, let's get an outside opinion.

371
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:58,760
Who are we gonna...

372
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:00,495
"Dear Wang Guy..." Oh.

373
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:03,398
"Can enemies ever be friends ?

374
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,000
Just wondering".

375
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,501
Really ?

376
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:09,237
Wang Guy ? We're asking Wang Guy ?

377
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,772
He's bold and uninhibited,

378
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:12,140
so why not ?

379
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:15,410
And guys, you know what ? For fun,
why don't we ask him

380
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:17,179
what he does for a living ?

381
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,181
Wouldn't that be fun ?

382
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:20,849
Just ask... Aww.

383
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,385
You've got a little crush
on Wang Guy, don't you ?

384
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:25,787
What ? No. Shut up.

385
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:27,155
I hate him.

386
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:28,190
Oh, look.

387
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,925
We got an answer. Here it is.

388
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:32,995
"Yes, enemies can become friends.

389
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,697
"Remember what Gandhi said.

390
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:38,467
'Be the change you want
to see in the world'".

391
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:41,136
Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi ?

392
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:42,871
That is amazing.

393
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:44,389
And I was here for it.

394
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,376
Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha !

395
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:49,878
Burn on her.

396
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:52,247
Come on, man.

397
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:54,082
<i>Don't be that Blitz.</i>

398
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,784
I'm not any Blitz !

399
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:56,952
You're The Blitz !

400
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,553
You're all The Blitz !

401
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:01,590
I slept with that cute
Indian girl who cuts my hair !

402
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:03,458
What does that have to do with anything ?

403
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:04,559
Nothing ! I just forgot

404
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,496
to brag about it before !

405
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:09,831
Guys, despite the wit
and wisdom of Wang Guy,

406
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:12,200
Zoey and I are never going to be friends.

407
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,237
We're just here for her oven and that's it.

408
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:16,471
Whoa ! Oh, my God !

409
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:19,274
Did you do that on purpose ?

410
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,709
What ? No. It was an accident.

411
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,777
Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.

412
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,111
Oh, great. Real mature.

413
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,946
Yeah, well, you started it.

414
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:28,316
Just stop it !

415
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:31,653
God, can't you two just
stop fighting for one day ?

416
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:34,823
Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote

417
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:36,792
clocked out and had a beer together ?

418
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:39,828
Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry
shared a cup of coffee.

419
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,630
Lily, those are cartoon characters,

420
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:43,565
and I'm pretty sure
you're making up episodes.

421
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:46,334
And if Zoey is a cartoon character,

422
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,503
she's Cinderella's evil stepmother !

423
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:50,739
Oh, get out.

424
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,907
All of you, out !

425
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:53,475
But it's Thanksgiving.

426
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:55,310
And I'm a part of it.

427
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:56,745
Out !

428
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:02,050
Wait... Where's Barney ?

429
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:03,835
Hey, guys, the most amazing
thing just happened

430
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,320
to me in that other roo...

431
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,125
Aw, man.

432
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:15,302
I don't get it. Why'd she just

433
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:16,820
kick us out like that ?

434
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,472
<i>And then the cab driver said</i>

435
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:20,607
<i>the last thing any of us wanted to hear.</i>

436
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:21,942
Where to ?

437
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,947
I guess we're going home.

438
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,653
Yeah. I don't know where that is.

439
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:44,431
Lily, where'd you get that ?

440
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:46,500
Oh.

441
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:47,768
When Zoey booted us,

442
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,237
it made me want to steal
something of hers again.

443
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:53,891
Apartment full of designer labels,
and what do I grab ?

444
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:57,478
"Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey".

445
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:00,347
I wonder who Hannah is.

446
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:06,720
Hey, you guys should come to
my house for Thanksgiving.

447
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:07,821
My husband always

448
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:08,956
spends it with his daughter,

449
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,557
so I'm going to be alone, anyway.

450
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:11,992
Well, you're not exactly who I thought

451
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:13,627
I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.

452
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,629
And if Zoey is a cartoon character,

453
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,798
she's Cinderella's evil stepmother !

454
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,700
Get out !

455
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:21,268
All of you, out !

456
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,723
We have to go back to Zoey's.

457
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:30,010
You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy.

458
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:34,882
Oh, God.

459
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:37,084
What are you doing here ?

460
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:38,552
Barney let us in.

461
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:40,587
Barney was here ?

462
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:41,755
I was walking around half-naked.

463
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:43,657
Aw, man !

464
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:45,793
Wait. Which half ?

465
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:48,112
Look, I'm sorry your
stepdaughter didn't want

466
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:49,730
to spend Thanksgiving with you.

467
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:51,365
How do you know that ?

468
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:52,699
I just do.

469
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,268
It must be tough.

470
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:58,038
It was the first Thanksgiving
Hannah agreed to spend with me,

471
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,875
and then at the last minute,
she changed her mind.

472
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,311
She hates my guts.

473
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,414
I get that.

474
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:11,585
Uh, you should hang on to this.

475
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,137
You can give it to her next year.

476
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:15,722
Yeah...

477
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:17,191
Right.

478
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:19,393
Next year.

479
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:20,694
Hey, you never know.

480
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:22,763
People don't stay enemies forever.

481
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,034
And that's the story of how
Zoey and I became friends.

482
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,068
Cheers.

483
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,570
Cheers.

484
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:30,604
Before we eat,

485
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:31,872
we should take a group picture

486
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:33,307
and send it to Wang Guy.

487
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:34,408
Ooh. Oh. Great idea.

488
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,342
All right.

489
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:37,478
Okay.

490
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,679
Here we go.

491
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,614
One, two, three.

492
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:45,519
Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey

493
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,820
I have ever seen.

494
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:48,222
Yeah. Yeah.

495
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:49,690
Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes

496
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:50,691
as good as it looks.

497
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,025
<i>It didn't.</i>

498
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:54,094
<i>It tasted wrong.</i>

499
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:55,345
Oops. We forgot to light the candles.

500
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:57,865
Oh. Oh, yeah.

501
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,733
<i>And just as Barney looked away,</i>

502
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:01,969
<i>it happened.</i>

503
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,932
The Gentleman !

504
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,635
What happened ? I saw it !

505
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,021
Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad.

506
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:40,207
Aw, man.

507
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:44,994
Oh, go ahead.

508
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,329
I forgot my jacket.

509
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,498
Oh, hold the door !

510
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:56,739
Thank you, God !

511
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,608
Aw, man !

512
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,076
<i>Blitz.</i>
