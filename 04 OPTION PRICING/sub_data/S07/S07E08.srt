1
00:00:01,452 --> 00:00:03,402
<i>Kids, for years, your Uncle Barney</i>

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,945
had reveled in mocking
Aunt Robin's Canadian heritage.

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,597
To have to grow up
in Canada...

4
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:10,614
with America right there.

5
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:13,034
It's like an entire country
without a tailor.

6
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:16,804
Why? Why do we let
you be a country?!

7
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:21,625
<i>But all that was about
to change.</i>

8
00:00:21,627 --> 00:00:23,127
I was on Facebook.

9
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,513
Nobody cool's
on Facebook anymore.

10
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,432
Well, you know who is
on Facebook now?

11
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:28,983
Everybody's parents.

12
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:31,469
And I just happen
to be friends

13
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,637
with Barney's long-lost father,

14
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:35,139
Mr. Jerome Whitaker.
- Me, too.

15
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:36,774
He's gotten really good
at Bejeweled Blitz.

16
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:40,828
And guess who thought my status
update about Manitoba was

17
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,033
so interesting because his
mother was born in Manitoba?

18
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:47,368
What?

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,653
Which means your grandmother...

20
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:50,555
No...

21
00:00:50,557 --> 00:00:51,672
Which makes you...

22
00:00:51,674 --> 00:00:52,874
Don't say it!

23
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:53,925
...one-quarter Canadian!

24
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:58,546
Welcome to the tribe, hoser!

25
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:00,631
No...

26
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:02,767
it's not true!

27
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,685
That's impossible!

28
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:25,240
<i>Once upon a time
at a Halloween party,</i>

29
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:27,641
<i>I met a girl
dressed like a pumpkin...</i>

30
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:28,642
<i>a slutty pumpkin.</i>

31
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:30,861
<i>And she was extraordinary.</i>

32
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:33,581
<i>But she gave me her number
on a Kit Kat bar,</i>

33
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,916
<i>which was tragically given away
as Halloween candy.</i>

34
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:37,868
<i>So every year I return
to that same party</i>

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,420
<i>hoping I'd see her again.</i>

36
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:43,607
<i>But with every passing October,
that hope grew a little dimmer.</i>

37
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:46,577
<i>Then one day, after ten years
of searching...</i>

38
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,662
Oh, my God.

39
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:50,931
The slutty pumpkin.

40
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,834
This might sound creepy,
but do you have a record

41
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:55,503
of who rented it in 2001?

42
00:01:58,523 --> 00:01:59,840
Wow, that was easy.

43
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:01,725
You're not the first lovelorn
young man

44
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:02,843
to walk through that door.

45
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:05,146
Three girls got proposals off

46
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:08,065
my wife's slutty artichoke
costume.

47
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:11,402
Two others disappeared,
but I focus on the positive.

48
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:14,121
<i>I couldn't believe it.
I actually had her address.</i>

49
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:16,340
<i>I knew I had
to play this right.</i>

50
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:20,044
<i>It's not like I could just walk
up and knock on her door.</i>

51
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:27,034
Hi, you probably
don't remember me, but...

52
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:29,536
Halloween, ten years ago.

53
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:32,807
Now that's a slow play.

54
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:36,710
<i>The next day,
Lily and Marshall headed out</i>

55
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:38,229
<i>to Lily's grandparents
for dinner.</i>

56
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,214
<i>Marshall loved it
out in the 'burbs.</i>

57
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:41,882
Look how many fireflies
I caught!

58
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:45,052
Don't forget to poke holes
in the jar this time.

59
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:48,889
Now we have
a nice surprise for you.

60
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:52,276
Whatever it is,
we're saying no.

61
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:54,411
- What?
- You know what.

62
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:55,663
Every time we're here,

63
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:57,948
my grandparents stick us with
some big old piece of junk

64
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,399
they're getting rid of.

65
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:02,253
It's like the world's worst
Showcase Showdown.

66
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:05,956
It's a perfectly
usable lawnmower!

67
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:08,926
We live in an apartment!

68
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,177
But maybe someday

69
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:11,629
when we move to the suburbs...

70
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:13,464
We're never moving
to the suburbs!

71
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:14,548
And you also get...

72
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,051
this skinny microphone!

73
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:18,802
Oh!

74
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:22,256
Before we head out
to our place in Florida,

75
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,775
we wanted to give
our favorite granddaughter

76
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:26,443
a little something.

77
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:30,781
Ooh, it's so small.
I love it!

78
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:33,284
- A key?
- We're giving you the house.

79
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:37,071
Lily, I know you've
always hated the suburbs...

80
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:39,707
We'll take it!

81
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,493
<i>For my first date
with the slutty pumpkin,</i>

82
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:44,128
<i>I took her someplace special.</i>

83
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,779
Ted, this is so romantic.

84
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:47,715
The spot where
we first met

85
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:49,416
ten years ago.

86
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:51,502
Do you remember the song
that was playing that night?

87
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:54,255
I remember how beautiful
you looked.

88
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:56,957
♪ It's been one week
since you looked at me ♪

89
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,894
♪ Cocked your head to the side
and said, "I'm angry." ♪

90
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:01,845
Is that, uh,
the Barenaked Ladies, huh?

91
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,514
♪ Five days since you laughed
at me ♪

92
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:05,733
♪ Saying, "Get that together.
Come back and see me." ♪

93
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:09,987
<i>Kids, it took me ten years,
but I finally kissed her.</i>

94
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,473
<i>And it was... terrible.</i>

95
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:22,154
Lily, you hate the suburbs.

96
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,737
I know, but my grandparents
giving us a house

97
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:26,272
right when
the baby's on the way?

98
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:27,389
It's perfect timing.

99
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,408
This is great.
I'm finally gonna be able

100
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,727
to barbecue with
proper ventilation.

101
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:34,614
Marshall!

102
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:37,116
We're moving
to the suburbs, baby!

103
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:39,118
Oh...

104
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,621
Okay.

105
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:43,506
Baby, you're not moving
to the suburbs.

106
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:44,457
Why not?

107
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,841
Lily is only agreeing

108
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,593
to all this because
of Pregnancy Brain.

109
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,679
Pregnancy Brain?
That's not a thing.

110
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:50,913
It's totally a thing.

111
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:55,551
Her brain is marinating in
a cocktail of hormones,

112
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:58,137
mood swings and jacked-up
nesting instincts.

113
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,440
I mean, yes, right now
Lily is a goddess

114
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,192
bestowing the
miracle of life,

115
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:05,728
but damn, she dumb!

116
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,065
Well, I have noticed some stuff.

117
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,901
I can't find my keys
or wallet anywhere!

118
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:13,936
I found them...

119
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,438
here in the freezer.

120
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,407
Hey, but where are
the ice cube trays?

121
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:20,526
No idea.

122
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:25,948
Those poor ice cubes!

123
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,968
I guess she has been
a little off lately.

124
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,803
A little? She just texted me

125
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:33,656
wanting directions back
from the bathroom.

126
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:37,176
Oh. We're over here!

127
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:40,062
You're doing great, sweetie!

128
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:43,132
That moron should not be making
big life decisions right now.

129
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,767
If you let her move
to the suburbs,

130
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:46,819
it would be like taking
advantage

131
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:48,354
of a helpless drunk chick.

132
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:50,573
What? Where?!

133
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:53,242
Oh, I got a girlfriend, right.

134
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:57,330
Baby, we should put
off moving.

135
00:05:57,332 --> 00:05:58,331
Why?

136
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,082
Because I think
the pregnancy is

137
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,167
affecting your judgment.

138
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,655
No, Marshall, this is
an amazing opportunity

139
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,990
that we have
to take advantage of!

140
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,593
Just because my body
is growing a fungus...

141
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:12,094
Fetus.

142
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:13,362
...doesn't mean that my metal
factories...

143
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:15,097
Mental faculties.

144
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,183
...are in any way funicular.

145
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:20,353
No idea.

146
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:24,890
Mmm...

147
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,342
This is nice.
What is this?

148
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,509
Canadian whiskey.

149
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:32,014
I want scotch!

150
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:36,402
American scotch
from Scotland!

151
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:38,854
Get that swill
away from me!

152
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:44,126
Why are you doing
this to me?

153
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:45,995
You have been ripping
on Canada

154
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:48,530
since Justin Bieber was
knee-high to a snow blower.

155
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:51,533
So now this Canuck's
gonna beat on you

156
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:54,387
like the drummer from Yukon
Blonde hopped up on Timbits.

157
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,639
- Hey.
- Hey!

158
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:57,590
How was your

159
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:59,392
big date with
the Snuffy Tuffkin?

160
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:00,709
The Sniffy Napkin?

161
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,263
The Slouchy Foreskin?

162
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:05,547
Lily tie-tie.

163
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:09,151
It was good... ish.

164
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,721
Look, there's Orion's Belt.

165
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,989
Oh.

166
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:16,108
<i>Why does holding hands feel
this weird?</i>

167
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,277
<i>Should our fingers
not intertwine?</i>

168
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,530
<i>What's causing that
pinching feeling?</i>

169
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:23,732
<i>I'll just cup her hand.</i>

170
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,068
<i>There. That's...</i>

171
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,087
<i>not great.</i>

172
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,910
<i>Her hair's up my nose.</i>

173
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,431
<i>Her shoulder's jabbing
into my windpipe.</i>

174
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,182
<i>Maybe if we reposition.</i>

175
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:46,755
I have to say something.

176
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,274
She must be feeling it, too.

177
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,092
This feels so right.

178
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,895
We fit like two puzzle pieces.

179
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:54,113
Yeah.

180
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:57,483
Ted, I know you've waited
ten years for this girl,

181
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:59,601
but some things
just aren't meant to be.

182
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:01,737
Not so fast.
At the end of the night,

183
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:04,540
when I leaned in and somehow
accidentally kissed

184
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:07,543
her open eyeball, there was a
slight flicker of something

185
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:10,629
I might even call chemistry...

186
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:12,131
adjacent.

187
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,283
Thank you.

188
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,801
Wait.

189
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,888
Where is my cash?

190
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,473
Oh, yeah,

191
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:23,175
I did a little exchange
for ya, Canucklehead.

192
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:26,595
This Canadian dollar here
is called a "loonie."

193
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:30,983
And this two-dollar coin?
A "toonie." True story.

194
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:34,153
It's federal currency
and you people talk about it

195
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:36,188
like it's a Hannah-
Barbera character.

196
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,108
Not you people, Barney.

197
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,609
Our people.

198
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:43,078
<i>Even though my first date
with Naomi was</i>

199
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,246
<i>a little awkward,</i>

200
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:46,315
<i>our second date was
a lot awkward.</i>

201
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,750
Mmm...!

202
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:50,786
<i>This is the worst
kissing of all time!</i>

203
00:08:50,788 --> 00:08:51,820
Mmm...

204
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,622
<i>How could she possibly
be into this?</i>

205
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,958
<i>She sounds like
those cows in</i>

206
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,326
<i>Temple Grandin's
hug machines.</i>

207
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,595
Do you want to listen
to some music?

208
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:00,446
Uh-huh!

209
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,637
Ted, this is our song.

210
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,773
Let's make love to this song.

211
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,560

212
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:16,178

213
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,646

214

<i>♪ X-Files with no lights on,

215
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Hey, doofus!

216
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:26,322
It's me:
you at age 15.

217
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:27,540
And we made a deal

218
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:30,876
we would always boink any chick
that wants to boink us!

219
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:32,127
Yes, she's beautiful,

220
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,463
it's just there's
no connection there.

221
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:36,031
I don't feel intimate with her.

222
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,833
"Intimate"? Let me remind you
of some things

223
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:40,169
you did feel "intimate" with
when you were 15:

224
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,303
a catcher's mitt,

225
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:43,872
an oven mitt,
a glass of warm water,

226
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,510
a half-open hide-a-bed sofa,
a top-loading VCR!

227
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:48,761
It's not gonna happen!

228
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:51,397
Come on!

229
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,567
It'll take, like, 30 seconds!

230
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:57,403
Naomi, listen...

231
00:09:57,405 --> 00:10:00,406
Shh...

232
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:04,577
You like that, Ted?

233
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:05,744
Hmm.

234
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:09,281
Do you ike it
when I caress your hair?

235
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:12,734
Your hair is
so nice to caress.

236
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,837
<i>Why is she saying that word?</i>

237
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,289
I like to caress your hair.

238
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:21,126
<i>There it is again! "Caress!"
Who says that?</i>

239
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:24,129
Caress.

240
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,749
The thing is,
I like her, okay?

241
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,852
I really, really like her.

242
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:33,022
I just don't seem to like
anything she says or does.

243
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:35,774
I have to break up
with her, don't I?

244
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:36,825
Yes!

245
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:38,861
After you sleep with her, yes!

246
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,597
Marshall, I've been thinking
about what you said.

247
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,450
You're right, we shouldn't
move to the suburbs.

248
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:47,486
Let's not make any huge life
decisions right now.

249
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:49,405
Is this because you tried
to make waffles

250
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:50,606
with the laptop this morning?

251
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,043
Anyway, I'm gonna call
a real estate broker

252
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,828
to come look at the
house tomorrow.

253
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,429
Oh, by the way,

254
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:59,582
I ordered those Minnesota
Vikings drapes.

255
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:02,801
You're right, they're totally
gonna class up our apartment.

256
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:08,524
Okay, yes. It's wrong
to bang a drunk chick.

257
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:11,627
But you're an idiot if you don't
get, like, a little something.

258
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:15,147
Yo, Canada.

259
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:17,266
What? Dammit!

260
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:19,134
Ha, you answer to "Canada" now.

261
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:22,237
I'll make you a deal.

262
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,606
You wear this costume

263
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:25,524
to the Halloween party
tomorrow night,

264
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,693
I'll drop it forever.

265
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,615
You can't be serious.

266
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:35,534
Oh, I am as serious
as a poutine shortage

267
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:38,120
in Chicoutimi during
a curling bonspiel.

268
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:41,823
I don't know what
any of those words mean.

269
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,009
Yes. You do.

270
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,016
Oh, that must be the broker.
Marshall, will you get it?

271
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,185
Sure. Of course.

272
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:56,105
Trick or treat!

273
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:58,507
Oh, my gosh. How cute!

274
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,275
I'm sorry, we don't
have any candy.

275
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:02,061
Um, we forgot about
trick-or-treaters.

276
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:03,278
We don't get any where we live.

277
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,198
Yup. Only get this
kind of cuteness

278
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,533
in the suburbs.

279
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:14,373
Oh. Look at how sweet and
happy and unarmed they all are!

280
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,543
Are you using adorable
little children in costumes

281
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:18,711
to manipulate me?
- Bye!

282
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:20,862
I mean, did you even call
a real estate broker?

283
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:22,748
No.

284
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,833

342
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,116
and end this forever,

343
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:13,985
you show up shirtless
to an outdoor party?

344
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:15,336

345
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:17,755

346
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:19,757

00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,029
There's a song and dance

357
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:42,564
that goes along with it,
but I have to

358
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,898
drink three of them
before I can do it.

359
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:47,669
Oh.
Okay. You go.

360
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:49,487
This way.

361
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:54,025
Sounds delicious.
In theory.

362
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:56,360
But you never know
until you taste it.

363
00:15:56,362 --> 00:16:00,698
Ted... have you tasted
her Tootsie Roll?

364
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,716
Of course not.

365
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:03,968
- Ow.
- Wait. Have you?

366
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:08,556
You had sex with someone you
have zero feelings for!

367
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:09,874
U-S-A!

368
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:10,925
U-S...

369
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,061
Stop it.

370
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:14,896
Just no part of it felt right.

371
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:17,181
At first there was too much
eye contact, then not enough.

372
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:19,216
Where do you look during sex?

373
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:21,853
Um, into the hidden camera
at future me watching it.

374
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:25,106
Okay. Wait. How does

375
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,358
saying "I want to break up
with you" lead into sex?

376
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,662
I didn't say "I want to
break up with you," exactly.

377
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:32,280
What did you say, exactly?

378
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,533
"I love you."

379
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:38,069
Classic Schmosby.

380
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:43,625
Marshall, this house
wants you so bad.

381
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,044
"Mow my lawn.

382
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,679
"Rake my leaves.

383
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:49,547
Winterize my pipes""

384
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:50,715
Yes!

385
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,383
Yes! I'm coming...

386
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:54,085
to terms with this decision!

387
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,020
Oh!

388
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:57,889
Trick or treat!

389
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:58,606
Yay!

390
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,808
Okay.

391
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,895
Oh.

392
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,229
Happy Halloween.

393
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:10,151
- Lily.
- Yeah?

394
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:11,619
You just gave
those children

395
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:14,772
a stapler,
a pair of sharp scissors,

396
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:17,075
and a pretty decent
Pinot Noir.

397
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,459
I did?

398
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:21,329
Oh, my God.

399
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:25,166
I'm going to miss
that stapler so much.

400
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:30,722
I'm not doing
so great, am I?

401
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:32,757
Maybe not.

402
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,595
We shouldn't make any
huge life decisions

403
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,230
right now, should we?

404
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:44,068
Hey, look, I love you and
I-I love the idea of raising

405
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,154
our kids with a lawn
and a white picket fence,

406
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:48,305
but we have our whole lives
to decide when

407
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:50,608
and if we want
to do that.

408
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,810
Do what?

409
00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:55,363
Let's get you home.

410
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:02,420
Ooh.

411
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:04,989
That's for the stapler!

412
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:07,158
I hate the suburbs.

413
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,713
Naomi...

414
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,330
We have to
end this.

415
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,331
W-- huh?

416
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,967
I'm sorry, Tootsie Rolls make me

417
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,352
really honest.

418
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:23,191
Ted... I know
you're super into me.

419
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:25,643
But we are terrible together.

420
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,311
Wait, what?

421
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:31,649
I've been trying, saying things
felt good that didn't just to...

422
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:36,120
I thought saying it was good
would make it feel good, but...

423
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:40,625
...it always felt off.

424
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:46,130
<i>Why won't he stop
sniffing my hair?</i>

425
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:47,632
<i>And what's up
with the hand holding?</i>

426
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:51,302
<i>It's like he's trying
to win a thumb war.</i>

427
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:54,538
Ted, this is our song.

428
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,225
<i>Oh, no, he thinks
I'm actually into this song.</i>

429
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,343
<i>Does he not get sarcasm?</i>

430
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:02,313
Let's make love to this song.

431
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,648
<i>I'll just be even more
ridiculous</i>

432
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,650
<i>to make it clear it's a joke.</i>

433
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:07,568
♪ Chickety-China,
the Chinese chicken... ♪

434
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,820
I...

435
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:10,988
<i>Uh-oh, where you going
with this, buddy?</i>

436
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,106
...love...

437
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,390
<i>Nope, too soon.</i>

438
00:19:13,392 --> 00:19:15,777
<i>Say basset hounds,
Pretzel Crisps, anything but...</i>

439
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,077
...you.

440
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:18,944
<i>Oh, God, just kiss him
before he proposes.</i>

441
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,001
Ted, I've been looking
for the Hot Hanging Chad

442
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:26,621
for the last nine Halloweens.

443
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,456
I've waded
through a sweaty parade

444
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,842
of Big Lebowskis, Harry Potters,

445
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:32,844
Antoine Dodsons,
and that jackass

446
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:34,679
who always dresses as laundry.

447
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,047
Oh, I hate that guy.

448
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,766
That's why,
once I finally found you...

449
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:42,937
...it was hard to let you go.

450
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:45,773
Good-bye, Ted.

451
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:52,530
Let's just not touch ever again.

452
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:53,481
Probably a good idea, yeah.

453
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,533
Okay.

454
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:58,202
<i>Kids, after spending a decade
dreaming of the wrong girl,</i>

455
00:19:58,204 --> 00:20:01,122
<i>I wanted more than ever
for the next woman I met</i>

456
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,491
<i>to be the real thing.</i>

457
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:09,664
Yeah, I don't know, Barney,
she doesn't seem like my type.

458
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,049
I will kill you.

459
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:13,384
I'll see
what I can do.

460
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,858
Oh, hey there, I'm
Barney, how are you?

461
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,162
<i>No, I'm Barney.</i>

462
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:44,498
Whoa.

463
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,450
You pack quite a wallop there.

464
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:48,485
Hope you didn't
hurt your hand.

465
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:51,321
Why are you so nice?

466
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:54,825
Oh, sorry about my
thick noodle there.

467
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:57,378
How about we split the
cost of the vase, eh?

468
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,047
Holy Zamboni.

469
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:01,932
Wow, you really put your
weight behind that one.

470
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,434
That was a
really good one.

471
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:07,526
Oh, heavens to Gretzky, that
was a real Chiclet rattler.
