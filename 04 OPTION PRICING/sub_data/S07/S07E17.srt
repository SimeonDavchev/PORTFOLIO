1
00:00:01,557 --> 00:00:03,876
Kids, I'll never forget
the first time

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,546
I told your mother I loved her.

3
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:07,564
It was a rainy day in New York.

4
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:08,916
<i>We just had a horrible lunch.</i>

5
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:10,884
<i>The movie we wanted to see
was sold out,</i>

6
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:11,969
<i>and I just looked at her</i>

7
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,871
<i>and said, "I love you."</i>

8
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:16,290
<i>It was a big deal for me.</i>

9
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:18,892
<i>I hadn't said that
to a girl since...</i>

10
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,678
I love you, Robin.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,230
I'm serious.

12
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:27,184
Do you remember why we
broke up in the first place?

13
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:28,485
We asked each other,
"Where do you want

14
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,637
<i>to be in five years?"</i>

15
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:32,856
<i>And our answers
were just too different.</i>

16
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,224
Well, it's
five years later,

17
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:37,411
and where are we?

18
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,246
Standing on the roof

19
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:42,065
<i>where I kissed you
for the first time.</i>

20
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,170
I know this is
a lot to process,

21
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:48,164
so no pressure here.

22
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:52,135
Just... what do you think?

23
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,411
You know what?
You're exhausted, it's late.

24
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:55,412
Let's just go to sleep.

25
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:56,580
Well, good night.

26
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:01,852
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

27
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,354
<i>Okay, I can fix this.</i>

28
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:07,574
<i>I-I was just temporarily insane
because of my Lyme disease,</i>

29
00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:12,579
<i>which I got on a camping trip
that I didn't tell her about</i>

30
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:17,618
<i>because... I go camping
in secret.</i>

31
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,453
<i>Perfect.</i>

32
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:21,538
<i>Or I could say, "I'm sorry,
we're great as friends.</i>

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,157
<i>Let's just forget
I ever said anything."</i>

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,158
<i>Yeah, that's probably better.</i>

35
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,243
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>

36
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:32,370
I go camping in secret.

37
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:54,529
Wow, Ted, I...
wow, okay.

38
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:56,048
You got to give
me a minute here.

39
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,602
Yeah, of course.

40
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:00,756
Okay, um, we need to
t-talk about this.

41
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:03,892
This time yesterday,
I was in Vermont

42
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,359
engaged to another man.

43
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:09,811
I mean, it's been 24 hours
of emotional mayhem,

44
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:11,846
and, and the day
is still not over.

45
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:12,778
I mean, I swear
to God,

46
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:14,495
if there's any more surprises,
I'm gonna hit someone!

47
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,719
... comrade.

48
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:20,457
That means,

49
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,396
"Hello, coworker."

50
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:24,327
You ready for our trip
to Mother Russia?

51
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:26,993
<i>Oh, yeah, Aunt Robin
was thrilled World Wide News</i>

52
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:29,302
<i>asked her to go to Moscow
to cover Maslenitsa.</i>

53
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:30,927
<i>She was less thrilled
to discover</i>

54
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,813
<i>Maslenitsa is the city's
annual butter festival.</i>

55
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:36,316
<i>Even worse, she'd spend
an entire week with all those</i>

56
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,970
<i>buttery Russians
and her archenemy Patrice.</i>

57
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:44,424
Uh, our flight leaves
at 9:00 p.m., not a.m.

58
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:46,504
God... Patrice!

59
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:49,153
But, Robin,
the schedule says 9:00 a.m.

60
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,947
and my ticket says 9:00 a.m.

61
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,083
and all the e-mail reminders
said 9:00 a.m.

62
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,702
and our boss in the car
downstairs said...

63
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:56,168
Okay, Patrice, I get it!

64
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:57,420
Oh, no!

65
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,039
Pair of pants
coming in hot!

66
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,256
Noise-canceling
headphones.

67
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:01,708
Oh, I don't need 'em.

68
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,793
It's a ten-hour flight and
your sitting next to Patrice.

69
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,809
Oh, God,
where's my cough syrup?

70
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,049
You're gonna make it.

71
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,057
I'll bring
your bag down.

72
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,771
Where are my shoes?
Where are my shoes?!

73
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:10,840
Don't worry. It's fine.

74
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,619
And look, about all this...
Just go.

75
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,084
Good-bye.
Bye.

76
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:19,462
Why didn't I kiss her?

77
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:24,143
We'll continue this
when I get back.

78
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:34,672
Hello.

79
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:35,617
I know it's early,

80
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,908
but can you meet me
at the bar right now, alone?

81
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,496
I'm on my way.

82
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,015
I got to meet Ted
at the bar.

83
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:42,549
It's 7:00 a.m.

84
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:46,553
Man, Ted really needs to work
on his boundaries.

85
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:48,672
Shh, guys, seriously.

86
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:51,942
Why are you in our bed?

87
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:55,195
I took the drunk train
and got stuck out here.

88
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:57,681
Oh, God, I am so hungover.

89
00:03:57,683 --> 00:04:00,484
Oh, God,
Lily's not wearing a bra!

90
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:01,902
Shh!

91
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:03,988
Bye, baby.

92
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,291
Do you think...?

93
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:09,043
Okay, I already know
I don't want to hear this.

94
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:10,878
Do you think
that if we did it...

95
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,696
Yeah, I was right.
I don't want to hear this.

96
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:14,715
...and I did
a really good job...

97
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:15,966
Please leave.

98
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:19,870
...that I could turn that
into my baby?

99
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:22,205
I think I'm gonna throw up.

100
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,925
Morning sickness?
No.

101
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:28,529
It's crazy, right?

102
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:29,680
Are you shocked?

103
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:31,932
No, I'm not shocked.
You're in love with Robin.

104
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:33,233
Do you remember back

105
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:35,385
at Christmas when she was upset,
you didn't even know why,

106
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,855
<i>and you spent eight hours
setting up Christmas lights</i>

107
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:39,723
<i>in the apartment
just to cheer her up.</i>

108
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:41,892
That was a platonic friend thing.
A platonic friend thing?

109
00:04:41,894 --> 00:04:44,611
Really? Ted,
let me ask you a question.

110
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,363
Would you have done that for me?

111
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:49,199
You probably would have.
You're such a good friend, Ted.

112
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,201
You, too, buddy.

113
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:52,419
I'm going into the city.

114
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:54,400
Just, while I'm gone,

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,648
don't go snooping around
in our stuff.

116
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:59,677
I know you think we have
a sex tape hidden somewhere,

117
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:03,147
so I'll save you the trouble.
We don't. Good-bye.

118
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:06,917
<i>Here's that moment
from Barney's perspective.</i>

119
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:11,021
We have a sex tape hidden
somewhere.

120
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:18,345
Challenge accepted.

121
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:20,564
Robin again?

122
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:22,866
Why does everyone
keep going after Robin?

123
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:25,402
How come no one
ever takes a run at me?

124
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:26,770
Barney hits on you every day.

125
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:28,706
Yeah, but he just wants
to bang me.

126
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,940
I want something real.

127
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,909
I know, babe.

128
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,877
Double A Cleaning.

129
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,945
Consuela, it's Barney.

130
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,280
I need you and the girls
for the afternoon.

131
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:38,882
Of course, right away,
Mr. Barney.

132
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:40,000
Are you at home now?

133
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:41,635
No, I'm at a house
on Long Island.

134
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:42,836
I'll text you the details.

135
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:45,389
It's a big job.
The place has been ransacked.

136
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,257
We'll get right on it.

137
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,759
Thanks, Consuela,
you're the best.

138
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:54,848
Ted, I know
you're ready to go

139
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,633
with this whole
you-and-Robin thing,

140
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:58,068
but is she ready
to go?

141
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,155
Is she ready to go? Um...

142
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:07,611
Mmm, we'll continue this...

143
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:09,663
when I get back.

144
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:14,084
So...

145
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:15,986
Are you sure
that it wasn't...?

146
00:06:19,323 --> 00:06:22,126
We'll continue this
when I get back.

147
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,761
Okay.

148
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,715
What?! No!

149
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:31,468
Damn it, Lily,
why are you rooting against me?

150
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,803
I'm not rooting
against you.

151
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:33,554
Yes, you are.

152
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:34,671
No, I'm not.

153
00:06:34,673 --> 00:06:35,956
<i>Yes, she was.</i>

154
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,008
You see, at that very moment...

155
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:46,066
"Long-term bets"?

156
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:56,910
Hmm.

157
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,262
My God! They're placing bets
on our lives.

158
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:18,482
And I'm sorry,
Ted cannot pull off bald.

159
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:20,267
You know Ted.
I'm right about this.

160
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:26,773
Ted, I'm your best friend.
Why would I root against you?

161
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:30,944
Lily bets Marshall that Ted
and Robin won't end up together.

162
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:33,063
<i>That's why.</i>

163
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,253
<i>So, Lily was betting against
me and Robin.</i>

164
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,546
<i>I just didn't know it.</i>

165
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:41,832
Okay, you want to make
it work with Robin?

166
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,967
You need to stay
on her radar.

167
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,919
Call her right now.

168
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:47,387
She's on the plane.
Her phone's off.

169
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,139
Oh, my God!

170
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:52,059
How adorable would it be
if when the plane lands,

171
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:53,176
she turns on her phone

172
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:56,096
and her mailbox is full
of messages from you?!

173
00:07:57,516 --> 00:08:00,160
Ted, don't leave
her any voice mails.

174
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:00,735
Why not?

175
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:03,219
Because...
Because you need to go to Russia.

176
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,604
With love!

177
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:05,856
Surprise her.

178
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:07,858
Make the--
in no way creepy--

179
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,729
grand romantic gesture
that we all know Robin loves.

180
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,698
Oh!

181
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,167
So I just walk up to her
in Red Square

182
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:18,402
with a dozen roses?

183
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:21,409
Or float down to her

184
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,111
in my hot air balloon

185
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:25,072
with ten dozen roses!

186
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:27,712
Yes, that's perfect!

187
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:29,330
Not like this, Lily.

188
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,020
Not like this.

189
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:34,417
If you'll excuse me,
I've got some sonnets to write.

190
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,920
Stay put, Ted.
You're gonna want to hear this.

191
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,450
Guys, what's this?

192
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:43,174
<i>And Marshall and Lily
explained.</i>

193
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,257
<i>It all started ten years
earlier.</i>

194
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,025
<i>They had been looking
for a new hobby</i>

195
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:48,758
<i>they could do as a couple.</i>

196
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,391
I already missed
the beginner's lesson.

197
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:52,991
Maybe I shouldn't even go.

198
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:54,700
Ah, screw it.

199
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:57,161
I've seen the Olympics.
I know what I'm doing.

200
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,847
I'm going skiing, bitches!

201
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,239
He's gonna break
his leg.

202
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,372
He's not gonna
break his leg.

203
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:16,955
20 bucks says he does.

204
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,578
"Lily bets Marshall

205
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,482
that Ted
will break his leg skiing."

206
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,925
You would be amazed.

207
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:36,058
People fall off ski lifts
all the time.

208
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,777
Well, I gotta hit the head.

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,053
Well, he didn't
break his leg.

210
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,289
Yeah, I gotta say that, um,

211
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,676
making money off this bet
just makes me feel...

212
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:55,277
More alive than
you've felt in years?

213
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,296
Yes!
New hobby!

214
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,817
We need a cash box,
some glitter and some glue!

215
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:04,353
You've been
betting on us?

216
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,272
Like we're a
couple of hobos

217
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:07,823
fighting over
a sandwich

218
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,309
in some psycho preppy
kid's backyard?

219
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:12,695
No, this is just
what happens in marriage.

220
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:13,662
You get bored.

221
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:15,364
You run out
of things to do.

222
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,815
We were making models.

223
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,534
You single people
are out there

224
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,953
with the drinking
and the sleeping around...

225
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,288
Model airplanes.

226
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,489
The grinding
and the bumping

227
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,325
and the hot sweaty bodies.

228
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:28,660
...with little propellers
that spin.

229
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,596
Oh, this one looks
interesting.

230
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:32,664
Lily, I thought you said
you wanted to.

231
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,883
It was your idea.

232
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:37,269
I starved myself for a week
to get camera-ready.

233
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,071
You had a bear claw
for breakfast.

234
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:41,273
<i>Yeah, a bear claw.</i>

235
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,508
I-I changed my mind.

236
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,512
I-I just don't want Barney
to see us doing it.

237
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,315
Barney is never gonna see this.

238
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:51,516
Oh, come on. It's Barney.

239
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,370
Eventually,
somehow he's gonna see it.

240
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:55,554
Want to bet?

241
00:10:55,556 --> 00:11:00,409
So there really is a sex tape.

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,469
Anyhoozles,
just... long-term bets,

243
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,304
just a silly thing we do.

244
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:13,538
What about you, Ted?

245
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,707
Your hair's looking good.

246
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,260
"Lily bets Marshall
that Ted and Robin

247
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,812
won't end up together."

248
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,982
Wow.

249
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:25,601
So now it's
becoming clear why...

250
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,153
you've been trying to sabotage
my future happiness.

251
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,572
To win a bet.

252
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:30,739
Come on, Ted.

253
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,858
We made that bet
so long ago.

254
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,779
And boy, it's been
a real nail-biter.

255
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:39,248
Ted and Stella
got engaged.

256
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,416
Pay up.

257
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:41,901
Not yet.

258
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:43,902
We are driving
to the wedding.

259
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,237
Pay up.

260
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,239
Not yet.

261
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,043
We are at the wedding.

262
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,077
Pay up.

263
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,745
Not yet.

264
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,867
Damn it.

265
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:00,719
I can't believe you guys!

266
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:01,971
I got left at the altar,

267
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,806
and all you cared about
was some stupid bet?

268
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:06,113
I never stopped rooting
for you, but I...

269
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:08,175
Ted, I'm not rooting
against you.

270
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,511
I just don't think Robin's
the girl you marry.

271
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:13,180
That's why I made
the stupid bet to begin with.

272
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:15,316
I mean, yes,
it's five years later,

273
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,184
and you haven't settled down
with anyone else,

274
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:20,171
but you haven't settled down
with Robin, either.

275
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,390
There must be
a reason for that.

276
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:24,681
What's standing
in the way?

277
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,084
God...

278
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,047
if you help me find
this sex tape,

279
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,506
I am going to make
some changes in my life.

280
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,008
I am going to stop
sleeping around,

281
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,794
quit drinking so much,
no more shenanigans.

282
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,464
I am going to devote
my entire life

283
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:50,184
to doing good deeds,
and praising your name.

284
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,419
Is this what you're
looking for, Mr. Barney?

285
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:55,773
Never mind, bro. Found it.

286
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,527
I found it!

287
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,730
Sweet glory hallelujah,
I found it, Ted.

288
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,099
You're the only idiot I know
who still owns a VCR,

289
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:06,767
so you are
the lucky winner of the

290
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,269
"Who gets to sit next to me
and watch our best friends

291
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:11,372
go bananas all over each other""
sweepstakes.

292
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,458
To the outdated
viewing device!

293
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,410
<i>And then I realized
why Robin and I</i>

294
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:18,879
<i>hadn't gotten back together
in the last five years.</i>

295
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,132
Oh, my God.

296
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,984
Robin's in love with you.

297
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:31,717
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

298
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:33,356
Robin is in love with you.

299
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:35,835
No, she's not.
Trust me.

300
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:37,301
Yes, she is.

301
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:39,486
Something happened
between you guys.

302
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:41,138
That's why
you broke up with Nora.

303
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,991
That night,
I saw you in her room,

304
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:46,610
there were rose petals,
candles...

305
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:48,412
You saw that?

306
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:50,531
Well, then, maybe you also saw

307
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:53,534
those rose petals and candles
going into a garbage bag.

308
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,753
<i>And then Barney
told me everything.</i>

309
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:58,372
<i>How he and Robin hooked up.</i>

310
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:01,458
<i>How he broke up with Nora
to be with her.</i>

311
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,545
<i>How he thought she would do
the same for him.</i>

312
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:07,298
<i>How she broke his heart.</i>

313
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:12,853
She chose Kevin.

314
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,356
It hurt, but...

315
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,974
I guess they're in love.

316
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:18,409
They broke up last night.

317
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:20,561
Bummer.

318
00:14:20,563 --> 00:14:23,864
Anyway, let's make our own bets
about this sex tape.

319
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:26,317
I've got Marshall
with a surprise piercing

320
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:27,785
at five-to-one odds,

321
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:30,454
Lily with a landing strip,
ten-to-one,

322
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:32,323
Marshall with a landing strip,
even money.

323
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:34,825
I don't believe this.

324
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:36,327
You were in love with Robin,

325
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:38,545
you find out she's single,
and your reaction is "Bummer"?

326
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:39,663
What do you want me to say, Ted?

327
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:42,333
Whatever I
thought was there,

328
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:45,119
she thought differently.

329
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:48,005
So... no, I don't care
that Robin is single again.

330
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:51,892
So if Robin started dating
someone else, you wouldn't mind?

331
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:52,977
Nope.

332
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:55,646
Even if that somebody else
was me?

333
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:59,733
Even if that somebody else
was you.

334
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,585
Really?
Really.

335
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,754
Hey, bros before hos, right?

336
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:06,390
No matter how mad she made me,

337
00:15:06,392 --> 00:15:09,009
Robin's still my bro.

338
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:10,928
And if, uh, you make her happy,

339
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,563
then that makes me happy.

340
00:15:13,565 --> 00:15:17,117
Barney, you've really grown up,
you know that?

341
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,585
Thanks.

342
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:21,171
Now let's watch our two best
friends have sex on tape.

343
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:22,756
I'll make the popcorn.

344
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,092
Don't watch that tape!

345
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:27,011
Watch that tape!

346
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,578
Well, sorry, I just really
want to win the bet.

347
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,247
And here we go.

348
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:32,683
O-okay. Okay, fine, Barney.

349
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:34,852
Watch our dirty little home
movie, but be forewarned,

350
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:37,187
at about the one minute mark,

351
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:39,056
you're going to see me
make this face.

352
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:43,027
Oh, God,
that's the face you made

353
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,361
the day we rode motorcycles.
Yeah.

354
00:15:44,363 --> 00:15:45,813
Yeah. You really
want to see that?

355
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:48,532
A-and do you want
to hear me go, uh...

356
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:55,105
It can't sound like that.
It can't.

357
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:56,874
I know that noise, I've heard it
through the walls.

358
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:58,459
I thought the neighbors
had a sick cat.

359
00:15:58,461 --> 00:15:59,626
Okay, but, Barney,
just remember,

360
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:01,578
you'll also be seeing
a lot of this:

361
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,914
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

362
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,632
It's this, but
I'm not pregnant.

363
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:08,969
My skin is loose,
like an elephant.

364
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:11,255
My boobs are
perky and plump.

365
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:13,340
I slobber
like a confused old dog.

366
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:15,676
I slap my own ass.
I slap my own ass!

367
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:22,632
Barney...

368
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:23,901
<i>that was my VCR.</i>

369
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:26,019
Ted...

370
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:28,238
it was a VCR.

371
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:33,254
A week later, Robin's plane landed...

372
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,276
<i>and I was there to meet
her at the airport.</i>

373
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,616
♪

374
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,262
She told me all about her trip.

375
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:46,773
<i>And then we got dinner at the restaurant
 we hadn't been to in a long time.</i>

376
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:51,100
<i>And by the end of the night,
one thing had become clear:</i>

377
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:54,302
It's not going to happen, is it?

378
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:56,554
I'm sorry.

379
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,604
It's because of Barney.

380
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:02,072
What?

381
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:03,607
No.

382
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:05,058
Barney and I... we...

383
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,195
No. No. It's just...

384
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:11,548
You know, things have
just been so crazy lately.

385
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:16,103
Everything in my life
is... unstable.

386
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:19,289
I mean, you're one of the few
things that I can count on.

387
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,943
And... I really don't
want to mess that up.

388
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:28,165
We-we... we still have our deal,
right?

389
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:31,785
If we're both still...
single when we're 40?

390
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:33,953
Yeah. Yeah.

391
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:38,759
No. Look... I'm sorry.

392
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:40,761
I-I can't do that anymore.

393
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:43,480
As long as the door
is even a little bit open,

394
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:45,766
I have this feeling
that I'll just be...

395
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:49,403
waiting around to see if I win
the lottery when you turn 40.

396
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,190
I think you know
how you feel about me now,

397
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:57,094
and... I don't think time's
going to change that.

398
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:00,792
Just tell me.

399
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:02,749
Do you love me?

400
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,774
No.

401
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,748
I'm sorry.

402
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:21,688
We're great as friends.

403
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,875
Let's just...

404
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,575
Let's just forget
I ever said anything.

405
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:33,450
Bar. Alone. Now.

406
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,068
It's just a bump
in the road.

407
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:36,742
You guys are meant
to be together.

408
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,235
You can't give up.

409
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:39,347
You... i-it can still happen.

410
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:40,503
No. Marshall...

411
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,168
What about
the hot air balloon thing,

412
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,599
with the ten dozen roses?

413
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,455
And how's the sonnet coming, buddy?
Dude.

414
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:48,062
You bet on the wrong horse.
Let it go.

415
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:50,338
Believe it or not,

416
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,056
I'm happy about this. I'm...

417
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:54,507
I can finally move on.

418
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:56,423
This is a good thing.

419
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:58,150
Really.

420
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:05,741
Hey, Robin.

421
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,209
Oh, hey.
Hey.

422
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:09,411
Hey. Uh, look, before I forget,
here's Lily's hairdryer.

423
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:11,931
I borrowed it, like,
a million years ago.

424
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,432
Yeah, you can keep that.

425
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:14,767
Um... Hey, listen,

426
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:16,418
Ted told me what happened
with you guys,

427
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,187
and he says that
he's at peace with it.

428
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:19,922
Oh, really?

429
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:21,474
That's good.

430
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:24,259
He's lying, Robin.

431
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:27,646
He's trying to be strong,
but it's killing him,

432
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:30,566
and so, as his best friend,

433
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,535
I have to say something that...

434
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:34,870
he loves you
just way too much to say.

435
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,557
You gotta move out.

436
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:42,712
