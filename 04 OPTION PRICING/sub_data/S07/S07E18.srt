<i>NARRATOR: Kids, 2012 started out
kind of crazy.</i>

2
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:07,157
Barney met a girl named Quinn,

3
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:09,155
<i>Kevin unproposed to Robin,</i>

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,436
<i>I told Robin...</i>

5
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:11,813
I love you, Robin.

6
00:00:11,824 --> 00:00:12,656
<i>When I asked if she</i>

7
00:00:12,663 --> 00:00:14,580
<i>loved me back, she said...</i>

8
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,311
No.

9
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:17,473
<i>Marshall told Robin...</i>

10
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,450
You got to move out.

11
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:22,583
<i>And Robin did.</i>

12
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,644
I can't even open
her bedroom door anymore.

13
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:35,371
Why do I have
to be so sensitive?

14
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:37,669
I don't know, bro.

15
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:38,902
Look at me and that Quinn chick.

16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,195
You don't hear me
prattling on

17
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:42,422
about how beautiful
her smile is,

18
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:46,474
how her hair is like a waterfall
of honey-colored silk,

19
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:49,921
how her eyes are like
a warm South Sea

20
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:53,229
kissed by the fire
and gold of sunrise.

21
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,253
I don't even remember
what she looks like.

22
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:57,268
Dude, you obviously like her.
Can't you read

23
00:00:57,284 --> 00:00:58,467
between the lines, Ted?

24
00:00:58,477 --> 00:00:59,810
I obviously like her.

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,403
How did this happen to me?

26
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,650
When did I become such
a gooey romantic?

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,568
Look, I think it's healthy

28
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:10,329
that you have real feelings
for a woman

29
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,350
instead of just seeing her
as an object.

30
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:13,698
Switch?

31
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,424
Sure.

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,846
(snaps fingers)

33
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:16,891
But why Quinn?

34
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,432
I mean, you spent
one night with her,

35
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:19,610
and she was kind of mean.

36
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,003
We just connected.

37
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,965
Emotionally, intellectually,
spiritually.

38
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:24,952
So, mind-blowing sex?

39
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,762
Mind-blowing sex!

40
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:31,450
For an hour afterwards,
I couldn't uncross my eyes.

41
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:34,228
Which was awesome, because
when I went back for seconds,

42
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:36,581
it was like having
a three-way with twins.

43
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,682
So... call her.

44
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,931
I would if I knew how
to get in touch with her,

45
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:42,882
but I can't,
and it's driving me crazy.

46
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:44,096
Everywhere I look,
I see her.

47
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:45,522
I see her walking on the street;

48
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:48,150
I see her shopping in the store;

49
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,186
I see her dancing on that pole.

50
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:52,285
I see her dancing
on that pole, too.

51
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:54,635
Oh, my God, that's Quinn.

52
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:57,836
EMCEE: Gentlemen,
give it up for Karma.

53
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:12,366
I really appreciate
you guys taking me in.

54
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:13,427
I mean,

55
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:14,936
I'm homeless,

56
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:17,198
things between me and Ted
are still kind of weird.

57
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:19,498
So, it's nice
to be around friends.

58
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,349
Well, stay as long
as you want, sweetie.

59
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:22,562
Oh, thank you.

60
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:23,921
Mm.

61
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:26,099
Now, I got you a journal.

62
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,365
I know this sounds lame,

63
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,043
but it really helps work
through stuff to write about it.

64
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:31,395
Oh.

You are going to have
so much fun here.

70
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:44,988
Oh, guys, please, do not feel like you
have to keep me entertained.

71
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,244
Well, you shouldn't have come
to East Meadow, Long Island,

72
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,059
Robin, if you didn't want
to be entertained.

73
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:51,373
Really? I didn't think
there was a ton to do here.

74
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,724
Oh, apparently, someone
hasn't heard

75
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,858
of the Uniondale
Miniatures Museum.

76
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:58,091
You'll come for
the 19th century thimble art,

77
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:01,693
but you'll stay for the
Dutch masters on bottle caps.

78
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,584
Plus,

79
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:03,758
you'll be bowling
with two

80
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,102
charter members of the
East Meadow Alley Cats.

81
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:08,847
"We're a hot dog eating team

82
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,556
with a bowling problem."

83
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:11,568
Shirley

84
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:13,109
came up with that one.

85
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,171
Great bowler, Shirley.

86
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
She hit 280 the other day.

87
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,796
Unfortunately,
that was on her bathroom scale.

88
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,894
<i>NARRATOR: When Robin moved out,</i>

89
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:23,688
<i>there was a hole in my life</i>

90
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,584
<i>in the shape
of an empty bedroom.</i>

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,216
<i>I filled it with a new hobby.</i>

92
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:30,035
(sizzling)

93
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,415
(coughing)

94
00:03:31,426 --> 00:03:33,143
What are you doing
in my old room?

95
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:34,990
This room being empty
was bumming me out,

96
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,720
so I decided
to do something healthy

97
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,183
that would take my mind off you.

98
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,644
Well, nothing says healthy

99
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:41,789
like smoking 40 pounds
of pork loin

100
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,137
in an unventilated room

101
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:45,649
while having an imaginary
conversation with your ex.

102
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:47,968
Just for that,
you're not getting any.

103
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:49,184
I'm not getting any?

104
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,061
You're the one smoking
your own meat.

105
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,124
Oh!

106
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:53,966
(knocking)

107
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,699
What am I gonna do
about this Quinn thing?

108
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,118
I want to ask her out again,

109
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,229
but I don't know how I feel
about her being a stripper.

110
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:02,862
Why would you have
an issue with that?

111
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:05,515
I mean, you've dated convicted
felons, arms dealers...

112
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:07,118
pageant moms.

113
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,082
Hey, Quinn is someone I might
want to get serious with,

114
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,579
not just pretend to be a judge

115
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:18,863
<i>(chuckles) Tiffany's mom really
wanted that tiara.</i>

116
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:21,953
In a city of eight
million people,

117
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:25,077
you happened to walk into
the club where she works?

118
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,132
Maybe it's destiny.

119
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,525
No, Destiny strips
at The Melon Patch.

120
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,143
They're people, Ted;
try to keep them straight.

121
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,834
Wait a minute.

122
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:37,034
What if this is destiny?

123
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:37,939
I just said...

124
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,563
What if the universe

125
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:42,627
is throwing us in each other's
path for some reason?

126
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,849
More or less exactly what I...

127
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:46,642
I don't care what you say,
this is destiny!

128
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,712
Damn it, Ted!

129
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,971
Why can't you ever root
for love?

130
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:56,298
Hey.

131
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:57,940
Hey.

132
00:04:57,953 --> 00:04:59,085
Quinn...

133
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:00,261
No, listen,

134
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,237
in here I'm Karma, okay?

135
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:03,350
Got it.

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,660
Uh, look, Karma,

137
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,669
I swear

138
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,861
I never say crap
like this, but...

139
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:09,077
I think maybe
the universe

140
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,470
is telling us something.

141
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:13,088
You want to go out again?

142
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:15,485
I'm sorry,
I don't date customers.

143
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:16,802
What about destiny?

144
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,729
I heard she's
over at The Melon Patch now.

145
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:22,445
No, I mean like fate telling us
that we're supposed to be...

146
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:23,637
Oh, listen, Barney,

147
00:05:23,647 --> 00:05:25,897
my manager is really
giving me the stink eye.

148
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:27,798
I have to get back to work.

149
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:28,845
Okay, wait, wait.

150
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:30,569
What if I pay for a dance?

151
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,532
That way,

152
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,623
your manager's happy,

153
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,964
and then I can to tell you

154
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,758
why you should go on
another date with me.

155
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:38,540
I guess there's
no reason why not.

156
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,294
Okay, first off,
we have a lot in common.

157
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:42,697
For example,

158
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,824
both of our jobs
are largely financed

159
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,025
by drunk Asian businessmen.

00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:44,916
<i>the night.</i>

181
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,054
<i>Also Diary, I think writing
in you is stupid,</i>

182
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:48,335
but you were a gift from Lily,

183
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:49,879
<i>and she's watching
me right now.</i>

184
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:53,443
Guys, um, I don't want
to overstay my welcome,

185
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,201
and Patrice said that she would
take me off your hands.

186
00:06:56,221 --> 00:06:59,239
So, do you have
a train schedule or...

187
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:00,511
Oh, yeah,

188
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:01,521
um, but-but

189
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:04,363
there's a-a problem
with the train.

190
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:06,083
Big, big problem.

191
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:06,995
There was a...

192
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:09,270
Strike.
A lightning strike.

193
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:12,488
That hit one of the picketers
who was on strike.

194
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,646
During a thunderstorm.

195
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:18,664
Plus,

196
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:21,826
Yeah, she probably doesn't
even want you there.

197
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,296
You guys are being weird.

198
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:30,478
Oh!
Oh!

199
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:33,149
Oh, my God, Robin,
I am so sorry.

200
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,768
I'll throw these in the wash.

201
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:37,698
They'll be dry
and folded in the morning.

202
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,202
Or the weekend.

203
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:40,880
And we can talk
about you leaving then.

204
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,243
(quietly):
Or never.

205
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,754
Wait, Lily, why don't...
(yawns loudly)

206
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,773
It's 8:45,
time to hit the hay.

207
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:48,872
LILY:
Good night!

208
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:50,453
(lock clicks)

209
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:56,632
So Ted, what healthy,

210
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:59,180
not-at-all-crazy activity
are you up to now?

211
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,867
I liked smoking meat,
but now I've got a new passion:

212
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,493
wood.

213
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:07,539
You hear these things that come
out of your mouth, right?

214
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:09,095
(knocking)

215
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:15,305
So I went back to
the Lusty Leopard.

216
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,837
You know what, Barney?

217
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,884
I know I said I have a rule
about not dating customers,

218
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:23,808
but you may have
convinced me to...

219
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,385
(music stops)
Oh.

220
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:26,830
Song's over, I got to go.

221
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,074
Wait, no, what?
Convinced you to what?

222
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,059
I'm sorry, but manager's
giving me the stink eye.

223
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:34,381
Ugh, get a life, Manager.

224
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:36,972
What were you saying?

225
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,402
Well, I was going to say

226
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,105
that I do find you
very... charming.

227
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,862
(chuckles)

228
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:45,670
And funny...

229
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:47,133
and sexy.

230
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:49,996
And exciting and smart.

231
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:52,351
You so get me.

232
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:54,067
You know what, Barney?

233
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,581
I have never done
this before,

234
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,301
but there's just
something about you.

235
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,012
So I guess my answer is...

236
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,557
(music stops)
(gasps) Oh.

237
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:04,568
The song's over.

238
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,293
Well, just finish the thought!

239
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,840
But the manager.
God,

240
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:08,851
I hate manager.

241
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,793
(snoring)

242
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,174
There. Your answer is...

243
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:15,609
Maybe if we knew each other
a little better.

244
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:16,609
(sighs)

245
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:17,634
Tell me about yourself.

246
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,642
Well, um, what can I tell you?

247
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:20,657
I'm, um...

248
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:22,832
charming and funny

249
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:25,466
and sexy and...

250
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:29,037
exciting and smart.

251
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:31,063
Well, how can a girl
say no to that?

252
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:33,445
How about we...

253
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:35,428
go out on...

254
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:39,228
aaaaaaaaa...

255
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:41,090
aaaaaa...

256
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,820
Ugh, these songs are so short.

257
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,866
(groans)

258
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:49,306
Uh, how much exactly
did you give Quinn?

259
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:50,199
Eight, nine hundred bucks,

260
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:53,045
plus whatever
my Rolex is worth.

261
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:54,231
Whoa.

262
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,273
I know.

263
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:58,316
Ted, I think I'm in love.

264
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,657
Quinn is totally playing you.

265
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:08,634
What?

266
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:10,126
That's ridiculous.

267
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:11,371
If she were playing me,

268
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:13,364
why would she agree
to go on a date with me?

269
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,796
You're different than
the rest of these schlubs.

270
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:19,315
This one time only,
I'm going to break my rule.

271
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,204
Let's go out tomorrow night.

272
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,442
Sweet!

273
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:25,870
Oh, shoot!
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

274
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:28,413
Hey! Brainstorm!

275
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:30,197
What if we just have
our date here,

276
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,277
It's a date.

277
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,591
It's not a date, if you go into a
strip club and paying for lap dances.

278
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:39,526
If it's not a date, why'd she
say, every fifth day was free?

279
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:41,360
Because that's
the Lusty Leopard's policy

280
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,041
on Friday nights, and I'm so mad
at you that I know that!

281
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:47,746
<i>ROBIN: Dear Diary.</i>

282
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,689
<i>It is day six on this island,</i>

283
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:53,422
<i>and I begin to fear I am
more captive than guest...</i>

284
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,353
(screams)

285
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,746
Morning, sweetie.

286
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,757
Up for croquet?

287
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:02,180
Hey, uh, Lil, are you done

288
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:04,332
washing my clothes yet?
Because I...

289
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:05,564
Oh, I am so sorry.

290
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:07,657
Your clothes accidentally
wound up in the bag

291
00:11:07,673 --> 00:11:09,723
I donated to Goodwill.

292
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:11,926
You gave away my clothes?

293
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,906
They were a bit fancy
for East Meadow.

294
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:17,095
(whispers):
People were staring.

295
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:20,696
Besides, we have
an extra Snugget.

296
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:23,396
Try it.

297
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:26,585
Try it, Robin.

298
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,531
<i>ROBIN: They're trying to make me
one of them, Diary.</i>

299
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:33,463
<i>And I begin to fear...</i>

300
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,869
<i>I may like it!</i>

301
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,490
I can't believe we're
at a strip club,

302
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:42,805
and the biggest boob
in here is you.

303
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:45,189
It's a real date, Ted.

304
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:48,208
And clearly you haven't
seen the DeSalvo twins.

305
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,480
She's right over there.

306
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,573
Barney...
Yowza!

307
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:54,239
You are not on a date.

308
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,575
Okay, look, prove it.

309
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:58,153
Prove that she's not just
taking advantage of you.

310
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:00,589
Get her to go out with
you anywhere but here.

311
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:01,856
Fine!

312
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,333
Hey, sexy! You want a dance?

313
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:05,685
Yeah!

314
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,195
Uh, one thing, though.

315
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,540
Um, you'd be okay
with us having a date

316
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:11,374
somewhere besides here,
wouldn't you?

317
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:13,939
I was hoping you would ask that.

318
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,676
I'm sorry it's
so expensive in here,

319
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:18,812
but it's nice and private, huh?

320
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:20,295
Absolutely. And romantic!

321
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,423
It's our first getaway
as a couple!

322
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:25,149
It's become clear to me, Diary,

323
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,042
<i>that I must attempt
a dramatic escape.</i>

324
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:30,275
<i>I will fake a stomach ache
during dinner.</i>

325
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,498
<i>Then, after Marshall and Lily
leave for bingo night,</i>

326
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:34,649
<i>I will sneak out the back.</i>

327
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:37,532
<i>I'll swipe Shirley's Rascal
and drive to the train station.</i>

328
00:12:37,553 --> 00:12:39,586
<i>Shirley's 42, by the way,
and rides a Rascal.</i>

329
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:43,454
<i>I swear, it's the second half
of Wall-E out here.</i>

330
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,631
(two handclaps)

331
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,331
Bingo...

332
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,186
was canceled.

333
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:57,869
Hey, sexy, you want a dance?

334
00:12:57,891 --> 00:13:00,258
(chuckles) No,
I'm not a customer.

335
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:01,757
My girlfriend works here.

336
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:04,570
She's right over...

337
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:06,659
This one time only,
I'm gonna break my rule.

338
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:08,126
Let's go out tomorrow night!

339
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,087
Sweet!

340
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:10,378
Oh, shoot!

341
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:13,505
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

342
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:14,761
Hey! Brainstorm!

343
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:16,688
What if we just have
our date here,

344
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:20,154
maybe in
the Champagne Room?

345
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,896
That was our spot.

346
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,623
Hey, gorgeous,
You want a dance?

347
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,077
Is it a jig?

348
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:34,188
'Cause if so, it's up.

349
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,442
Sorry, I only had the last verse

350
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:38,955
of "Hot For Teacher" to work
on that. What was that?

351
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:42,875
You laid exactly the same line
on that guy that you did on me!

352
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:43,918
Sweetie, that is just something

353
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,595
I say to these
gullible losers here.

354
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,231
They fall for it every time.

355
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,046
(chuckling): Bunch of losers!

356
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:54,073
Oh, gosh, manager again.

357
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,287
He's looking at me like,

358
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,047
"Karma, why aren't you booking
more time

359
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,226
in the Champagne Room?"

360
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:00,569
Well, we'll show him.

361
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,204
No! You're playing me again!

362
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:05,774
And you're not even trying hard!

363
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:07,593
There's no manager there;
You're pointing at a fern!

364
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:11,070
Ted was right.

365
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,934
I bet he's home right now,
laughing at how dumb I am.

366
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:22,147
Did I deserve this?
Absolutely.

367
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:25,168
I have told
some outrageous lies.

368
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,541
I have told women I was famous,

369
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:28,924
a war hero,

370
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,418
that sex with me would cure
their nearsightedness.

371
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,070
Barney?!

372
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,399
I probably deserved everything
you did to me and more.

373
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:40,090
But I have been trying,

374
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:43,087
and trying hard
to be a better person.

375
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,880
Thanks for showing me

376
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,438
I had it right before.

377
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,826
Look, I'm sorry we made you feel
a little suffocated,

378
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:01,238
but were you really
just gonna sneak away?

379
00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:04,181
Well, it's just...
I really miss the city.

380
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:06,535
I know you guys love it here,
and that's fine,

381
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:07,869
We don't love it here!

382
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,544
What?

383
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:09,717
Come on, Robin,

384
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,743
what kind
of life is this?

385
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,342
Going to canasta tournaments

386
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,054
and high school
field hockey playoffs?

387
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:17,652
Oh, I think North Bellmore
can take state.

388
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,671
With Sophie's ankle?
Doubtful.

389
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,819
Okay, but if you two
are so unhappy,

390
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:23,835
why don't you just move
back to Manhattan?

391
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,551
Because the suburbs are
better for the baby.

392
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:29,705
Who says? Who says any place
is better for the baby

393
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,928
if you two are unhappy in it?

394
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:36,410
No, no,
we live here now.

395
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,817
And, you know,
this place

396
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:40,297
wouldn't seem
so bad if...

397
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:43,192
we got one of our friends
to move out here.

398
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:45,651
Oh, guys...

399
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:48,633
Oh...

400
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:51,388
I would rather set myself
on fire.

401
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:54,919
<i>NARRATOR: The next morning,
Barney learned that even in</i>

402
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:58,243
<i>a city of eight million people,
there's no escaping Karma.</i>

403
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,818
(light music playing)

404
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,512
(sighs)

405
00:16:05,522 --> 00:16:06,538
Oh.

406
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:08,212
Oh, hey.

407
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:11,009
Sorry, can't talk;
manager's watching.

408
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,010
Look, I am sorry

409
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,936
if I hurt your feelings;
it's a job.

410
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,317
Yeah, well, at my job,

411
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:19,244
we don't rip out
people's hearts for money.

412
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,845
My company briefly backed
a lab in North Korea

413
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:25,961
which did, but we sold it!

414
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:27,893
You know, I've worked
at that club for a year.

415
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:29,291
You practically live there,

416
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,252
and you didn't even recognize me
the night we went out.

417
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:34,384
You can't pretend to be some
hurt little victim with me.

418
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:35,456
I know you.

419
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:36,681
Well, of course you do.

420
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:38,257
I told you things
I don't tell anybody.

421
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:39,452
I was honest with you.

422
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:41,579
Yeah, because I believe you have
a gay black brother,

423
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,311
a friend lonely enough
to smoke his own meat

424
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:45,158
and that your mom was a groupie
for Supertramp.

425
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,206
They named
their band for her!

426
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,362
You remembered all that?

427
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:54,760
Well, yeah.
I mean,

428
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:56,060
you're more interesting
than the lyrics

429
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:58,705
to "Pour Some Sugar On Me"
for the 8,000th time.

430
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:02,323
You know, it's funny.

431
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:05,503
Almost every woman
I've ever met was wrong

432
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,142
to give me a chance.

433
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:10,306
You're the first woman
who's wrong not to.

434
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:15,004
Large black coffee...

435
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:18,049
and whatever he's having.

436
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,671
It's on me.

437
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:22,940
The same.

438
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,374
Thank you.

439
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:26,802
You're welcome.

440
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,821
1,700 more of these
and we're even.

441
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:31,826
Uh, the song just ended.

442
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,674
That mean you got
to get going?

443
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:35,989
No.

444
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,057
Do you have time
to sit with me?

445
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:40,840
I don't know.
You're wearing my watch.

446
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:46,819
Pottery.
Now you're making pottery.

447
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,722
I needed a new vase...

448
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:50,636
and some plates.

449
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:51,917
And bowls.

450
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:54,344
The china cabinet I built had
some design flaws.

451
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:57,113
Why don't you just turn
this into a guest room?

452
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,499
A guest room?

453
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,544
(chuckles) You mean
a room ready and waiting

454
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,891
for someone who isn't there?

455
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:05,121
A room devoted to reminding me
that I'm still alone?

456
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:08,562
Yeah, I don't need that.

457
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:13,423
Ted, no matter how many things
you put in this room...

458
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:15,724
I'll still be here.

459
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,001
(knocking)

460
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:28,094
Hey.

461
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,284
Hey!

462
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:32,171
Come on in.

463
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:34,148
Thanks.

464
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,705
Oh, um, thanks for packing up
the rest of my stuff.

465
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:40,057
No problem. Uh, you
want some coffee?

466
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,409
Uh, sure. Yeah?
Yeah.

467
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:44,885
So, how are things?

468
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:46,862
Good! You?
Great!

469
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,860
You know, I actually
made this mug.

470
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,441
Oh, yeah? Oh!
Yeah. Oh!

471
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:53,121
Yeah, sorry, coffee's
a little strong.

472
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:56,816
How was your stay
with Marshall and Lily?

473
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,868
Uh... a little weird.

474
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,018
They're not loving Long Island.

475
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:02,200
Oh.

476
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,741
I think deep down, they realize

477
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:05,721
it just... isn't a good fit.

478
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:09,321
It's hard to admit that
sometimes.

479
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:11,213
Sure is.

480
00:19:11,228 --> 00:19:14,529
But I guess it's better
to face it and move on

481
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:19,256
than try to force something that
just isn't meant to be, right?

482
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,005
I think so.

483
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:22,367
Yeah.

484
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:22,683
So, what do you think

485
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,243
you're gonna do
with my old room?

486
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:25,771
Haven't really thought about it.

487
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:27,449
Oh!

488
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:35,725
Who needs Manhattan?

489
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,074
Yeah.

490
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:39,201
(phone buzzes)

491
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:41,217
Hmm, it's Ted.
He wants to know

492
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,250
if we want to hang
out in the city.

493
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,132
The next train leaves
in nine minutes.

494
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:01,371
(door closes)

495
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,363
<i>TED: Dear Lily and Marshall,
I don't know if you know this,</i>

496
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,391
<i>but I never took
your names off the lease.</i>

497
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:13,115
<i>Well, today
I took my name off it.</i>

498
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:16,142
<i>The apartment is now yours.</i>

499
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:18,998
<i>And I think I finally figured
out the best thing</i>

500
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,986
<i>to do with Robin's old room.</i>

501
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:23,134
(soft gasp)

502
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:33,570
<i>See, for me, this place has
begun to feel a little haunted.</i>

503
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:36,180
<i>At first, I thought
it was haunted by Robin,</i>

504
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:39,067
<i>but now I think
it was haunted by me.</i>

505
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:44,141
<i>Well, no ghost is at peace
until it finally moves on.</i>

506
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:47,403
<i>I need a change.</i>

507
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:49,451
<i>And I think you do, too.</i>

508
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:52,133
<i>This apartment needs
some new life.</i>

509
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:56,489
<i>So, please, make our old home
your new home.</i>

510
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,037
<i>It is now ghost-free.</i>

511
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:00,671
<i>Love, Ted.</i>
