1
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:04,400
<i>By the fall of 2011,
technology had taken</i>

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:07,569
<i>a lot of the intrigue
out of life.</i>

3
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:11,953
<i>The Internet had everyone's
wall of information.</i>

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,540
<i>Nothing was a mystery anymore.</i>

5
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:20,937
<i>But, kids, there was
a time before that,</i>

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,405
<i>way back in the dark ages.</i>

7
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:24,806
Are you people insane?!

8
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:27,293
The most popular food in America
is the cheeseburger!

9
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:28,777
No way! It's pizza!

10
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,997
Are we forgetting about
a certain Mr. Furter,

11
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:33,582
first name Frank?

12
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:35,984
Um, what did every kid
bring in their lunchbox

13
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,153
every day till
grade eight?

14
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:39,821
Pancakes with
maple syrup.

15
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,091
Thanks, Canada.

16
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:44,843
<i>We're looking for a food
the average American eats.</i>

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,328
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh!

18
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,630
Chinese food.

19
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:50,099
<i>And then came the smartphone.</i>

20
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,269
Hey, remember

21
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:56,689
when we were arguing about
the most popular food?

22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,974
It's bread.

23
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,726
Hm.

24
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,112
<i>And the barroom debate
was dead.</i>

25
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:05,180
<i>You guys are idiots!</i>

26
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:07,983
<i>Okay, not completely dead.
You are seriously telling me</i>

27
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,485
you don't want
to open that envelope

28
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,687
and find out if you're
having a boy or a girl?

29
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:15,374
Nope. Dr. Sonya only gave us
this in case we wanted to know.

30
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,076
But we don't.

31
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,745
Lilypad and I are just gonna
wait till that baby pops out

32
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,130
and enjoy the big surprise.

33
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,832
Look, I have pretended
to be a licensed therapist

34
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,001
enough times to know
there is something unhealthy

35
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,836
about your not wanting
to find out.

36
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,089
- Back me up here, Kev.
- No, no, no, no, no.

37
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,425
This real therapist
won't risk upsetting

38
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,146
his wonderful new girlfriend by
analyzing her wonderful friends.

39
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:40,983
No matter how mentally
unbalanced they may be.

40
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:42,101
I hear you.

41
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,719
I don't think you do.

42
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,655
We just don't want to
burden our little angel

43
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:49,992
with all kinds of
gender-specific expectations.

44
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:52,695
Boys can do ballet;
girls can play football.

45
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,505
Hell, the Green Bay
Packers have been

46
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,730
proving that for years.

47
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,420
That would've gotten
a big laugh at a sports bar.

48
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,422
Well, I say define
gender roles early.

49
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:05,674
All the other girls
got a pretty dress

50
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:08,294
and a cake when
they turned 14.

51
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,595
Me...

52
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,847
I want to go home, Daddy!

53
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,684
That direction is
nothing but wolves.

54
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:21,440
And 40 kilometers that way
is the mining town of Smithers.

55
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,259
I'd take my chances
with the wolves.

56
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,481
I'll see you in three days.

57
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,234
Well, wait, wh-what
am I supposed to eat?

58
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,287
Hey, you've got a knife,
the forest is full of animals--

59
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,072
what do you want, a buffet?

60
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,991
Papa...!

61
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,161
Happy birthday, son...!

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,998
Got any thoughts
on that, Doc?

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,867
<i>If you guys think I'm going near
that, you're crazy.</i>

64
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,836
Why'd you
emphasize "you're"?

65
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,113
No reason.
You're pretty.

66
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,001
By the way, do you guys want
to come over tomorrow night

67
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,226
for sangria and tapas?

68
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,240
<i>Si. Muchas gracias.
That sounds awesome.</i>

69
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:12,858
Great. We're also
gonna paint the nursery.

70
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,744
Oh, and a quick update
on the sangria and tapas--

71
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:17,413
that's cancelled.
Mmm...

72
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:18,447
Guess what smooth
son of a bitch

73
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,149
just picked up
a girl at the bar?

74
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:23,085
Barney, you're cheating
on Nora already?

75
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,520
<i>No, guys, it's me.</i>

76
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,321
Janet McIntyre.

77
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:27,506
Struck up a conversation
at the bar

78
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,591
while ordering, she guessed
bread right away,

79
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:31,985
we laughed, it was
a thing, boom, going

80
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:33,159
out tomorrow night.

81
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:36,598
- So, she said yes just like that?
- Just like that.

82
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,788
There's
something wrong with her.

83
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:39,013
No, no, no, no.

84
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,335
Stop it. They
always do this.

85
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:42,554
Every time I go
on a first date,

86
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,890
they snap right into
research mode.

87
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,358
<i>It started by accident.</i>

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,811
Ooh.

89
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,029
Hello?

90
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,232
Ted, we did a little
Internet research

91
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,533
on your Mia Plumley.

92
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:55,751
We just sent you

93
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:57,152
a picture of her
from six months ago.

94
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,138
I don't understand--
is Mia standing behind

95
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,541
this morbidly obese wo...
Oh, my God!

96
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,026
They had cookies and cream.

97
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,212
And what you were saying
about how women feel

98
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,698
they have to starve themselves
makes so much sense.

99
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,051
Ooh, hot dogs. Score!

100
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,254
<i>After that, background checks</i>

101
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:18,173
<i>became standard
operating procedure.</i>

102
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,259
The date with Nadine went great.

103
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,144
Unless you guys found something.

104
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:23,729
Are you sitting down?

105
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,714
No.

106
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,520
She's wanted in Florida
on crystal meth charges.

107
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,440
She breeds pit bulls
for dog fighting.

108
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,275
- Also, the FBI...
- What's this link?

109
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,327
Oh, she also writes
online movie reviews.

110
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:41,396
Anyway, she's still married to
a death row inmate convicted...

111
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:44,399
<i>She gave Annie Hall
two out of ten stars?</i>

112
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:46,702
"Slow and overrated"?

113
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:49,254
<i>Really? That's
your takeaway?</i>

114
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,423
It's the Wood Man at
the height of his powers.

115
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,376
The way he broke the fourth wall
by talking directly to camera?

116
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,261
People have been
ripping that off ever since.

117
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,882
Can you believe this guy?

118
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,350
Paula Vincenzo.

119
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:02,801
She's in the bathroom.

120
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,752
What's wrong with her?

121
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:05,721
Total psycho.
Her Facebook wall

122
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,924
has a link to a site about
dating inanimate objects.

123
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,926
For most of last year,
she was engaged...

124
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:13,278
to a mini fridge.
And there's pictures:

125
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,314
her and the mini
fridge on a hike,

126
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,366
her and the mini fridge
in wine country,

127
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:19,151
here's the mini fridge
meeting her parents...

128
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,903
Run like the wind.

129
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,492
So... want to go
back to my place?

130
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,544
Yeah, all right.

131
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:32,226
Well, thanks to us,
you ran screaming from

132
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,451
that freak show, right?

133
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:35,801
- Absolutely.
- Cuckoo!

134
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,004
So what's the problem?

135
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,055
You need us.

136
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,289
No, I don't, okay?

137
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,774
I don't want a
background check.

138
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,843
I want adventure
and excitement.

139
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,261
Look, if it's
a choice

140
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,113
between mystery
and history,

141
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,148
I want mystery.

142
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,550
In fact...

143
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,151
Ted, I wouldn't...

144
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,320
Uh, Janet.

145
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,523
I have a theory.
People don't get the chance

146
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,791
to just discover
each other anymore, so...

147
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,826
here's my idea.

148
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,244
Before we go out tomorrow,

149
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,997
let's not do any prior
Internet research on each other.

150
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,566
It sounds like I'm hiding something
horrible, doesn't it?

151
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,034
I'm pretty sure
you're a serial killer.

152
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,318
I'm not. I'm not.

153
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,337
It's just, you know, like,
when my parents met,

154
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,322
they didn't have the Internet--
they just went out

155
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,208
on a blind date
and fell in love.

156
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,093
That's nice.
And they're still together?

157
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,177
Right up to the divorce.

158
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,264
The point is, I'd love
to get to know you

159
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,566
in person, not on my computer.

160
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,518
I like that.
What started out

161
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,937
sounding really creepy
turned out really sweet.

162
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,107
That's kind of my move.

163
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:33,559
And she was

164
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,761
on board with the whole
"no Internet" thing?

165
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,729
She loved it.

166
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:39,865
The bitch is
hiding something.

167
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,733
The bitch is totally
hiding something.

168
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,378
Hey, Ted, before you leave--

169
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,197
is Janet McIntyre
M-A-C or M-C?

170
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,233
For the last time,
I don't want to know

171
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:53,834
anything about her
before the date.

172
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:56,754
You might want to see this,
Ted-- naked pictures.

173
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,589
That's not Janet.

174
00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:00,374
Who, now?

175
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:02,143
Seriously...

176
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:05,262
if you guys respect
me as a friend...

177
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:06,814
stop looking.

178
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,654
Well, Ted was pretty
clear there, so...

179
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:14,888
let's shut those laptops

180
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,391
and go help Lily and Marshall,
just like we promised.

181
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:18,859
Let's leave

182
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:22,413
the laptops here
and go paint that baby room.

183
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:25,766
Without laptops.

184
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:27,418
Or bring the laptops.
Either way.

185
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,903
This is exciting.

186
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:31,405
I give you...

187
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:34,258
the color our child
will grow up with.

188
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,511
Yellow, like the sun.

189
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:40,247
Or daughter.
Pun snuggle.

190
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:44,135
Oh, God, this room's about
to get its first spit-up.

191
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,270
Just open the envelope already!

192
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:48,522
Kevin, will you please
tell Barney that it is

193
00:07:48,524 --> 00:07:51,358
perfectly normal for us to want
to preserve the mystery.

194
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,861
I'm not here to analyze; I'm
here to win boyfriend points.

195
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,814
By the way, you all
look great, especially Robin.

196
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:58,949
Come on, if you don't
know the gender,

197
00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:01,485
you're gonna get generic crap
at the baby shower.

198
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:03,370
But if you do know the gender,

199
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:06,240
you'll get, oh,
I don't know, this!

200
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:07,792
Marshall! Lights!

201
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:10,628
Okay.

202
00:08:12,298 --> 00:08:15,232
When little Jack's
not turning double plays,

203
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,017
he's turning heads with this

204
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:19,069
home run of an outfit!

205
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:21,088
And if it's a little girl...

206
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,625
<i>This royal ensemble
may leave you speechless,</i>

207
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:26,260
but it's sure to make
little Sally say,

208
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:29,480
"I wuv you, Mommy,
and I wuv my dress,

209
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:33,134
and I would love
to see you in the shower."

210
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,486
Sorry, I kind of fell out of
character in that last part.

211
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:38,506
But if you don't
know the gender...

212
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:42,026
Little Fran is sure to be
the pariah of the playground

213
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:45,296
in this hermaphroditic
burlap sack.

214
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:47,398
♪ ♪

215
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,866
Marshall! Lights!

216
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:52,503
Barney,

217
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:54,955
you don't really care abo'.

218
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:55,706
No. You just

219
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,690
can't stand

220
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:58,259
not knowing something.

221
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:00,211
That's ridiculous!

222
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:01,929
Marshall, will you...

223
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,447
will you hold
these for a second?

224
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:04,548
Yeah, sure. Why?

225
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,383
Because I gots to know!

226
00:09:06,385 --> 00:09:08,435
Oh, Barney, no!
Help! Get him off of me!

227
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:11,055
Everybody hold it!
Hold it!

228
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:14,141
I found Janet McIntyre,
who's been widowed three times.

229
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:16,227
She's obviously
killing her husbands!

230
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:18,863
Oh, my God!

231
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,481
They're six minutes
into the date.

232
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,816
Ted's probably already told her
that he loves her!

233
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:24,368
We've got to get down there!

234
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:28,155
Nobody's going anywhere!

235
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:29,189
Why?!

236
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:30,708
<i>Kids, at that moment,</i>

237
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,693
<i>Kevin thought back
to his earlier rule...</i>

238
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:35,045
This real therapist
won't risk

239
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:37,197
upsetting his wonderful
new girlfriend

240
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:39,366
by analyzing her
wonderful friends.

241
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:41,068
<i>...and threw it out the window.</i>

242
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,304
You're all the most
codependent, incestuous,

243
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:45,639
controlling group of
people I've ever met!

244
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,427
By the way, you all look
great, especially Robin.

245
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,546
Oh, mm-mm.

246
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,184
This is so great.

247
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:59,052
Right? See, if we'd
researched each other,

248
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:01,155
we'd both be secretly
steering the conversation

249
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:02,489
one way or the other.

250
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,908
But this is
more exciting, right?

251
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,025
Way more exciting.

252
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:07,077
I mean, we can talk
about anything we want.

253
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:09,413
Anything.

254
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,900
So...

255
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:17,121
...how was the traffic
getting here?

256
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:19,173
You picked me up
at my apartment.

257
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,625
I certainly did.

258
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,128
<i>Oh, my God,</i>

259
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,913
<i>I've lost the ability to talk
to girls without the Internet.</i>

260
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:29,350
<i>My brain is
completely shutting down.</i>

261
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:31,918
So, are you folks gonna have
dinner or just drinks?

262
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:34,921
I-I don't know.

263
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:38,225
What the hell
was that, Kevin?

264
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:39,443
We're all crazy just because

265
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:40,945
I'm looking up some stuff
on the Internet,

266
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,929
and Barney wants
to know the baby's gender?

267
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:45,532
Well, to be honest,

268
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:47,701
I noticed some
other disturbing...

269
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:50,437
Never mind.

270
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:51,822
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

271
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:53,457
I gots to know!

272
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,793
Okay, last night alone...

273
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:58,212
When-When are you coming back?

274
00:10:58,214 --> 00:11:00,631
Because I miss you, silly!

275
00:11:03,218 --> 00:11:04,385
Wait, who's he talking to?

276
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:06,553
Shh, I'll be back soon.

277
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:08,455
Yeah, you want me
to bring you a pretzel?

278
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:13,227
Ted's texting me
from the bathroom.

279
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:16,430
Oh.

280
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:17,598
I don't get it.

281
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,817
- It's just a "C" with an apostrophe.
- Oh.

282
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:20,851
Oh, yeah.

283
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:23,270
Sometimes when one
of us is on the can,

284
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:25,823
we'll, uh, sneak a peek
and then text each other,

285
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:27,825
you know.

286
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:31,478
Symbols to describe what your
bowel movement looks like?

287
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:36,867
This morning,
I took an ampersand.

288
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:38,485
Last summer,
I dropped a deuce

289
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:40,754
that actually looked
like the number two!

290
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,593
When you worked
late Wednesday,

291
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:50,764
I... I got
lonely and...

292
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:54,000
<i>I watched Survivor
without you.</i>

293
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:58,105
Practically the only unhealthy
behavior I didn't see

294
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,724
from you people
was physical violence.

295
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:09,316
Yeah.

296
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:10,734
At least we don't do that.

297
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,153
And to top it off,

298
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:14,988
all the meddling
in Ted's love life,

299
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,356
not to mention Lily's pregnancy?

300
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:19,693
It all strikes me as
just deeply dysfunctional.

301
00:12:20,662 --> 00:12:22,880
So what you're saying is,
we're fine?

302
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:28,585
So, while this font is often

303
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:30,554
mistaken for Helvetica,

304
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:34,007
the fact is...

305
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:36,810
it's Helvetica Bold.

306
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:39,546
<i>I can actually hear the sound</i>

307
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:42,282
<i>of her vagina being boarded up.</i>

308
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:45,486
I got to be honest, Janet.

309
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:48,572
First of all...
this is Times New Roman.

310
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:50,891
Second, I'm having trouble

311
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:52,860
coming up with things
to talk about.

312
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:54,728
You? I'm sitting here thinking,

313
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,948
"Damn it, I wish I had something
as good as that font thing.

314
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,416
That's gold."

315
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:01,452
Guys, I'm so sorry
I said anything.

316
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:05,038
Um, you basically called
my friends mentally ill.

317
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,541
Yeah, you think some lame
apology will fix that?

318
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:10,260
What if I just paint the rest
of the room by myself?

319
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:12,679
Apology accepted.

320
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:14,047
Okay, let's do this.

321
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:15,682
Let-Let's find out
each other's likes and dislikes.

322
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:16,884
Start with something
totally random.

323
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:18,469
Like, um, oh, I don't know.

324
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:21,254
Are you a fan of--
I don't know--

325
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:23,273
<i>Annie Hall?</i>

326
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:26,226
I'm guessing that's not random
at all, and you use that movie

327
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:28,145
to test whether a girl is cool?

328
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:29,863
No, it's-it's the first movie
that popped into...

329
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,565
<i>I love Annie Hall.
Oh, thank God you're cool.</i>

330
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,400
<i>But just as things started</i>

331
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,452
<i>to go well
with Janet McIntyre...</i>

332
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:37,738
Whoa. I just found
Janet McIntyre.

333
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,957
<i>The Janet McIntyre.</i>

334
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:50,000
Sweet... mother... of God!

335
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:57,925
Uh, well, I got to
run to the restroom.

336
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:00,010
No internet, Mister.

337
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:01,795
If you find out my deep, dark
secret, I'll have to kill you.

338
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:03,347
It's just my friends
checking up on me.

339
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:05,349
I'll politely let them know
we're having a lovely time.

340
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:06,800
Okay.

341
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:10,687
Ted says, "I'm not clicking on
the link, so leave me alone."

342
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:13,357
And then either texted me a
bunch of symbols for profanity,

343
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,474
or got food poisoning

344
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:16,476
and dropped the weirdest deuce
of all time.

345
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:18,579
You guys have
to see this.

346
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,414
No. We're with
Ted on this.

347
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,315
We don't want to
find out about Janet,

348
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:24,985
just like we don't want to
find out about the baby.

349
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:26,336
Because we like mystery,

350
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:28,422
whether it's the hairy
majesty of Bigfoot,

351
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:31,458
or the bloodsucking ferocity
of the Chupacabra,

352
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,293
or the gender
of our little miracle.

353
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:34,628
Thanks for putting
those together

354
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,996
in the same
sentence, sweetie.

355
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:37,347
Mm.

356
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:40,050
Look, if you guys don't want
to know, how about this?

357
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:42,636
Let me look,
and I won't tell you.

358
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:44,438
Absolutely not.
Fine.

359
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:46,473
Baby, if it will shut him up,

360
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:47,558
what's the harm?

361
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,612
Can I...?

362
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:58,735
This may have been a mistake.

363
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:00,487
Boy!

364
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:01,855
Do I like babies!

365
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:03,407
Girl!

366
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,042
...friend,

367
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:06,860
your hair looks
fantastic!

368
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:09,079
Twins!

369
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:11,331
was the feel-good movie of 1988.

370
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,967
Okay, Barney, hey, it doesn't
matter what you guys say.

371
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:15,168
We're not gonna cave.

372
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,503
Yes, we are!

373
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:18,488
Oh, just open
your eyes.

374
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,974
This gender-neutral
yellow is horrible!

375
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:23,510
We're clearly gonna paint
over the whole thing!

376
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,545
That's what you want to hear.

377
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:26,980
I gots to know!

378
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:28,649
Yeah.

379
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:31,068
"It's a..."

380
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,986
It's a...

381
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:34,655
Where is the rest
of the card?

382
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,406
I ripped it in half.

383
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,391
I knew you'd be
desperate to see it,

384
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:39,693
and I'll give it to you.

385
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:42,863
All you have to do is admit
that mystery is stupid

386
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:46,333
by reading
about Janet McIntyre.

387
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:48,068
This is in no way
emotional extortion.

388
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,453
You guys are great.

389
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:51,588
Fine, we'll look
at your laptop.

390
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:55,375
Sweet...

391
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:58,011
mother... of God.

392
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,265
I can't really see
the computer screen.

393
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:03,300
It just went down
the wrong pipe.

394
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:07,688
<i>Whoa.</i>

395
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,973
<i>If Lily and Marshall want me
to click on it,</i>

396
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:12,776
<i>maybe Janet really does have
a deep, dark secret.</i>

397
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,195
What's going on?

398
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:16,363
I'm a prostitute.

399
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:17,281
You didn't think I was

400
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:18,398
actually into you, did you?

401
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,816
Sort of.

402
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:24,104
<i>Get it together, Mosby.</i>

403
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,008
Oh.

404
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:31,277
You don't buy beer,
you rent it.

405
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,713
Am I right?

406
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:34,131
This is the
men's room.

407
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,716
I know.

408
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:36,683
I'm a dude.

409
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:49,062
Listen, there's something
you should know.

410
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:51,315
I lied.

411
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:53,150
<i>I only kind of liked Annie Hall.</i>

412
00:16:57,271 --> 00:17:00,190
<i>I gots to know!</i>

413
00:17:04,662 --> 00:17:06,646
Sweet...

414
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:09,366
mother... of God.

415
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,624
Hey.

416
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:27,852
Ted, are you okay?
You look freaked out.

417
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:30,488
I'm not freaked out.

418
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,924
<i>I was freaked out. Why?</i>

419
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,893
<i>'Cause I had just discovered
that Janet McIntyre was...</i>

420
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:38,129
<i>amazing!</i>

421
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:03,387
<i>And just like that,
the wall went up.</i>

422
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:05,389
Okay, he looked at
Janet McIntyre's

423
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:07,258
Internet
extravaganza.

424
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,277
Here's the other half
of the card.

425
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:17,068
Wait. Should we
do this? I...

426
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,403
I don't know.
I mean, my soul says no,

427
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:21,956
but these hideous
yellow walls scream yes.

428
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,742
Should I just stop, or...?

429
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:27,245
Sweet mother of God!

430
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:30,631
A dog in Ottawa ran all the way
to Saskatoon!

431
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,783
What?

432
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:34,051
We figured out the Janet thing.

433
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:35,386
I'm catching up on Canada.

434
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:40,791
You're with me on this, right?

435
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:43,627
Otherwise, I can go down,
and I can get the card.

436
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:44,395
Absolutely.

437
00:18:44,397 --> 00:18:46,347
Oh, thank you.

438
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:50,685
<i>And so the gender
remained a secret,</i>

439
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:54,105
<i>but Janet McIntyre's life
no longer was.</i>

440
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:56,073
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

441
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,658
Ted, what's going on?

442
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,194
Nothing.

443
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:02,479
Did I mention
that I'm the youngest architect

444
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:04,916
in New York history
to have a skyscraper built?

445
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:06,650
Oh.
So, I'm not quite

446
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:09,170
as far beneath you
as you might think.

447
00:19:09,172 --> 00:19:11,205
Why would I think that?

448
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,624
No reason, but this one time
in sixth grade,

449
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:16,594
I saw a raccoon trapped
in a gutter, and I told my dad,

450
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:18,462
and the firemen came
and got it out,

451
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:21,432
so it's not like I pulled a baby
from a creek or anything,

452
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:22,683
but at least
I didn't ignore it

453
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:25,603
and keep lighting bugs on fire
with my magnifying glass.

454
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:27,722
We had one promise,
and you broke it.

455
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,590
What are you talking about?

456
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:31,508
You looked me up, and now
you find me intimidating.

457
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,778
Why-Why would I find you
intimidating, okay?

458
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,013
It's not like
I donated a kidney,

459
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:37,281
but I donated blood once,

460
00:19:37,283 --> 00:19:38,515
although I wound up fainting,

461
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:40,651
and they had to put it
all back in.

462
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:42,870
I was so excited about this.

463
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:46,157
But now you're just a blubbering
idiot like the rest of them.

464
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:47,625
No, I ain't!

465
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:50,711
I mean, no, I never do
that thing you says.

466
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:53,581
What I mean is,
you gooder than me

467
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,634
no make difference!

468
00:19:56,636 --> 00:19:59,053
<i>And that's that.</i>

469
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:01,422
I wish to God I'd never
clicked on that link.

470
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:02,840
I'm sorry, Ted.

471
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:04,708
We were just
trying to help.

472
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,094
I said it was meddling
and manipulative,

473
00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:09,096
but Kevin insisted we butt in.

474
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:14,185
No, it's my fault.

475
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:15,736
I never should have looked.

476
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:18,606
In the battle
of mystery versus history,

477
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,574
it's best
not to know.

478
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:23,244
Lily Pad?

479
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:24,779
What?

480
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:27,164
We're having a boy.

481
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,418
We're having a boy.

482
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,735
We're having a boy!
You're having a boy!

483
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:33,788
We're having a...
we're having a boy.

484
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,289
We're having a boy.

485
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,624
We're having
a boy.

486
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,010
I'll go buy
some blue paint.

487
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,503
It needs sharpening.

488
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:55,090
You see? I told you three days
would go by in no time.

489
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:56,758
Phineas, take us up!

490
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,176
Well, in case
you were wondering,

491
00:20:58,178 --> 00:21:00,479
it rained the entire time
I was in the Caribbean.

492
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:04,660
Thank you for asking.
