1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:04,270
<i>Kids, if there's one
big theme to this story--</i>

2
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:06,425
<i>and I swear,
we're totally, almost,</i>

3
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:08,927
<i>not really all that close
to the end-- it's timing.</i>

4
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:10,738
<i>Timing is everything.</i>

5
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:12,846
<i>For example, I never
would met your mother</i>

6
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,279
<i>if it weren't for a wedding.</i>

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,199
<i>The last wedding
I ever thought I'd be at.</i>

8
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:19,868
What do you think of this tie?

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,119
Oh, thank God.

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,905
Barney Stinson needs you
right before his wedding,

11
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:25,490
you assume there's at least
one dead hooker in the closet,

12
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,524
right?

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,081
Is this one better?

14
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,584
Look, the tie is great, and,
you know, it's perfectly normal

15
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:37,369
to have some
pre-wedding jitters.

16
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,037
I'm not having jitters.

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,556
It just occurs to me

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,508
that once I put this tie on,
I can never take it off.

19
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,345
I have to wear this tie
forever and ever.

20
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:47,930
And sure, this tie's skinny now,

21
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:50,649
but what happens if it gets fat
and starts bossing me around?

22
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,184
Did I make a mistake?

23
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,686
Would I have been happier
with the other tie?

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,608
Ted, can I tell you
a big secret?

25
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,577
Yeah, of course.

26
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:04,947
I'm not really talking
about the tie.

27
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,415
No, I got that, Barney.

28
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:09,918
I wonder if this whole
thing's a disaster.

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,704
What if this is
the worst wedding ever?

30
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:13,872
Not possible.

31
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,591
We've already been
to the worst wedding ever.

32
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:17,709
Punchy's wedding.

33
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,379
Marshall really took
a two flusher on that one.

34
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,397
<i>The story of how
Uncle Marshall ruined</i>

35
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,966
<i>my friend Punchy's wedding</i>

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,018
<i>starts in September, 2011.</i>

37
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,553
<i>Punchy had asked me
to be his best man.</i>

38
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,605
Hey.
Hey.

39
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:31,223
Guys, before we go,
would you mind

40
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,557
reading my wedding toast?

41
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,558
Oh, yeah, no problem.
Sure.

42
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,893
Um, all right,
if I have to.

43
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,112
All right.
Whoa.

44
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,565
There's a few
different versions.

45
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,951
Ted, why are you working
so hard on this toast?

46
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,453
Punchy belched his proposal

47
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:46,455
through a karaoke mic
at a bowling alley.

48
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:48,407
Okay, look, I've never
told you guys this,

49
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,910
but over the years, a few
of my old high school buddies

50
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,162
have asked me
to give wedding toasts,

51
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:58,467
and they haven't gone great.

52
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,303
<i>Somehow those weddings
all fell smack-dab</i>

53
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:03,472
<i>in the worst moments
of my life.</i>

54
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:06,508
Joel and Mora's love
is a beautiful thing.

55
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,611
I thought I had that...

56
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:13,482
till my fiancée left me
at the altar last week.

57
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:16,551
I was asked not to talk
about this, so I won't.

58
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,091
I sit outside her house
at night sometimes.

59
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:26,295
She got a haircut.

60
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:28,530
After I lost my job last week,

61
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,866
uh, I was asked not
to give this toast...

62
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:32,334
No, no, no!

63
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,202
The happy couple
needs to hear this.

64
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,238
Things end.

65
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,875
But from the ashes of your
statistically probable divorce,

66
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:42,878
hope can rise anew.

67
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,049
That is why I'm starting
my own architecture firm--

68
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:48,950
Mosbius Designs.

69
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:52,154
Mosbius Designs has failed.

70
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:56,425
But Alex and Jessica's love
reminds us that...

71
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,696
Oh, God!

72
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,150
Classic Schmosby.

73
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,904
Whoa. Punchy posted the low
points of your life online?

74
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:10,489
Oh, not just that.

75
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,691
? Mosbius Designs has failed ?

76
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,244
? But Alex and Jessica's love
reminds us that... ?

77
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:19,030
? Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha... ?

78
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,900
Oh, God!

79
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,836
So now I seem like
a total train wreck

80
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,871
to all my old
high school friends.

81
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,473
And a bunch of people
in Finland.

82
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,510
The auto-tune thing got
kind of big over there.

83
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,596
That's why I have
to nail this toast.

84
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:37,482
Ted, you want to nail
something at this wedding--

85
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,568
lose the Trapper Keeper.

86
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,719
The only thing you need
to bring to Cleveland

87
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,488
is this.

88
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,806
<i>That fall I became</i>

89
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,559
<i>the youngest architect
in the history of New York</i>

90
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,194
<i>to break ground
on a skyscraper.</i>

91
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,847
<i>Which led to a glowing
magazine feature.</i>

92
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,331
I planned on having it framed--

93
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,083
<i>Uncle Barney had
different plans.</i>

94
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,535
Here's your toast--

95
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,954
"Single file, ladies.
No fatties""

96
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:00,455
That's ridiculous.

97
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:01,838
Yeah, you're right.
It's Cleveland.

98
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:04,740
"Single file, ladies""

99
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,091
I'm not going
to Punchy's wedding

100
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,277
to brag about a magazine...

101
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,279
cover.

102
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,764
Barney, he doesn't need
dating advice from you.

103
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,784
You never even called Nora.

104
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:30,435
<i>Kids, you remember Nora.</i>

105
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,904
<i>But just the other day...</i>

106
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,074
I'll call you.
It's never too late, Barney.

107
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,793
Or did you call her?

108
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:39,611
Not that I care.
Did you?

109
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,213
I don't care. Did you?

110
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,415
I haven't called her.

111
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,417
Buddy.
Damn it, Barney.

112
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,118
I was really, really, really
rooting for you two.

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,336
Who wants hot wings?

114
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:49,554
I'm in.

115
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,756
Or maybe we should just pour
hot sauce on Barney,

116
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,141
since he's a total chicken.

117
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,843
I did not chicken out.

118
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,812
Nora is looking for
something serious.

119
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:57,878
I'm not. End of story.

120
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,855
And yes, Robin, I would
love some wings.

121
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,080
Cannibal.

122
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,901
Okay, next round's on me.

123
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,336
Oh, no, we got it.
No, no...

124
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,138
<i>Now Lily and Marshall
had just found out</i>

125
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,639
<i>they were having a baby.</i>

126
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,492
I can't wait to tell everyone.
Baby, no,

127
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:12,911
we can't tell anyone.
Not until three months.

128
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,312
I don't want to jinx it.

129
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,498
That's a bit superstitious,
don't you think?

130
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,451
Whenever we board a flight,
you lick the plane.

131
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,036
Have we crashed
even once?

132
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,339
Don't say a word until we
know everything's okay. Deal?

133
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:27,292
Deal. But everything's
just going to be great.

134
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,294
I promise.

135
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,463
How can you guarantee that?

136
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:35,884
Come here.

137
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,939
I'm just so happy.
I don't know how

138
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,608
we're going to keep this secret
for three months.

139
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,976
Relax. It'll be easy.

140
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,011
What'll you have?

141
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,114
Four beers, plus
one non-alcoholic.

142
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:52,767
You're pregnant!
Get in here!

143
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,619
<i>And so we all headed
to my hometown</i>

144
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,020
<i>where we planned to celebrate</i>

145
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,289
<i>Punchy's big day.</i>

146
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,940
<i>Uncle Barney had
different plans.</i>

147
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,325
Get ready, Cleveland.

148
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,160
The last man to
screw you this hard

149
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,129
then disappear
was LeBron James.

150
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,249
You're trying
to get laid here?

151
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,551
What?
God, Barney,

152
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:10,919
tonight is a magical night

153
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:12,888
between Ted's annoying
friend and what's-her-face.

154
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,089
Have some respect.

155
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:16,040
This isn't just getting laid.

156
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,709
This is market research.

157
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:22,046
You see, my legendary
success rate of 83%...

158
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,182
17-- it's always
the inverse.

159
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,984
...doesn't happen by accident.

160
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,069
Every single play
I run on women

161
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,604
has been
meticulously field-tested.

162
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,939
By weeding out

163
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:33,891
the bad plays in smaller markets
like Cleveland,

164
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,060
I know which ones will work
in New York.

165
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,028
For example,

166
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,397
tonight marks
the inaugural flight

167
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,750
of the escaped manslaughterer.

168
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,786
Are escaped
manslaughterers sexy?

169
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:45,903
Not even remotely.
No. No.

170
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,573
Exactly.
We'll never know unless

171
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,791
I try it out tonight.

172
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:51,459
Schmosby!
Oh!

173
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:54,179
Turd-faces! What's up?!

174
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,931
You really feel
that ring now.

175
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,415
So glad you all made it.

176
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,684
Open bar. Drink up,
turd-faces,

177
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,853
'cause Kelly's dad's
paying for all this,

178
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,139
and he hates my guts.

179
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:05,557
It's true.

180
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,642
Who's doing shots?
Come on, let's go.

181
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:08,926
Oh, no, thank you.

182
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,178
What are you pregnant
or something?

183
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,479
Let's get hammered!

184
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:14,766
You're drinking
for two tonight, baby.

185
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,203
I will do this for the child.

186
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,271
- Go Browns!
- Go Browns!

187
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,824
In AFC regular season play,

188
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:25,293
but if they mean the
Super Bowl, go Vikings.

189
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,795
Yowza!

190
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:30,665
Escaped manslaughterers--
not sexy.

191
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,500
Although in hindsight,

192
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:35,003
that was kind
of a flawed concept.

193
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:37,455
Next up, patient zero.

194
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:43,728
Lily, we are getting
sloshed tonight.

195
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,797
That's all you, baby.

196
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,732
I'll be four shots in
with no food.

197
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,397
In nine months, I'll be pushing
a pumpkin-headed Eriksen baby

198
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:51,622
out of my hoo-ha.

199
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,356
I think Papa can manage
a few extra cocktails.

200
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:56,157
Well played.

201
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,497
Hakuna Matata!

202
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,750
I, uh, I got
to get some air.

203
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,821
<i>Kids, remember how I told you</i>

204
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,073
<i>Marshall ruined
Punchy's wedding?</i>

205
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,341
<i>That wasn't it.</i>

206
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:15,644
God, will you look
at that guy.

207
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:18,013
I wish Barney

208
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,381
were my boyfriend again.

209
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:20,715
No, thanks.

210
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,557
Wait a minute.
That's your truth voice.

211
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:23,782
My what?

212
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:26,771
Whenever you're trying to pass
something off as a joke

213
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,125
but it's actually profoundly
true, you use that voice.

214
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:33,010
I wish the Spice Girls
would get back together.

215
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,646
They were awesome.

216
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,448
The worst.

217
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,871
That was me.

218
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:45,356
I totally cut one.

219
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,359
That guy.

220
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,745
Birthday present
from my dad.

221
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:51,991
All I really want is for him

222
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:53,816
to tell me that he loves me.

223
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,084
Just kidding.

224
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,419
This pen's enough.

225
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,203
It's not enough.

226
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,372
It's totally enough.

227
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:06,309
Oh, my God.

228
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:09,762
You still have
feelings for Barney.

229
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,446
Admit it, you still have
feelings for Barney.

230
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:18,376
You are drunker than I thought.

231
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:19,344
I mean,

232
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:21,563
look at the guy.
Wait, wait, wait.

233
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:24,215
Before you go, please answer
the following survey

234
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:26,268
to help me better
bang you in the future.

235
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,437
What didn't work for you
about this play?

236
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:30,939
Did you A) not believe

237
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:33,692
<i>I was a Guinness Book
world record holder?</i>

238
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:37,329
or B) did the fingernails
gross you out?

239
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:39,364
Th...

240
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:41,616
I can't wait for
your toast, Schmosby.

241
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:44,068
Yeah, here come
the waterworks.

242
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,705
Wait. You're rooting for me to
melt down at your own wedding?

243
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:48,089
Yeah, everyone is.

244
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:50,175
Plus a few new friends
from Finland.

245
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:54,963
Hey, good luck, Schmos.

246
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,798
Good luck, good luck.

247
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,934
Take it.

248
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:01,186
Show them how awesome you are.

249
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:05,857
Shamelessly plug yourself,
so you can shamelessly plug,

250
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,976
let's say that.
I told you,

251
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,694
I'm not here to brag, okay?

252
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,029
That's it.

253
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:13,114
You're too polite to brag.

254
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:14,866
Well, fine.

255
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:16,401
Let me.

256
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:19,537
Because the only person
on Earth

257
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,790
who loves Ted Mosby
more than Marshall Eriksen,

258
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:24,242
is drunk Marshall Eriksen.

259
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:25,994
So game on.

260
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,652
<i>Kids, remember how I told you</i>

261
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:36,187
<i>Marshall ruined Punchy
and Kelly's wedding?</i>

262
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:39,791
<i>That wasn't it either.</i>

263
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:42,978
Barney and I tried and failed.

264
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,295
That was two years ago.

265
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:46,464
Why would I ever
go down that road again?

266
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:47,899
It wouldn't even
make sense.

267
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:50,318
It doesn't have to make sense.
It's chemistry.

268
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,272
Look, I've always had a sixth
sense about these things.

269
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:56,157
And now that I'm pregnant...

270
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,994
with this idea
in my mind-uterus,

271
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:00,311
I see things
even clearer.

272
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:03,248
You and Barney have the kind
of chemistry

273
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,583
that just doesn't go away.

274
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:10,455
Really? Then why is he trying
to LeBron anything that moves?

275
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:11,673
Did this not work for you

276
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,491
because A) vampires
are played out,

277
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:16,461
or B) claiming that I also
invented Facebook

278
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:19,214
was kind of a hat on a hat?

279
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,667
You're the reason

280
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:24,168
he never called Nora.

281
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,504
You're the reason he's only
test-marketing tonight.

282
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:28,273
And you're the
reason he keeps

283
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:30,058
striking out on purpose.

284
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,493
Chemistry.

285
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:34,896
Whoa! Ted!

286
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:36,698
Is that really you

287
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,684
<i>on the cover of
New York magazine?</i>

288
00:11:39,686 --> 00:11:41,202
Now, you say "yes""

289
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:43,321
Please stop.
Schmosby.

290
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:44,372
What's this about a magazine?

291
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:46,324
You know what, Clay?
It's no big deal.

292
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:48,460
You know what?
It is a big deal.

293
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:53,248
Clay, my friend Ted is
designing a skyscraper, Clay.

294
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,883
What have you been
up to, Clay?

295
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:57,385
Well, I'm still working
at the rental car company...

296
00:11:57,387 --> 00:11:59,003
Bravo, bravo, Clay.

297
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:02,039
Any major publications
want to write an article

298
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,059
on your sweet
rental car gig?

299
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,510
No, no articles.

300
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:06,511
My life's pretty dull.

301
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:10,715
I guess the only news is
this little gal.

302
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:13,101
Oh, my God,
wook at the wittle baby.

303
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:14,853
She is so cute.

304
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:17,722
All I want to do
is put her little feet

305
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:20,391
in my mouth.

306
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:22,560
You've created something
truly beautiful.

307
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:24,579
She is my everything.

308
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:28,399
I mean, it's kind
of a big deal...

309
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:29,734
the building,
you know?

310
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:31,236
Hey, little one.

311
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:32,871
So, this little angel's
already sleeping

312
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:33,905
through the night?

313
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,790
I've had some
sleepless nights...

314
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:38,676
designing this building.

315
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:41,179
Aw...

316
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:43,465
Nothing symbolic
about that.

317
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,050
Let it go.

318
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,636
There is no chemistry left
between me and Barney.

319
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:49,754
We're done.

320
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:52,640
Oh really? Prove it.
Go tell him.

321
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:54,058
Why would I go
tell him that?

322
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,562
Because deep down, even if he
isn't aware of it himself,

323
00:12:57,564 --> 00:12:59,714
Barney wants to be with you.

324
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:01,149
And if it's not
gonna happen,

325
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,767
he deserves to know.

326
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,085
Fine.

327
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:10,241
Barney, just so everything
is crystal clear...

328
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:11,793
I know what you're gonna say.

329
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:14,796
Let's show Cleveland how
it's done.

330
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:18,633
? The chills that you spill
up my back ?

331
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:20,251
? Leave me filled
with satisfaction ?

332
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:23,087
? When we're done, satisfaction
of what's to come ?

333
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:27,242
<i>? I couldn't ask for another ?
? Uh-huh, uh-huh ?</i>

334
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:35,350
? Now I couldn't ask
for another ?

335
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:41,606
? Groove is in the heart ?

336
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:46,110
? Groove is in the heart ?

337
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,282
<i>? Groove is in the heart ?
? Ask your mama ?</i>

338
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:54,151
? Groove is in the heart ?

339
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:03,511
? One, two, three ?

340
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:11,419
? Groove is in
your heart ?

341
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:14,022
? Groove is in the heart ?

342
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,110
? Groove is in
the heart ?

343
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:21,863
? Groove is in the heart ?

344
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:26,401
? Groove is in the heart. ?

345
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,331
Barney... I...

346
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:44,752
Sorry.

347
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:49,190
Oh, my God, it's Nora.

348
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:55,942
Nora's finally
calling me back.

349
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:57,360
Wait, you said you
never called her.

350
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:59,579
I lied. I called her,
like, five times.

351
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:01,164
Wait, wait!

352
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,116
You of all people
know how much

353
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:06,002
I suck at these things.
You gotta help me. Please?

354
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:07,203
Just once I would like

355
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,038
to see what it feels like
to not screw things up.

356
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,207
Yeah, mm-hmm.

357
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,658
Okay.

358
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,295
Hey, Nora.
Thanks for calling me back.

359
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:19,665
Um, hey, hi.
The-the-the reason that, um,

360
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,167
I called is, uh...

361
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:22,935
To tell you how
I feel about you.

362
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,337
...to tell you how
I feel about you.

363
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:25,972
I know we didn't work
out the first time...

364
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,807
I know we didn't work out
the first time...

365
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,442
...and I know it doesn't
make any sense...

366
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:31,227
...and I know it doesn't
make any sense...

367
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:33,730
...but I can't shake the feeling
that we belong together.

368
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,148
...but I can't shake
this feeling

369
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,232
that we belong together.

370
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:38,985
Is there any part of you
that wants to try again?

371
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:41,520
Is there any part of you
that wants to try again?

372
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:51,280
Baby, I can't take it anymore.

373
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,032
I've gotta tell somebody
that we're pregnant.

374
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:54,300
Eriksen, stay strong.

375
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:55,885
We're keeping this secret.

376
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,387
There's babies everywhere.

377
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,971
It's like a minefield
of cuteness.

378
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,473
Look at this little bastard.

379
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:02,809
Marshall, stop it.
Stay strong.

380
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:06,212
You can't let holding some,
some little baby...

381
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:09,315
oh, with the cute
little cheeks

382
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:11,484
and the... the little arms

383
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:13,019
and little legs...

384
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:16,072
This son of a bitch
has knee dimples.

385
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:17,740
Let's go tell everyone
I'm pregnant.

386
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,192
Yeah!

387
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:40,346
You okay?

388
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:41,631
Nope. You?

389
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,800
Not excessively.

390
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:44,934
You want to talk
about it?

391
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:46,419
Not even a little.

392
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:49,555
Might make you feel better.

393
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:52,442
Okay, fine,
I'll make you a deal:

394
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,945
you go first, and then I'll
stick with my thing

395
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,447
about not talking about it.

396
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,799
Okay.

397
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:02,068
All my friends from high school,

398
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,870
they're here with their wives,
their kids.

399
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:07,606
Me? My date for the night
is a sticky magazine.

400
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,159
Sounds like high school
all over again.

401
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:11,794
Sorry, it was right there.

402
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:16,666
I used to believe in destiny,
you know?

403
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,586
I'd go to the bagel place,
see a pretty girl in line

404
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,556
reading my favorite novel,
whistling the song

405
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:25,975
that's been stuck in my head
all week and I'd think,

406
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:29,262
"Wow. Hey, maybe she's
the one."

407
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:31,647
Now I think, "I just know

408
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:32,965
"that bitch is gonna take

409
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,684
the last whole-wheat everything
bagel."

410
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,019
You've just been focused
on work.

411
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:41,073
No, it's more than that.

412
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:43,476
I've stopped believing.

413
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:45,695
Not in some depressed,

414
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,164
"I'm gonna cry
during my toast" way.

415
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,666
Not in a way I even noticed
until tonight.

416
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:57,156
It's just, every day,
I think I believe a little less

417
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,492
and a little less
and a little less.

418
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:02,478
And that... sucks.

419
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:07,633
What do I do
about that, Scherbatsky?

420
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:09,335
You're Ted Mosby.

421
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:11,354
You start believing again.

422
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,140
In what, destiny?

423
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:16,859
Chemistry.

424
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:20,313
If you have chemistry,
you only need one other thing.

425
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:21,531
What's that?

426
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,015
Timing.

427
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,685
But timing's a bitch.

428
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:31,624
Hey, we still have
our 40 deal, right?

429
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:33,159
If we're both still
single at 40...

430
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:35,027
I'm all yours.
Hmm

431
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:38,080
Unrelated, do architects make
big money?

432
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,666
Aggressively
medium money.

433
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:43,719
Damn it.

434
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:45,521
Schmosby, you're up
in two minutes.

435
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:48,558
Okay, promise me two things,

436
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,510
one) you start believing again,

437
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:54,614
and two) don't cry
during the toast, Schmosby.

438
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:57,049
I promise.

439
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:58,818
Good.

440
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:03,739
We're having a baby.

441
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:05,408
What, for real?

442
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,526
For real.

443
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:07,577
Oh!
Oh!

444
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:11,230
Attention, everyone!

445
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:13,082
It's time for the reason
we're all here tonight.

446
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:15,835
Schmosby's toast!

447
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:18,387
We're here tonight
to celebrate love.

448
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,793
Love brings us new life...

449
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:26,929
Hey!

450
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:32,785
This isn't a meltdown.

451
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:35,638
These are tears of joy.

452
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,092
Ted is happy for his friends

453
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:43,145
'cause he's the best guy
that I know.

454
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:44,447
And do you know why he's happy?

455
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,266
Because this beautiful lady
right here is pregnant.

456
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:48,701
How did you know that?!

457
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:50,903
That was supposed
to be a secret!

458
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:53,005
<i>Turns out...</i>

459
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:53,956
Go Browns!

460
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,325
Go Browns!
Whoo!

461
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:57,776
In AFC regular season play,

462
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:59,795
but if they mean the
Super Bowl, go Vikings.

463
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:01,447
How dare you.

464
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,799
That's my daughter,
you piece of garbage.

465
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,768
You're still gonna pay
for all this, right?

466
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,671
"Piece of garbage"?
That's my son.

467
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:12,108
<i>And that is how Marshall
destroyed Punchy's wedding.</i>

468
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,461
<i>But we didn't care.</i>

469
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:19,515
<i>There was gonna be a sixth
member of our little family.</i>

470
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:23,486
No wedding will ever,
ever be as bad

471
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,771
as that one, right?

472
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:28,824
I picked the right tie,
didn't I?

473
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:31,327
You nailed it.

474
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:34,847
And hey, just be glad
it's not the ducky tie.

475
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,265
<i>Ooh, the ducky tie.</i>

476
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,467
<i>That's a good story kids.
I'll get to that.</i>

477
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:41,203
<i>Man, we are not even close
to the end.</i>

478
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:46,058
You're a good
best man, Ted.

479
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,095
You're gonna cry during
the toast, aren't you?

480
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:49,995
Oh, I'm totally gonna cry.

481
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:51,881
Come in.

482
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:55,384
Ted, the bride wants to see you.

483
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:58,604
Okay.

484
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:02,608
Really? You're gonna go
with that tie?
