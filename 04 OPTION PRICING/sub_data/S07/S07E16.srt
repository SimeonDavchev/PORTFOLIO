1
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:05,430
Sorry this is
taking so long.

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:07,799
He kicked for everybody else.

3
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:10,405
It's hard for the little guy
to perform under pressure.

4
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:12,591
Top ten things Marshall
said on his wedding night.

5
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:15,577
Whoa! It was small, but
I think I felt something.

6
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:18,079
Top ten things Lily said
on her wedding night.

7
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:20,048
Stop laughing
at it, Lily.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,083
Top ten things Marshall said
on his wedding night!

9
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:23,268
Can we please talk
about something

10
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,386
other than my wedding night?

11
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:26,888
Absolutely. Let's talk
about last night.

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,257
It was a night
like any other.

13
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:31,259
I was just about
to get laid...

14
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:33,478
Hey, Barney,
I need your help.

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,113
This hottie I'm talking to
is meeting her friend

16
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:36,565
at a club,
so I need a wingman.

17
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,950
Well, just so you know, I'd be
giving up a sure thing here.

18
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:40,035
Hey!

19
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:41,870
<i>Are you not a sure thing?</i>

20
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:44,206
Yeah, I am.

21
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:47,626
This "friend" of yours
better be even hotter

22
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:49,127
and dumber than this one.

23
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:52,614
Wow! You have Enormous
Penis Syndrome?

24
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:54,666
I've never heard of that.
Yeah.

25
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:57,052
That's the problem with E.P.S.:
lack of awareness.

26
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,087
That's why I'm
organizing a 10K fun-run.

27
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:02,657
Of course, many of us
will need wheelbarrows.

28
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,959
You are so brave.

29
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,961
And you are so understanding.

30
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:08,930
Most people
just stare at me

31
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:11,900
like I'm some kind of freak
in reinforced underwear.

32
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:13,735
Poor, baby.

33
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:15,604
I can't imagine
what you're going through

34
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:17,138
because I never wear underwear.

35
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,490
Jackpot!

36
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:19,974
You want to get out of here?

37
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:22,577
Oh, I don't know. This is all
moving kind of fast. Okay.

38
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:24,079
Oh, but before we go,

39
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,031
I should mention my condition.

40
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:29,534
It's called: I'm Not
a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.

41
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:31,870
As the former Surgeon General,
I've got to say,

42
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,788
I don't think
that's the real thing.

43
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,040
Okay, just stop.

44
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:36,491
You have no chance with me.

45
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:38,460
We're just here as backups
for our friends.

46
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:39,594
Hey, how did you two meet,
anyway?

47
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:41,513
No, we're not doing
that first date dance

48
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,215
where you pretend everything
I say is fascinating,

49
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:45,884
thinking it'll somehow
get you into my pants.

50
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,802
What? Guys don't do that!

51
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:49,855
Goat cheese?
Fascinating!

52
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:52,140
What else
are you allergic to, huh?

53
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,344
You owe me three hours
for last night, Mosby.

54
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:57,979
I'm thinking,

55
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:01,316
laser tag tournament
in Newark this weekend.

56
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:03,351
Ted can pass for
under 18, right?

57
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:04,653
It's a father-son thing.

58
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:06,538
Marshall, we should
get going. Any later,

59
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,590
and we'll be riding the Drunk Train.
Oh.

60
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:09,407
The Drunk Train?

61
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:10,959
It's the last train
of the night

62
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:12,444
back to Long Island.
It's a mess.

63
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:13,795
Just a bunch of drunk,

64
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:17,232
sloppy idiots, fresh off a
night of partying in the city,

65
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:20,168
just desperate to hook up
with anything that moves.

66
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,086
Yeah.
Bye.

67
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:22,470
See you.

68
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:24,723
New plan, Ted.

69
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,758
So this father-son thing.

70
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,477
You know, a backwards baseball
cap really youngs me down.

71
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,562
All aboard!

72
00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:47,625
<i>- For Valentine's weekend,
Lily and Marshall invited</i>

73
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:49,961
<i>Kevin and Robin on a couple's
getaway to Vermont.</i>

74
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:52,046
Mmm.

75
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:54,465
16 years together,
and still so in love.

76
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:55,949
- Mm.
- What's your secret?

77
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:58,452
The key to relationships is
understanding the difference

78
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:00,304
between hearing
and listening.

79
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:01,722
It's about respecting
your partner's...

80
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:02,890
Opinions on...

81
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:05,476
Hey, shh, shh, shh.
Kind of on a roll here.

82
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,295
Relationships are
a give and take,

83
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:12,350
and that's why it's important
to never keep score.

84
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:13,334
Yeah, like how

85
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:14,568
Barney's holding
these three hours

86
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,686
over Ted's head.

87
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,905
If they were a couple,
they'd never work.

88
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:21,308
Obviously. Ted's a Taurus,
and Barney is such a Scorpio.

89
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,643
Good advice.
Don't keep score.

90
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:24,412
They're not even
close to finished.

91
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,701
How do we not keep
score, you ask?

92
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:26,415
Huh. Hm.

93
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,245
Sounds like somebody want
to hear some examples, sweetie.

94
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,951
Mm-hmm.

95
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:32,453
I'm just gonna close my
eyes until it's all over.

96
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:34,655
Top ten things Lily said
on her wedding night.

97
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:36,540
Solid.

98
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:37,758
Here's one.

99
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,044
Every time Marshall's
mom comes to visit us,

100
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:43,381
<i>we have to put out all
the tacky Minnesota gifts</i>

101
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,833
she's bought us over the years.

102
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:47,835
Hi, Mom!
Hi, Mrs. Eriksen!

103
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:50,104
Marshall.

104
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:54,141
Uh-huh. I don't see

105
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:57,445
the gopher-hair tea cozy
I made you.

106
00:03:57,447 --> 00:04:00,031
Guess it wasn't
good enough for Lily.

107
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,233
But I'd never hold
that over Marshall,

108
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:04,852
because if I did,
he'd owe me big-time.

109
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:07,405
Just like I would never
hold it over you

110
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:11,125
for dragging me to that
experimental theater piece.

111
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,669
Is it... is it
just screaming?

112
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:25,923
But we don't keep score.

113
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:28,041
Gotcha, loud and clear.
Don't keep score.

114
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:30,094
Because if we did, then
Marshall would owe me

115
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:31,729
for killing my
cousin's dog.

116
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:33,881
How did I know
that he would eat my wallet?

117
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:36,100
Why was your wallet filled
with chocolate?!

118
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:38,569
So we're back
to this argument!

119
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,721
<i>That night, Barney
and I found ourselves</i>

120
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:43,223
<i>in a strange,
new universe called...</i>

121
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,558
<i>The Drunk Train.</i>

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,494
Hey!

123
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,501
Where has this heavenly vehicle
been all my life?

124
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,036
Can you hear
its inspiring chant, Ted?

125
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:59,673
I think I can get laid,
I think I can get laid.

126
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,792
It's-it's The Little Engine
with Wood,

127
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:03,711
The Whore-ient Express.

128
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:05,078
The Long Island Tail Road!

129
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,098
Oh, I got one.

130
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,599
Thomas the Spank Engine!

131
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:11,018
Ted, that is a children's book.

132
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:16,974
Okay, as fun as this
place is, it's late.

133
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:18,025
So, what's our play?

134
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,443
And don't say, "The
Siamese Twins""

135
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,595
We're not stretching out
another one of my jackets.

136
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:23,614
No, dude, this is
the Drunk Train.

137
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:24,815
We don't need a play!

138
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:27,485
All we have to do is sit back,
play it cool,

139
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:30,154
scope out the hotties,
and by the end of the line,

140
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:33,273
we will totally be
sleeping with someone.

141
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,749
You know,
you are so great.

142
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:44,301
You sat there listening
to Marshall and Lily

143
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,787
bicker all night,
and you didn't complain once.

144
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:49,056
Well, I am a therapist,
so I do plan on billing them.

145
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:52,292
I also have a couple powerful
medications that might help.

146
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:53,594
Lily can't take anything;
she's pregnant.

147
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:55,062
I meant for us.

148
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,647
If we're getting through
five more meals

149
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:58,315
and a sleigh ride
with those guys,

150
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,817
we need to be spaced out
of our gourds.

151
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,819
Well, if we are keeping score,

152
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,304
I owe you one weekend, mister.

153
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:06,139
I was thinking
a little longer than that.

154
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,325
What do you mean?

155
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,914
Robin, will you marry me?

156
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,794
Look, I know this is fast.

157
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,996
I'm just excited
to start a life with you.

158
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:25,414
If that's what you want.

159
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:28,968
Wow.

160
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,719
Um...

161
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,389
I'm-I'm not saying no.

162
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:35,707
I'm-I'm not saying anything.

163
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,095
I just, um...
I-I need some time to think.

164
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:40,429
I totally understand.

165
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,481
Um, take as much time
as you need.

166
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:46,402
I'll just, uh... I'll just keep
this here until you're ready.

167
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:56,445
Any chance we could put
that bad boy away for now?

168
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:59,281
It's really just staring
at us, isn't it?

169
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,951
Ted! Ted! Ted!

170
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,286
I thought of some new
great names for the Drunk Train.

171
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:05,504
Slamtrak!

172
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:06,455
Uh-huh.

173
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:09,125
The Chatta-Nookie Choo-Choo!

174
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,743
Thomas the Spank Engine!
I said that one yesterday.

175
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:13,762
I don't think you did.

176
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:15,764
Wow. Someone's had some coffee.

177
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,249
Yeah. 18 cups!

178
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:19,935
There is no way
I'm falling asleep tonight!

179
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,471
That Quinn girl is so wrong.

180
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:24,473
She said I could never
love anything,

181
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,609
but I love this train!

182
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:29,261
She said you could never
love anything? That's intense.

183
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:31,647
Oh, you have no idea.

184
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:35,651
Stop staring.
Not gonna happen.

185
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:38,770
Is there any way we can start
over and get to know each other?

186
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,740
I already know you.
Oh, really?

187
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:44,543
- You wear a suit all the time.
- Obviously.

188
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:45,911
You have a stupid rule
about everything.

189
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:47,746
I pay for the meal,
you handle my deal.

190
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:48,964
That's just good manners.

191
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:51,383
But you end most nights
alone at a strip club,

192
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:52,968
feeling empty inside,
telling yourself

193
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,556
your life is somehow epic
or classic or... legendary.

194
00:07:57,558 --> 00:08:01,143
I never say epic or classic.

195
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,562
Do you practice the dark arts?

196
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:06,582
No, they did not
forget the potato salad

197
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,651
in your takeout order!

198
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:10,686
Wh-What happened next?!

199
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:12,304
For the last time, I'm sorry.

200
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:13,639
It's okay.

201
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,940
Your debt is paid.

202
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:17,526
You don't have to come
on the Drunk Train anymore.

203
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:19,195
You're never gonna meet
the one there, anyway.

204
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,447
- Oh, screw the one!
- What?

205
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:24,033
Every date I've been on lately
has been brutal.

206
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,951
Last week, I went out
with a girl

207
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:27,953
<i>whose favorite band was Glee.</i>

208
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,321
Plus, it's almost
Valentine's Day,

209
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:32,157
and I'm alone without
anything close to a girlfriend.

210
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,877
So... all aboard!

211
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,131
I have never been more proud
of you.

212
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,100
Come on.

213
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:43,335
Ted, tonight is gonna be epic--

214
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:46,272
wait for it-- dary! Wait.

215
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:47,389
No, that's not it.

216
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:49,692
How do I usually say it?
I hate this Quinn girl!

217
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,946
Well,

218
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,648
I propose we order
a bottle of wine.

219
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,533
- Propose!
- Not propose. Suggest.

220
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,735
I'm not married to the idea.
Lily, take it.

221
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:01,904
Why don't we get an appetizer?

222
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:04,406
How about the...
onion rings?

223
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,374
I mean, diamond rings.

224
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,626
I mean,
diamond circles.

225
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,295
<i>I mean, onion circles.</i>

226
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,462
I know they're fattening,

227
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:12,881
but I hear this place
has great onion circles.

228
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:16,368
So, Robin,
about not telling them?

229
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:21,023
The green salad
looks interesting.

230
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,393
You're so much better
without him.

231
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:27,096
If you ask me,
Vinnie's a real jerk.

232
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:28,847
Hey, don't you dare
badmouth Vinnie!

233
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,182
Ow!

234
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:31,400
So what do you do?

235
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:33,652
Well, I teach architecture,
and I also...

236
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:34,903
Oh, big man with a job.

237
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:36,272
You think yore better than me?

238
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:37,439
What...

239
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:42,194
So... where do you live?

240
00:09:42,196 --> 00:09:43,579
I'm on the
Upper West Side.

241
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:46,115
Oh, big man.
Living in Manhattan.

242
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,200
What, you think you're
better than me?

243
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:50,085
Ehhh!

244
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:56,292
Ehhhh!

245
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,076
You think you're
better than me?!

246
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:01,180
Well, it's a close one.

247
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:03,882
Lily made 14 awkward
references to marriage,

248
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:05,134
and Marshall made an even 60.

249
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,553
I'm so sorry, Kevin.

250
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:09,221
It's okay. I'm gonna
go to bed, but

251
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:11,357
you guys think tomorrow we can
stop with all the marriage talk?

252
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,424
I do.
I do.

253
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:14,760
That's a half a point each.

254
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,061
See you in a minute.

255
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:17,813
Okay.

256
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:19,097
So?

257
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,617
Are you any closer to deciding?
Ooh...

258
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:26,238
Uh... well, there is something
you don't know.

259
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,773
Um...

260
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:28,991
Can you guys keep a secret?

261
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,243
Yeah.
Well, some of us can.

262
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,462
Well, there's something

263
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:35,748
I have been keeping
from everyone

264
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,466
for the last couple of months.

265
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:39,635
Um...

266
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:42,671
I found out that
I can't have children.

267
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:48,143
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

268
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:49,179
Are you okay?

269
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:50,604
I can't believe
that we didn't know.

270
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:52,231
No, you know,
I've had some...

271
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:55,601
time to deal with this
by myself, and...

272
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:56,769
I'm okay.

273
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:57,903
For real.

274
00:10:57,905 --> 00:10:59,188
Are you sure?

275
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,323
Yeah. So...

276
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:03,409
even though I love Kevin

277
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:06,245
and I... think
I want to say yes,

278
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:08,280
I can't until I tell him.

279
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:09,248
But I'm scared

280
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,482
it'll end our relationship.

281
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:11,784
You
know what, Robin?

282
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:14,753
If it's meant to be,
then it won't matter.

283
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:17,489
Yeah, you just
have to tell him.

284
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,294
Thank God we had the keys
to Marshall and Lily's place.

285
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:24,996
Pretty sure I told you that before
you kicked in that side window.

286
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:29,768
You mean, before the "burglars"
kicked in that side window

287
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,721
and stole all
of Lily's underwear.

288
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:36,191
What the hell happened
on that train?

289
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:38,193
It was absolute chaos.

290
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:41,780
Ted, when I was at M.I.T.,
my favorite Einstein quote was:

291
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:44,366
"God doesn't play dice
with the universe."

292
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,768
You didn't go to M.I.T.

293
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,186
I didn't?

294
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:52,157
Huh. I actually have no idea
where you went to college.

295
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:54,960
Who are you?

296
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:59,248
If we analyze the seemingly
random patterns of the train,

297
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,700
taking into account
standard deviation,

298
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:04,553
and assuming that
epsilon approaches zero

299
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:06,555
as angle delta approaches pi,

300
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:08,590
we can conclude...

301
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:12,177
Damn it, Ted!

302
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:15,230
I was about to drop some
sweet word play about logarithms

303
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:17,900
and getting into a rhythm
with my log.

304
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:20,486
I'll remember it.

305
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:23,405
<i>The next morning, Robin
mustered up all her courage</i>

306
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:25,524
<i>and finally told Kevin
her secret.</i>

307
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,610
I know that this is a
lot to process, so...

308
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,662
you take all the
time you need.

309
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:33,916
And I understand...
Robin...

310
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:36,318
will you marry me?

311
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,403
Yes.

312
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:46,304
What are you doing?

313
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:48,522
The top speed of the Drunk Train
is 73 miles per hour,

314
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:51,692
and you factor in an aggregate
of 32 boobs per car,

315
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:53,828
28 of which are motorboatable,

316
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,163
and you divide that...
No, no, no!

317
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,365
This is all wrong!

318
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:01,401
It should be so simple!

319
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:04,338
I mean, it's the Drunk Train!

320
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,958
My God...
it's been

321
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,561
right in front of us
the whole time.

322
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,562
"Get drunk""

323
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:29,563
Yeah.

324
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:30,931
Of course.

325
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,400
Good circling, Ted.

326
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,903
This ain't my first
word search.

327
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,875
So my Mom's already
picked a date, venue

328
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:42,376
and caterer for
the wedding.

329
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:44,211
But nothing's
set in stone.

330
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:45,546
My great-aunt's gonna sing.

331
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:47,164
That's happening.

332
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,749
Are you really okay with this?

333
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:50,417
Yeah, she's actually got
a decent voice.

334
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,254
No, are you... are you okay

335
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:55,389
with everything
that we talked about?

336
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:57,591
Of course, Robin, I love you.

337
00:13:57,593 --> 00:14:00,477
Besides, there are other ways
to have kids.

338
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,762
There's adoption, surrogacy...

339
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:05,432
No, Kevin, it's not just
that I can't have kids,

340
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:07,501
I don't want kids.

341
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:10,154
Oh.

342
00:14:10,156 --> 00:14:11,689
Okay.

343
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:15,943
Knowing that, do you want
to take your proposal back?

344
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:18,128
Will you marry me?

345
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,315
Oh, you take such good care
of me.

346
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,651
Thanks for loaning me your shoes

347
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:25,536
for my swollen feet. Ah!

348
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:26,837
I owe you one.

349
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,339
We have to stop this.

350
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:29,456
Stop what?

351
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,625
Keeping score.

352
00:14:32,627 --> 00:14:35,930
You're growing a baby,
our baby.

353
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:39,683
So you're officially ahead
of me for life.

354
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:42,219
Oh, thanks, sweetie.

355
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:45,723
Once we're parents,
we have to be a team. Deal?

356
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:47,541
It's your turn!

357
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:50,444
I was on point for six straight
hours yesterday!

358
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:53,647
Two of those hours
were a nap and you know it!

359
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,449
Let's go to the board!

360
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:01,722
I hope
it's a soupy deuce, sucka.

361
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:06,327
Deal. We're a team.

362
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:13,417
I was all, "Do I look like
I'm from Ronkonkoma?!"

363
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,369
Oh...!

364
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:16,837
That's all you gotta say!

365
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,589
Oh, oh, oh, big man
with a briefcase!

366
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:20,424
What do you think,
you're better than me?!

367
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:24,378
Hey, our stop's next.

368
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,729
Do you want to join us?

369
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,315
Yeah, I think we do.
Nah, we're good.

370
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:29,883
Too skanky.

371
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,769
Too skanky?
Eh...

372
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:33,070
It's the Drunk Train.

373
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:35,072
You crossed out
all the stops

374
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:36,390
and wrote "Vaginaville."

375
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:38,659
That's not true.

376
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:41,195
That one says "Boner Gardens."

377
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:43,730
What's going on?

378
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:47,968
Wait. Did that Quinn girl shake
your game or something?

379
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,837
Hell no!

380
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,672
At the end of the night...

381
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:52,956
You know,
I went out tonight

382
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,010
looking for a cheap,
meaningless fling.

383
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:58,879
But you turned out
to be so special.

384
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:01,548
I'd hate to ruin this
friendship with sex.

385
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,952
Oh, oh, I am willing
to take that risk.

386
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,437
Good one, Ted.

387
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:09,773
Anyway, I'm seriously
contemplating purchasing

388
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:10,891
a new ironing board.

389
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:12,726
Do you think...?

390
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:18,649
Okay, I'll give you this: You
stood by your boy all night,

391
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:21,568
even though you have no chance
of getting with me.

392
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,153
That was pretty cool.

393
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:26,123
Yeah, you know, in retrospect,
I think that was the moment

394
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,076
you decided to come back
to my place and get nasty.

395
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:31,111
Yeah, right.

396
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:32,746
Get up. You're on my bra.

397
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:33,831
Sorry.

398
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,201
Where's your bathroom?

399
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:39,053
Past the kitchen, down the hall.

400
00:16:42,757 --> 00:16:44,791
See, I feel like
I would remember

401
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:47,644
you two being naked on your
couch in the middle of the club.

402
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:51,631
Oh, right. That was later in my
apartment after we got nasty.

403
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:52,649
My bad.

404
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:54,985
So, you want to go
to a diner or something?

405
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:56,186
Wait-wait-wait.
You slept with her?

406
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:57,738
I know, I know.

407
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,606
I'm late on sending
the pictures.

408
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:01,241
I've been swamped.

409
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:02,693
You like Quinn.
I...

410
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,862
That's why you can't stop
"complaining" about her.

411
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:07,814
That's why you just tanked
our chance with these...

412
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,867
lovely innocent flowers.

413
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,502
I don't even care
where we go,

414
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,670
but I hate doing it
on the ground.

415
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:15,956
Barney, do you know why

416
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,041
I'm on the Drunk Train
on Valentine's Day?

417
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:20,544
Because I have nothing
better to do.

418
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:22,713
No one I can't stop
thinking about.

419
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:25,699
So if you feel something
for Quinn, go for it.

420
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:28,552
Because you're wasting
your time here.

421
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:31,472
We both are.

422
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:35,442
I don't like Quinn!

423
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:39,196
Kevin, I love you,

424
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:41,064
but please don't
just be the nice guy

425
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,367
who says the right thing.

426
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,869
Robin, I want to marry you
no matter what.

427
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:48,322
Assuming you don't turn
into a big fat fattie.

428
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:49,323
See? Right there.

429
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,041
Don't always say
the right thing.

430
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:52,659
Look, you just got a truckload

431
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,394
of new information
dumped on you.

432
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:55,579
Will you marry me?

433
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:57,381
My feelings on kids
aren't gonna change.

434
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:58,332
Will you marry me?

435
00:17:58,334 --> 00:17:59,550
Haven't you always wanted kids?

436
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:01,368
That was before I fell in love
with you.

437
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,702
Well, that's the thing.

438
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:05,756
Your future always
had kids in it.

439
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:09,977
That is something huge you
would be giving up for me.

440
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:15,032
I just don't think I could
ever owe someone that much.

441
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:19,486
I'm scared that you'll...
wake up in-in a year

442
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:23,440
or ten or 50, full of regret.

443
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:28,078
So... I need you
to be sure, okay?

444
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,450
If we get married,
you will never have children.

445
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:36,303
Are you really okay with that?

446
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:44,077
Enormous Penis Syndrome?

447
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,262
E.P.S.

448
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:46,713
It's all about awareness.

449
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:49,550
That's why we're doing
the fun run, the silent auction,

450
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:50,601
the three-legged race.

451
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:53,604
Of course, that's just one guy.

452
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:57,090
You know what?

453
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,358
I can't do this.

454
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,644
You can let me
out up here.

455
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:02,446
Why? You got a girlfriend
or something?

456
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:06,316
Maybe something.

457
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:14,082
<i>Kids, sometimes you realize</i>

458
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:18,301
<i>the journey you've been taking
has reached its final stop.</i>

459
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,912
<i>Where do you go next?</i>

460
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:31,258
Hey.

461
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:34,228
Are you okay?

462
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,798
♪ A year from now,
we'll all be gone ♪

463
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,803
♪ All our friends
will move away ♪

464
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:49,293
♪ And they're going
to better places ♪

465
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:54,197
♪ But our friends
will be gone away... ♪

466
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,168
So... he un-proposed.

467
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,870
♪ Nothing is as it has been...

468
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:02,256
We're over.

469
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:06,426
And I-I... I-I know
it's for the best.

470
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:08,262
It's just...

471
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:12,549
I was finally ready
for something serious.

472
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:17,938
He seemed like the guy
to take that next step with.

473
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:22,326
But he couldn't look past this.

474
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:25,312
I mean, who could?

475
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:28,649
I could.

476
00:20:30,118 --> 00:20:32,852
I love you, Robin.

477
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:46,422
You've been complaining
about this Barney guy so much,

478
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:47,673
I'm starting to think
that you like him.

479
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:49,157
Like his apartment-- check.

480
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,494
Like his moves downtown--
check plus.

481
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:54,880
But like him? Ugh. Please.

482
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:57,299
I'm just surprised
he doesn't recognize you.

483
00:20:57,301 --> 00:20:59,334
He practically lives here.

484
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:01,020
Gentlemen, give it up for Karma.
