1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,265
Oh, God, guys, I'm
still really hungover.

2
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:05,635
Did I really
ruin a wedding?

3
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:08,004
No, you didn't ruin
a wedding.

4
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:09,406
Just the reception.

5
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:11,341
And the bar mitzvah next door.

6
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:13,026
And my dress.

7
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:15,278
And your dress. You put on
a dress at one point.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,614
Okay, you know what,
that's it.

9
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:20,283
I'm about to be a dad,
and I want to be

10
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:22,935
the kind of man that my
child can look up to.

11
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:25,405
So, sweeping declaration--

12
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:29,709
I am never getting drunk again
as long as I live.

13
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:31,777
I'm serious.

14
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,264
<i>Kids, it's not that
your Uncle Marshall</i>

15
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:35,565
<i>had a drinking problem.</i>

16
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:37,684
<i>But whenever he made a sweeping
declaration like that,</i>

17
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:39,519
<i>you pretty much knew...</i>

18
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:42,388
I did it again.

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,674
<i>But I'm getting ahead
of myself.</i>

20
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:47,844
What happened
to your leg?

21
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,312
Oh, nothing.

22
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,014
I'm meeting Nora
for coffee.

23
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:53,433
She's still mad at me, so
I need some sympathy points.

24
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:54,800
She likes musicals,
so I'm going

25
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:56,302
to tell her I fell off the stage

26
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:58,021
<i>during a performance
of Man of La Mancha.</i>

27
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,138
What do you think?

28
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,773
Lose the cast.

29
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:03,409
A one-man show-- I like it!

30
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,612
Just so we're clear--

31
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:08,832
this woman is mad at you
because you lied to her.

32
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,618
So your solution is to pretend
you broke your leg?

33
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,703
You're right.

34
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:15,872
A neck brace.
Thanks, Lil.

35
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:18,174
Man, I wish I'd have talked
to you sooner.

36
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:19,809
I've been practicing
with these crutches all day

37
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:21,845
and whoever left them
in my lobby

38
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:22,962
probably really
needs 'em.

39
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:25,164
Well, uh, I have
some good news.

40
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,551
As you all know, I recently
decided to get back out there

41
00:01:28,553 --> 00:01:31,454
and start dating again.
And, uh, well...

42
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:37,126
Is this you?

43
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:40,230
Uh, yeah. Hi.

44
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:41,364
I'm Ted.

45
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:42,632
- Hi.
- Hi.

46
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:44,784
That's great, Ted.

47
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:46,686
Yeah. Yeah, it was a moment
of pure destiny.

48
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:49,155
The kind you just
can't manufacture.

49
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:51,190
Or so I thought.

50
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:57,196
Oh, no.
How did I get on there?

51
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:59,148
Hi. Ted Mosby.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,367
Guilty.

53
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:03,169
Hi. Ted Mosby.

54
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:04,921
That is embarrassing.

55
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:09,142
<i>I should be on the cover of
Egg On My Face magazine.</i>

56
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:10,343
But I'm not.

57
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:12,478
I'm on the cover of this one.

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,631
Hi. Ted Mosby.

59
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,649
16 moments of pure destiny

60
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:19,352
in one day,
and of those 16,

61
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:21,437
ten were single.

62
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,607
Of those ten,
seven liked what they saw.

63
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:26,259
Of those seven,

64
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,227
four were women.

65
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:30,580
Of those four,

66
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:31,864
two gave me their real number.

67
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:34,667
And I have a date
with both of them.

68
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,452
Okay.

69
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,505
Guys,

70
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,140
it's Garrison Cootes.

71
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:43,092
<i>Kids, Garrison Cootes
was a senior partner</i>

72
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:44,744
<i>at Honeywell & Cootes.</i>

73
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:46,296
<i>One of the biggest
environmental law firms</i>

74
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:47,730
<i>in America.</i>

75
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,799
<i>Marshall would have given
anything to work there.</i>

76
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,135
If I don't get this job,
I might end up working

77
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,353
at, like, a Taco Bell somewhere.

78
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:54,854
And nobody wants that.

79
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:57,540
Or maybe you guys want that,
because you'll get free tacos,

80
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,891
'cause your my peeps.

81
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:02,312
But right now I need
all of you to calm down!

82
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,032
Hello.

83
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:07,700
Marshall, this is
Garrison Cootes.

84
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:09,535
Sorry I didn't get back
to you sooner,

85
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,738
but I've just been swamped.

86
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:15,775
Which is funny,
'cause I'm literally

87
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:17,577
standing in a swamp.

88
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:22,582
Anyway, I'm just out here,
I'm just collecting some samples

89
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,784
for this pollution case
we're working on.

90
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:26,753
I love the work you guys do.
That's a croc...

91
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:27,805
No, I mean it.

92
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,267
No, no, there's a crocodile
about five feet away from me.

93
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:31,808
So I'm just going to ignore

94
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,060
the hot urine filling
my waders as we speak,

95
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:36,462
and tell you that
we're very interested.

96
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:37,463
He's interested.

97
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:39,148
Obviously we have
to do some sort

98
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,434
of credit check, you know,
a criminal record

99
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:44,070
and Google search, but as long
as nothing unseemly turns up,

100
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:45,438
you're good to go, man.

101
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,357
That is fantastic, Mr. Cootes!

102
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,741
Well, I gotta run.

103
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:51,944
This is so funny,

104
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:55,748
because, actually, I physically
have to run now.

105
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,998
- Croc saw you?
- He's advancing, yeah.

106
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,634
<i>The next night,
Barney met Nora for coffee.</i>

107
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:17,070
<i>Thankfully, without
the ridiculous leg cast.</i>

108
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:20,106
Hey, Nora, thanks
for meeting me here.

109
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,257
What happened to your neck?

110
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,676
My wha...? Oh, it's nothing.

111
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:27,012
<i>I was performing in
a one-man show of Fiddler.</i>

112
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:28,781
There was this roof.

113
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:31,000
Wow, that one has
fantastic ta-tas.

114
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:32,151
What, where?

115
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:33,369
Oh... Oh, damn it.

116
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:34,504
Ta-ta.

117
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,689
Wait, Nora, wait...
No, look, please don't.

118
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:37,690
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

119
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,092
What is the matter with you?

120
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,127
What kind of person
needs to lie like that.

121
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:43,863
A person who really,
really likes you.

122
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:46,132
And suspects,
probably accurately,

123
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:47,717
that you're way
out of his league,

124
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,969
and so he feels the need to...

125
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,172
I'm sorry, you were kidding

126
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:54,557
about the fantastic
ta-tas, right?

127
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,697
'Cause I'm looking around
and I do not see 'em...

128
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:00,563
I just had two
back-to-back dates.

129
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:03,232
That's right,
two lovely ladies,

130
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:07,236
four large cappuccinos,
and... one sec.

131
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,407
And I don't know which
date was more awesome.

132
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,076
Let's meet the girls.

133
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,361
<i>Jessica is a Rhodes scholar.</i>

134
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,896
<i>She's traveled
all over the world.</i>

135
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:19,565
<i>Speaks four languages,
is a concert pianist.</i>

136
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:23,352
<i>And Claire reached
for the check.</i>

137
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:24,470
So I don't know.

138
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:25,805
It's a squeaker.

139
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:27,073
I mean, both
of these girls

140
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:29,926
have the potential to be
something really special.

141
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,880
They both move
on to the next round.

142
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:32,863
Wait a minute.

143
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,881
You're going to date
two girls at once?

144
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:36,632
Don't you think you should
just choose one

145
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:37,767
before it gets serious?

146
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:38,851
Define serious.

147
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,586
Well, that's complicated.

148
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:42,972
I guess you have to weigh
expectations,

149
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:44,223
emotional investments...

150
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:45,491
Third base.

151
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:46,893
Seriously, third base.

152
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:49,362
So I can go to second base with
both of these girls, no problem?

153
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:51,581
Oh, honk away, my friend.
Yeah, honk away.

154
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:53,816
Oh, no.

155
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:56,018
<i>Ever since Mr. Cootes mentioned
the background check,</i>

156
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,087
<i>Marshall had been
scouring the Internet.</i>

157
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,540
<i>Most of what he found
was pretty harmless.</i>

158
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:03,776
<i>In some cases,
really awesome, until...</i>

159
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:04,911
Not good.

160
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:07,413
This-- this is not good.

161
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,882
Thanks, Stacy.

162
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:12,135
Wesleyan has a new cafeteria,

163
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:14,086
thanks to the generous
endowment from--

164
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:15,471
Oh, ho-ho!

165
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:18,674
Did somebody say
generous endowment?

166
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:25,314
I'm Marshall Eriksen, but you
can call me Beercules!

167
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:35,140
Well, that could
be anybody.

168
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:43,684
Oh, man, I forgot
about Beercules.

169
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,122
Who made this
Web site anyway?

170
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:48,567
- Pete Durkenson.
- Of course.

171
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:51,712
Is that the guy who convinced
you to run across campus naked?

172
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:53,630
I was pledging his frat,

173
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:55,715
which I gave up on
after three days,

174
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:58,201
because frats are stupid
and elitist

175
00:06:58,203 --> 00:07:00,703
and also I found out
he wasn't in a frat.

176
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,755
Oh, my God.

177
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,057
This is awesome.

178
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,776
I just got invited
to the Architects' Ball,

179
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:10,229
the annual gala that honors
the city's greatest architects.

180
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,399
Oh, no, you guys see
why this sucks, right?

181
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,068
Because it's an annual gala

182
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,653
honoring the city's
greatest architects?

183
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:20,373
Robin, this is the social event
of the year.

184
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,742
You take a girl
to the Architects' Ball,

185
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:25,111
brother, you're going
to third base.

186
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,412
Whichever girl

187
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:27,914
I take as my date,

188
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,833
she will be
Miss Ted Mosby's girlfriend

189
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,402
by the end of the night.

190
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,421
Okay, no more sitting
on the fence.

191
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,590
Robin, get me my legal pad.

192
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,592
It's pros and cons time!

193
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:44,197
And kids, they really cheered.

194
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,482
Let me make one thing
very clear to you.

195
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:49,452
I don't date guys who lie to me.

196
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:51,654
Well, see, I did not
know that.

197
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:52,805
My bad.

198
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,774
So, from here on in,
no more lies.

199
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:57,677
I will never lie
to you again.

200
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,113
I'm serious. Ask me anything.

201
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:02,548
Okay.

202
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,616
Have you ever successfully

203
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:06,002
gotten a woman in bed
by lying to her?

204
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:08,621
Have I ever...

205
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:15,211
If I'm being totally honest...

206
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,715
Yes.

207
00:08:18,717 --> 00:08:20,633
More than once?

208
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:22,969
More than once...

209
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,054
Wow, that's...

210
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:30,059
I guess if we're
splitting hairs,

211
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:33,896
then, technically...
there was a plurality

212
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:38,201
to the times I've lied to women
for sex having purposes.

213
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,419
What were they?

214
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:41,421
Nines and tens mostly.

215
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:43,072
There was a four once.

216
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,457
She was a slump buster.

217
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,077
But, Nora, after that, I had a
run that you would not believe.

218
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:50,546
Man, honesty feels good.

219
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:52,231
What were the lies?

220
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,834
You want me to tell you every
lie I've ever told a woman

221
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:56,002
to get her into bed?

222
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:58,721
A bed or any other place
you had sex with her.

223
00:08:58,723 --> 00:08:59,956
Oh, you're good.

224
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,309
Pete, Pete. Hey.

225
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:05,428
Beercules!

226
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,712
Bring it in, dude.

227
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,848
Hey, I've been
trying to call you,

228
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,216
like, all night.

229
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:11,484
Oh, my God, sorry.

230
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:13,486
I would have answered,
but it is Tuesday night.

231
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:14,320
It's Sunday.

232
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,105
And you know what that means.

233
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:18,191
"Edward Forty Hands."

234
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:20,259
<i>Kids, "Edward Forty Hands"</i>

235
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,729
<i>is a game that involves taping
two 40-ounce bottles</i>

236
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:25,064
<i>of malt liquor to your hands.</i>

237
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,799
<i>The object is to finish
both bottle--</i>

238
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,701
<i>Oh, my God, why am
I telling you this?</i>

239
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:29,869
<i>Let's move on.</i>

240
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:33,405
Okay, you know that old video
of me streaking?

241
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,574
I watch it every day.

242
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,428
Well, I need you to take it down
off the Internet.

243
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,846
Like, right now.

244
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:41,580
There are two ways
that can happen.

245
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,716
One, you can give me
$4 million,

246
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:46,936
or... you can help me
go to the bathroom,

247
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:48,438
because I... I can't...

248
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,308
Yeah, those are two
non-negotiable no's.

249
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,277
Well, I'm sorry we could not
do business together.

250
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,561
But if you'll excuse me,

251
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,947
I'm in the middle of a game
of "Edward Forty Hands,"

252
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:00,032
and the competition is fierce.

253
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,768
Who are you
playing with, anyway?

254
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,938
Just myself.

255
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,541
<i>Meanwhile, Barney continued
listing every lie</i>

256
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:09,792
<i>he'd ever told to get laid.</i>

257
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:12,228
There's no time to explain
how I got bit there.

258
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,363
I just need someone
to suck the poison out.

259
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,532
The surgeons gave me a new face,

260
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:17,550
honey.

261
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,185
Aren't you relieved I'm alive?

262
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:21,921
<i>Me llamo David Beckham.</i>

263
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:24,707
<i>If I were
only casting The White Swan</i>

264
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,008
the role would be yours.

265
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,211
No, I am a lesbian.

266
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:31,114
This thing that I'm wearing
is just really lifelike.

267
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:32,849
Okay, let's skip ahead.

268
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:33,983
What's the worst one?

269
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:35,268
The lowest of the low?

270
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,686
The creme de la creepy?

271
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:40,490
<i>Uh... Oh, I once pulled
The Soul Man.</i>

272
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:43,826
There was this beautiful girl
who only dated black guys...

273
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:47,630
Barnell!
Ooh, I knew it!

274
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,834
I can't decide.

275
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:53,336
They're both awesome.

276
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:56,139
If only architects had
two balls, right, Ted?

277
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:58,007
I got this.

278
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,509
Ted, left or right?

279
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:00,826
Yes, yes, great idea.

280
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,461
Let the fates decide, huh?

281
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,614
I will pick left.

282
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:05,798
Just call one of 'em.

283
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,799
Ugh!

284
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,134
Ted, deep in your heart,

285
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:10,436
you know that you
kind of like one

286
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:11,304
more than the other.

287
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:12,805
Trust me-- take the other.

288
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:15,808
Um, maybe I haven't
this is...

289
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,177
the Architects'
Ball, Robin.

290
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,278
It's a star-studded event.

291
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,513
Okay, name one celebrity
who's gonna be there.

292
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,848
Uh... Lenny Kravitz.

293
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,300
Lenny Kravitz is gonna be there?

294
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:25,735
Yeah.
He's there every year.

295
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:26,953
And that guy's a rock star.

296
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:30,206
You know, Ted,
I've been thinking--

297
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,376
it's too soon to narrow it down
between these two girls.

298
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:34,493
Just take a friend.

299
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:37,330
Like I... I don't know,
maybe, uh, a friend

300
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:40,499
who had a poster of
Lenny Kravitz on her wall,

301
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:43,219
and may or may not
have, perhaps,

302
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:46,155
dated that poster, on and off,
throughout high school.

303
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:49,875
This pros and cons list
isn't cutting it.

304
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,212
I need a color chart.

305
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,431
Color chart! Color chart!

306
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,834
<i>And, kids,
we all really chanted.</i>

307
00:11:58,836 --> 00:11:59,852
Pete, please.

308
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,654
I'm unemployed.

309
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:02,939
I have a huge mortgage.

310
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:04,440
I have a baby on the way.

311
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:07,193
And now, I'm about
to lose a job I really need

312
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:09,078
because of a 15-year-old prank!

313
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,613
Ugh! Do you hear yourself?

314
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:12,081
Beercules, what happened?

315
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,316
You're like a different person.

316
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:16,168
The guy in that video
was awesome.

317
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,754
He had potential.

318
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:21,040
He could have been president of
the frat one day.

319
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,708
There was no frat!

320
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,876
Now he's just a bummer.

321
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:26,078
It's not like I want
to be a bummer.

322
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,598
I just... I have to be.

323
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,082
I'm gonna be a dad.

324
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,350
You'll have kids someday.

325
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:32,468
You'll understand.

326
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,087
Dude, I have four kids.

327
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,257
Pete, please take
the video down.

328
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:41,277
All right, Beercules,
I'll take the video down.

329
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,728
If...

330
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,815
you can best me in
a game of my own choosing.

331
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:47,066
Oh, no...

332
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:49,535
And I select the beautiful game,

333
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:50,769
the sweet science...

334
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,571
Pete, please,
I'm so hungover...

335
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:53,656
...the sport of kings...

336
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:55,625
I don't want to play
"Edward Forty Hands."

337
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:56,775
I was gonna say darts--

338
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,578
but "Edward Forty
Hands" it is!

339
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,381
And that concludes all
the space-related lies.

340
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:05,084
Let's move on to
the world of sports.

341
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:08,054
Oh, wait, sorry-- I just thought
of another space one.

342
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:10,389
"I've been bitten
by a moon snake.

343
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:12,958
You need to suck all the
space poison out of my--"

344
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,644
Okay, Barney, uh,

345
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:16,178
I have to be at work
tomorrow at 8:00,

346
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,847
which means I have
just about enough time

347
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:20,249
to sit in a shower for 11 hours,
hugging myself.

348
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:23,736
So this was fun.

349
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:24,954
Can I call you, or...?

350
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:28,107
Barney, you're funny, handsome

351
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:29,775
and really quite clever.

352
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:31,944
But you're also a sociopath.

353
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:33,846
Well, I count three pros
and one con, so...

354
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:36,332
How do you still think
you have a chance with me?

355
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:38,668
Because you sat
here all night.

356
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,820
You could've left right
away, but you didn't.

357
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:46,258
Look, Nora, all those lies--
that's the old me.

358
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,061
But I swear to you,
I am trying to change.

359
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:52,965
You... make me want to change.

360
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,851
How do I know that's not a lie?

361
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:57,570
I'll prove it.

362
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:59,438
I will prove how serious I am.

363
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,174
I will not leave this diner

364
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,378
until I get
a second date with you.

365
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,697
Good-bye, Barney.

366
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,532
I'm not kidding.

367
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:10,983
This is a 24-hour diner.

368
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:14,620
I'll stay here forever,
if I have to-- and I will!

369
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,190
Just water for me. Thanks.

370
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,496
Okay, so red indicates
level of attractiveness,

371
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:25,965
blue--
intellectual stimulation,

372
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,550
green-- emotional connection,

373
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:30,202
yellow-- compatibility
of life goals,

374
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,705
and purple-- whether or not
she reached for the check.

375
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,142
Well, it looks like
Jessica's ahead

376
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:38,210
in the first
four categories.

377
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,915
Did not reach for the check...

378
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,552
Oh, this?

379
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,221
No big deal. This...

380
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,856
This cost three
months rent,

381
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:52,525
and, uh, I've never
gotten to wear it,

382
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:55,361
because I bought it for that big
event that you invited me to,

383
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:56,895
which then fell through.

384
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,330
But, you know what?

385
00:14:58,332 --> 00:14:59,949
Don't feel guilty about that.

386
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:00,916
What big event?

387
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:02,067
That thing with your uncle.

388
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,853
His funeral?

389
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:05,704
It didn't fall through,

390
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,206
he miraculously
came out of a coma.

391
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,008
And I forgive you.

392
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,594
Now, can I please
meet Lenny Kravitz?

393
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,382
I did it again!

394
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:18,300
Aw, honey.

395
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:19,585
You got drunk again.

396
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:22,221
I can't believe
I took the over.

397
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:26,692
Just to be clear, "I did it
again" is not a reference...

398
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:29,261
to my current state of
inebriation.

399
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,430
What's it a reference to?

400
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,399
My name is Marshall Eriksen.

401
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,384
I'm 33 years old.

402
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:40,456
And if my potential future
employer, Garrison Cootes,

403
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,941
is watching this...

404
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,628
bow down to Beercules!

405
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,420
Well, that could
be anybody.

406
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:02,694
Oh, goodness.

407
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:11,985
Pete, this is Lily Aldrin.

408
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:13,719
I'm gonna make this real simple:

409
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,571
You're gonna take down
that video of Marshall.

410
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:16,972
You know why?

411
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:20,025
Because I'm friends with three
girls who dated you in college,

412
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:22,527
and girls
tell each other everything.

413
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:25,214
<i>Every tiny detail.</i>

414
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:26,532
Huh. So...

415
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:31,887
tick-tock, Pete-- tick-tock goes
the little wee-wee clock.

416
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:33,872
Pete's got a little wee-wee?

417
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,591
No idea.
What's everyone getting?

418
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:38,761
This was bound to
happen eventually.

419
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:41,730
I've been trying so hard
to suppress, like,

420
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,382
my carefree idiot side,

421
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:47,219
that it just rebelled
and came out swingin'!

422
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:48,387
It sure did.

423
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,773
Look at me! I'm a windmill!

424
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:53,943
Who am I kidding?
I'm not ready to be a dad.

425
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:56,779
I thought that I was,
but it's, like...

426
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:59,915
my dad never did stuff
like that, you know?

427
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,400
So what if he did?

428
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:03,285
You'd still love him.

429
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:06,922
And be honest-- wouldn't you
love to stumble onto a video

430
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:09,441
of him running down
the street naked, yelling,

431
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:11,176
"Hey, Marshall, look at me!

432
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:13,696
I got an icicle on my deal!"

433
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:19,218
Oh! Hey, guys!

434
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,919
Ow! My neck!

435
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:23,389
Uh... oh! Hey!

436
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:24,807
Look at that.

437
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,426
Barney, what are
you doing here?

438
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:30,529
Oh, I told Nora I wouldn't leave
until she gave me a second date,

439
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,814
and I mean it.

440
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,265
I've already been here
nine hours.

441
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:36,035
I still need
another minute.

442
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:39,288
I mean... call me crazy, but

443
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,890
I'm gonna stay here until
I get that girl back.

444
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,796
That-- that's
what I want.

445
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:50,299
The way Barney
feels about Nora--

446
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:51,950
I want that feeling again.

447
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:54,837
I don't want to be choosing
between two girls,

448
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,641
I want to be... a complete
head-over-heels idiot for one.

449
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,727
Yeah, the complete
head-over-heels idiot thing's

450
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:03,896
pretty nice.

451
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,315
It's not bad.

452
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:09,101
Although, for the record--

453
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:12,571
sweeping declaration!--

454
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:17,493
I am never getting
drunk again.

455
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:20,429
<i>And sure enough...</i>

456
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:22,331
All hail Beercules!

457
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:25,017
Yeah!

458
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:27,703
<i>But, again,
I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

459
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:38,013
Hello.

460
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:40,165
Marshall! Garrison Cootes.

461
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:41,333
Yes, Mr. Cootes.

462
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:42,651
Hi. How are you?

463
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:44,603
I just wanted to let you know,
we did the background check,

464
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:47,306
and that is
some disturbing streaking.

465
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:49,108
Sir, th-th-the thing is, um...

466
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,176
The rainbow streaking
in this sample

467
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:53,028
is definitely
from chemical runoff.

468
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,180
Oh, I...

469
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:58,183
Bottom line-- we'd love to have
you on board.

470
00:18:58,185 --> 00:18:59,201
That is fantastic!

471
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:01,353
Thank you, Mr. Cootes!

472
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:02,354
Well, you're welcome.

473
00:19:02,356 --> 00:19:04,156
And-- oh, and when
you're at the office,

474
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:06,408
try to wear some clothes,
okay, Beercules?

475
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,045
Wow! That's a big snake.

476
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:11,213
Oh, there's
a snake in the swamp?

477
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,664
No, I'm talking about
your penis.

478
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,982
See you tomorrow.

479
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:16,418
I got the job.

480
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,869
Yay!

481
00:19:17,871 --> 00:19:20,305
And I think that my boss
already sexually harassed me.

482
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:22,891
But he saw the video
and he doesn't care!

483
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:25,811
See that? Maybe Beercules
isn't so bad after all.

484
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:26,762
Yeah.

485
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:29,214
Hello?

486
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:31,733
Hey, Marshall,
my name is Pete Durkenson.

487
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,152
We went to Wesleyan together.

488
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:34,403
Yeah, no, I know.

489
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,605
Pete, we... we just
hung out yesterday.

490
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:38,824
All right, now Lily's message
makes a little more sense.

491
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:41,360
Listen, don't worry, bro,
I'm gonna take down the video.

492
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:42,578
You know what?

493
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,062
Leave it up.

494
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:45,831
Whatever you say, Beercules.

495
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,702
Scalpel.

496
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:52,921
You know what?
This is good.

497
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:55,340
I want our kid to see
every side of who I am.

498
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:56,592
Yeah.

499
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,076
Even the side that runs through

500
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:00,195
the East Village hangin' brain.

501
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:03,132
I'm gonna call Pete back.

502
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:04,550
That's a good idea.

503
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:07,752
<i>That evening, I took
Robin to the Architects' Ball.</i>

504
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:09,438
Thanks again for
taking me to this.

505
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,472
Mm. My pleasure.

506
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:11,773
And, you know, you might
find it interesting.

507
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,892
Some of these guys represent the
living history of New York--

508
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:15,260
Yeah, yeah.
Where's Lenny Kravitz?

509
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:16,928
Right there.

510
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,782
Leonard Kravitz,
world-renowned architect.

511
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:23,035
Guy's a rock star.

512
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,653
He's gonna be
giving his famous

513
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,038
90-minute lecture
on crossbeams.

514
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,539
Well, great.

515
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,825
I'm gonna go find one
and hang myself from it.

516
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:31,243
Okay.

517
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:34,129
<i>Kids, you can't talk
yourself into falling in love.</i>

518
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:36,948
<i>It doesn't take days
of deliberation.</i>

519
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,502
<i>When it's real,
you know pretty quickly,</i>

520
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:43,788
<i>and with absolute certainty.</i>

521
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:47,626
<i>I had forgotten that.</i>

522
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,978
But I was about to be reminded.

523
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,732
? Victoria ?

524
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:55,901
? Victoria... ?
