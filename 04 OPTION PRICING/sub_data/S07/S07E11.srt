1
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:04,171
<i>In the fall of 2011,
Lily and Marshall received</i>

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,205
<i>a surprising gift
from Lily's grandparents:</i>

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,957
<i>their house in Long Island.</i>

4
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:11,927
<i>Lily and Marshall decided to
sell it for one simple reason.</i>

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,295
It's Long Island.

6
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,681
I don't want to spend
my Saturday in Long Island.

7
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,966
I know, babe,

8
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:19,051
but the realtor staged the
place with fake furniture

9
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,437
and she wants us to check it
out before the open house.

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,455
All right.

11
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,473
Can we at least do it
on the fake bed?

12
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:27,443
I'm embarrassed
that you have to ask.

13
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,478
<i>So, they headed out
to Long Island,</i>

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,381
<i>and when they walked
in the door...</i>

15
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:34,183
We'll take it!

16
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,534
We-We can't take it.

17
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,369
We're the ones selling it.

18
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,538
We are selling it, right?

19
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,624
Baby, your grandparents gave
you this house outright.

20
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,692
So, the way I see it,
we have five options.

21
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:44,793
One: sell it.

22
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,996
Two: year-round
haunted house.

23
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:51,033
Three: giant fence around the
perimeter, chimp sanctuary.

24
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:52,367
There's already a tire
swing in the backyard.

25
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,670
Four: we destroy it
with sledgehammers.

26
00:00:54,672 --> 00:00:56,388
I like four.

27
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,808
Or five: we move in,
raise our children

28
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,877
and make this our family home.

29
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,230
Till they graduate.

30
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:07,099
Then we destroy it
with sledgehammers.

31
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,902
As a family.

32
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,854
No, this is crazy!

33
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:13,105
We are New York people.

34
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:15,724
We have a big, beautiful
apartment that we love.

35
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:16,825
You're right.

36
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,227
<i>But something happened</i>

37
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:19,612
to Lily and Marshall that day.

38
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,413
<i>Something that happens
to all New Yorkers</i>

39
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,250
<i>who return home from anywhere
other than New York.</i>

40
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:27,086
Their big, lovely apartment...

41
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,954
Huh. That's weird.

42
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:32,791
<i>...shrank.</i>

43
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:46,454
Okay, after Thanksgiving,
I'm cutting out carbs.

44
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:04,320
Now, kids, it had been
a rough couple weeks for Barney.

45
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,992
<i>First, he cheated
on his girlfriend with Robin,</i>

46
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,894
<i>then he broke up
with his girlfriend for Robin,</i>

47
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,795
<i>then Robin chose Kevin
over him.</i>

48
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,081
<i>So he was kind of
in a bad place.</i>

49
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,349
Hey.

50
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,467
You all right?

51
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,968
Why wouldn't I
be all right?

52
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,219
Barney's single again!

53
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,088
It's what America's
been clamoring for.

54
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,773
You just went
through a break-up.

55
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,358
That's usually when people
do something crazy.

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,277
If you were a girl,
you'd have cut bangs

57
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,228
and be dating you by now.

58
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,230
Just promise me
you won't do something crazy.

59
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,483
I promise I won't
do something crazy.

60
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,135
<i>Don't worry, he's gonna do
something crazy.</i>

61
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,788
In fact, I think
I'm done with girls.

62
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,773
I'm not sure I even
like them anymore.

63
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:40,458
Based on all the stuff you've
done to them over the years,

64
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,543
I'm not sure
you ever liked them.

65
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,411
I'm serious.

66
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,629
Come on, you love girls.

67
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,781
If anyone should be
done with girls, it's me.

68
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:48,282
Look at the year I've had.

69
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,218
Zoey, Victoria,
the Slutty Pumpkin.

70
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,637
Now I'm worried
you're gonna do something crazy.

71
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,472
I'm not gonna do
something crazy.

72
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:58,476
<i>And yes, I'm gonna do
something crazy, too.</i>

73
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,278
But girls, man.

74
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,646
Girls.

75
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,232
- You know what would kick ass?
- Being gay?

76
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:06,568
Being gay would kick ass!

77
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,403
Word. Guys understand
each other.

78
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,021
Imagine a relationship where,

79
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,990
instead of talking
about feelings all the time,

80
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,475
<i>you just play some Madden,
eat a pizza,</i>

81
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,277
give each other a happy,
roll over

82
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,912
and have some
cuddle-free shut-eye.

83
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:19,280
Bro, for what it's worth,

84
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,534
if we were both gay,
you'd be my first call.

85
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,502
Would you mind calling Marshall
and telling him that?

86
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,537
'Cause he thinks...

87
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,155
No, this is only in a scenario

88
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,457
where just you and I are gay,
not Marshall.

89
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,992
But if all three of us were gay,

90
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:32,677
you'd pick me
over Marshall, right?

91
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,479
If all three of us were gay?

92
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,350
Girlfriend, we would
all three of us have some fun.

93
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,385
Damn right we would.

94
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,639
We're not gay.

95
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,891
Nope. Stuck with girls.

96
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,260
I wish men could have children

97
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,779
on their own, like sea horses.

98
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,530
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

99
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,531
They have a little pouch.

100
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,949
They should be called
sea kangaroos.

101
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:57,786
No, y-you want kids?

102
00:03:57,788 --> 00:04:01,022
Maybe I've kind of
lately been thinking

103
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:04,292
about the whole
wife and kids thing.

104
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,077
Just minus the wife.

105
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,695
You could always go it alone.

106
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:09,864
<i>Like Mr. Drummond
on Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

107
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:13,001
Yeah, but that was the '80s,
when you could just swing by

108
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,836
any inner-city playground
in your limo

109
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,221
and scoop up some kids.
- Mmm.

110
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,390
- Simpler times.
- Hmm.

111
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,707
I guess it's better
to have someone

112
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,476
in it with you anyway, you know?
Lifetime partnership.

113
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,178
The only partnership in my life

114
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,513
that has stood the test of time
is this one.

115
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,349
The sacred bond of man and bro.

116
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,052
Maybe we should start
a family together.

117
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,157
Are you kidding?

118
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,026
This place is huge.

119
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,779
I mean, look, I can
dance all crazy in here.

120
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,414
Oh! Sh...

121
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,417
Listen, um, Robin,

122
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,368
are you okay with us all

123
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,421
doing Thanksgiving
out in East Meadow?

124
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,955
Uh, yeah, I guess
that'd be nice.

125
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,123
Oh, great!

126
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,292
And then after Thanksgiving,
Lily and I were thinking

127
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,410
that we would just
stay at the house

128
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,346
until, you know...

129
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,914
we die.

130
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,132
What?

131
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,717
No!

132
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,103
You can't move
to Long Island!

133
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,055
But this house
is so nice.

134
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,975
It's big, and it's clean,
and if there's cockroaches,

135
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,561
they respect us enough
to sneak around.

136
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,646
Listen to yourself.

137
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,098
This is Pregnancy Brain
all over again.

138
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,867
No, I'm done
with Pregnancy Brain.

139
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:22,954
I've moved on
to weird pregnancy sex dreams.

140
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,539
Officer.

141
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,742
You know. You know.

142
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,213
I'm-I'm just saying, you're not
in the right mind to be making

143
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:33,331
this decision
right now.

144
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,966
You know what? Robin's right.

145
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,119
We are in no state of mind
to make this kind of decision.

146
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,672
Thank you. And now you're
stepping off the crazy bus.

147
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,223
We let the universe decide.

148
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:43,675
And now you're back on board.

149
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,260
You hear that, Universe?

150
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,596
If you send us a sign
in the next...

151
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,683
24 hours, then we're moving
to Long Island!

152
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,401
Okay?

153
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:54,319
Go.

154
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,469
Hey, guys,

155
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:57,188
for the last time,
this place is enormous--

156
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,189
Oh!

157
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,575
Geez, how many lamps
do you have?

158
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,827
It's genius!

159
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,413
Instead of throwing away
your life marrying some girl,

160
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:08,666
you just go splitsies on a kid
with your best bro!

161
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,751
I wouldn't have to choose

162
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,652
between dating
and having a family.

163
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:14,322
Hell, I could bring
the kids on dates!

164
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:15,507
And a broken home?

165
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,791
Um, what's that?

166
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,926
Our kids will never know,

167
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:19,493
'cause we're never
gonna split up!

168
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,512
Why would we?

169
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,930
I mean, sure,
when your wife walks in

170
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:23,998
on you banging a hot flight
attendant, you get a divorce.

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,666
But when your bro-parent
walks in on you

172
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:27,001
banging a hot
flight attendant...

173
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:29,270
You get five of these bad boys,
right up high!

174
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:32,190
And you totally
join in, right?!

175
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,008
Oh, no, there's the line.
That's the line.

176
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,110
We found the line.
It's good we know where it is.

177
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:37,145
Hey, guys.

178
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,530
- Hey!
- Hey.

179
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,665
We have an announcement.

180
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,567
So what you're
saying is,

181
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,786
if you're meant to move
to Long Island,

182
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,154
some sign from the universe

183
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,789
will magically appear
at your doorstep?

184
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,908
<i>Now, kids, I don't think
there was a knock on the door</i>

185
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,477
<i>at that exact moment, but for
the purposes of this story...</i>

186
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,298
Hi, I'm Clive.

187
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,716
I live upstairs from you.

188
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,802
Is this your sign?

189
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:03,838
I don't know, Clive.

190
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,206
Is it?

191
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,058
Oh, did we leave that outside?

192
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,677
Yeah, we're selling our house
in Long Island.

193
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,846
Oh. Too bad you're not
selling this place.

194
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,598
I'd love to turn
mine into a duplex.

195
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,716
And I'd give you a really
good price for it,

196
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:17,785
because I am so rich.

197
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,755
He did not
say that.

198
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,156
His shoes did.

199
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,492
Okay, the point is,
we got the sign.

200
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,778
We're moving to East Meadow.

201
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:28,613
Let's get some champagne.

202
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,281
<i>And just like that,
Lily and Marshall</i>

203
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,916
<i>were beginning a new chapter
in their lives.</i>

204
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,085
<i>Which meant only one thing
for us...</i>

205
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,954
We're having a baby!

206
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,738
Bro-parents activate!

207
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,975
- Hey, let's talk baby names!
- Barney...

208
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:47,826
Oh, my God!
That was my first choice, too.

209
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:51,229
No, listen.
You and I are drunk.

210
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,833
Which means there's a chance
that adopting a baby--

211
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:57,035
no matter how cute
he is in my head

212
00:07:57,037 --> 00:08:00,205
with his little cowboy outfit on
and he's riding our dog

213
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,757
like a horse
and we also have a dog,

214
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,543
purebred Golden,
but it's okay, she's a rescue--

215
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:07,345
might not be a good idea.

216
00:08:07,347 --> 00:08:09,381
You're right.

217
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:12,517
So let's go home,
take some aspirin,

218
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,752
drink lots of water,

219
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:17,806
and then see if it's still
a good idea tomorrow.

220
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:19,724
It's still a good idea!

221
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:21,309
It's totally still
a good idea!

222
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:22,644
We're having a baby!

223
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,481
<i>Kids, I cannot
stress this enough:</i>

224
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:29,117
<i>Barney and I were going
through a tough time.</i>

225
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:31,436
You're not leaving,
and that's final.

226
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:35,440
Look what I bought at
4:00 a.m. in New York City.

227
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:40,078
A bootleg VHS of a very,
very popular Korean movie,

228
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,947
this genuine Lenny Vintone purse

229
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:46,117
and the number of a man
who can get me a kidney.

230
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,502
Do that on Long Island.

231
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:50,672
Look, Robin, we appreciate
that you want us

232
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:53,258
to stay in the city, but
this is what we want.

233
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,809
I mean, you
understand, right?

234
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:57,228
No.

235
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,813
Here are a
few fun facts

236
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:01,016
about Long Island.

237
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:03,735
Number one:
it's Brooklyn's fart trail.

238
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:05,803
<i>So Barney and I--</i>

239
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:07,638
<i>and again,
going through a tough time,</i>

240
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,990
<i>can't stress that enough--</i>

241
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:10,692
<i>found an adoption agency
Web site</i>

242
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:12,911
<i>and filled out
their online application.</i>

243
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:15,697
Name: Barney Stinson.

244
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:17,532
Ted Mosby.

245
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:18,500
Address...

246
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:20,001
Oh, put my address
in Westchester.

247
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:21,286
They'll want to see we'll be

248
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:22,921
raising this child
in a good environment.

249
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,089
You know, the suburbs.

250
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:25,423
What? No.

251
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:28,126
- All my guys are here.
- Your guys?

252
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:29,928
Yeah. You know how I got
a guy for everything?

253
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,212
Well, they're all in New York.

254
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:33,298
My suit guy, my shoe guy,
my ticket guy, my club guy.

255
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,832
And if I don't have
a guy for something,

256
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,634
then I have a guy guy
to get me a guy.

257
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,470
And oddly enough,
his name is Guy.

258
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:40,338
Okay, fine.
How about this?

259
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,174
We stay in the city during
the week, then on the weekend,

260
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:44,476
country house in the burbs!

261
00:09:44,478 --> 00:09:46,978
This is why bro-parenting works!

262
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,896
Totally!

263
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:50,148
And with your salary
plus my salary,

264
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,183
we can totally
afford two places.

265
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:54,202
Oh.

266
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:55,470
What?

267
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:59,741
So... uh, you're gonna
keep your job?

268
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:03,461
Robin, this discussion
is closed.

269
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:05,880
The universe told us to do it,
so we're doing it.

270
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, the universe
gets it wrong sometimes.

271
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:11,252
Remember when Marshall
was trying to decide between

272
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:13,838
becoming an environmental lawyer
and working at a bank?

273
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,573
<i>That's a funny story.</i>

274
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:18,009
<i>Marshall was fed up
with his job at GNB and was</i>

275
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,344
<i>thinking about
leaving it all behind,</i>

276
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:21,379
<i>so he and Lily agreed
he should wait for a sign</i>

277
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:23,231
<i>from the universe
to tell him what to do.</i>

278
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,933
<i>Then one day...</i>

279
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,276
Of course.

280
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:36,444
It's so clear.

281
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:38,163
It's been right there all along.

282
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:39,897
I have to call Lily.

283
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,033
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

284
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:45,086
I'm sorry, but, um, can
I please borrow your...

285
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:47,872
- Ernie Hudson?
- Yes.

286
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:50,008
Can I borrow your phone?

287
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,243
Who you gonna call?

288
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,431
And did Marshall
become a Ghostbuster?

289
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,500
That firehouse
is still for sale.

290
00:10:58,502 --> 00:11:01,419
Even Ernie Hudson begged you
not to go through with that.

291
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:02,720
Ernie Hudson is a coward!

292
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:04,389
Oh!

293
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:05,623
Of course I'm gonna
keep my job.

294
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,791
Why wouldn't
I keep my job?

295
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:10,862
Well, I mean,
this whole architecture thing...

296
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:12,480
isn't it more of a hobby?

297
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:13,948
Excuse me?

298
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,567
And now we're fighting.
You know what?

299
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:17,218
Forget I said anything.

300
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,654
No! No, no, no.
We're having this discussion.

301
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:20,938
Architecture
is my life's work.

302
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,874
<i>Why don't you quit your job?
I don't even know</i>

303
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,626
what it is
you do for a living.

304
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:27,045
"What it is I do for a living?"

305
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:32,167
I work, Ted, 14 hours a day
so that our baby can have food

306
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,419
and clothes and a nice house,

307
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:36,287
while you sit around
doodling pictures of buildings.

308
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:37,806
That's "what it is I do."

309
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:40,425
You know what? Screw this.
I'm gonna go to the bar.

310
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:42,227
Yeah, right, right,
'cause the answer's always

311
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:44,095
at the bottom of a bottle!

312
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:46,898
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold it!

313
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,851
Brainstorm.
Brainstorm.

314
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:52,587
Nobody quits their job.

315
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:53,688
We get a nanny.

316
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,689
Dibs on the nanny.

317
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:56,074
No. No banging the nanny.

318
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,109
Ted, please don not dig in
on this whole

319
00:11:58,111 --> 00:11:59,160
no-banging-the-nanny policy.

320
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:00,745
Okay, fine.
We'll get two nannies.

321
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:03,164
One for banging,
one for childcare.

322
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,149
Slash banging.
Dibs on both nannies!

323
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:07,285
Just think of it, Ted,
you and me,

324
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:09,587
living together,
with our kid,

325
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,060
my two hot nannies,
our pet cobra...

326
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:12,671
What?

327
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:15,009
A kid needs a pet cobra, Ted.
Don't be a pill about this.

328
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:17,345
And we'll have amazing
weeklong parties,

329
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:20,215
and there'll be swords
and ninja stars lying around.

330
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,549
<i>That's when I realized:</i>

331
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:24,602
<i>adopting a baby with a friend?
Crazy.</i>

332
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:28,506
<i>Adopting a baby with Barney?
Freaking nuts.</i>

333
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:30,725
I can't adopt a baby with you,
Barney.

334
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:31,776
Why not?

335
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:33,394
Because we don't even
have one yet

336
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:34,863
and you're already
a terrible father.

337
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:36,981
Oh, I get it.

338
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:38,900
You want one of the nannies.

339
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:40,851
Well, you can't have 'em!
They're mine!

340
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:43,738
So you're just gonna have
to get yourself a third nanny.

341
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,574
Except dibs on
the third nanny! Good day!

342
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:49,627
<i>Which brings us
to Thanksgiving.</i>

343
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:51,913
<i>Marshall, Lily and Robin
were heading out</i>

344
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:53,882
<i>to Long Island early
to get ready.</i>

345
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:03,224
Okay, how is this
even possible?!

346
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:06,144
'Cause how did we even get it
in here?!

347
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:11,215
Okay, I change my mind.
I want an epidural.

348
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:13,484
You guys are crazy.

349
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:15,853
This place is enormous.

350
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:17,405
I mean, look arou...

351
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:20,108
Have you never heard
of overhead lighting?!

352
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,530
You're right.

353
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:27,115
I get it.

354
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:30,201
This place is great.

355
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:32,754
Um, excuse me.
Where is the restroom?

356
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:35,373
Oh. Right there.
Oh, good, great.

357
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,925
I'm just gonna go
in there and...

358
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:40,178
not come out until you promise
never to move away!

359
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:44,432
It's a good thing
we have three bathrooms.

360
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,385
Hey, Barney.

361
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:49,086
Uh, listen, sorry
about the other day

362
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,022
when I said you'd be
a terrible father.

363
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:53,308
You had no reason
to think otherwise.

364
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,809
Totally understandable.
I'm not mad.

365
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:55,944
Thanks.

366
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:57,078
And, uh, let's be honest,

367
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,529
we were both acting
a little crazy.

368
00:13:58,531 --> 00:14:00,565
I don't think either of us
is truly ready

369
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,099
for the responsibility of...

370
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:04,652
Daddy's home.

371
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,647
Uh, Barney, uh, where
did you get this baby?

372
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:14,120
Please.

373
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,370
Did you adopt it?

374
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:16,421
Please.

375
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,723
Do you have
a baby guy?

376
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:22,010
Did Guy the guy guy
get you a baby guy?

377
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:23,744
Ted, we should get going.

378
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:26,097
No, no, no. I'm not going
anywhere with you.

379
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,582
For all I know, I could be

380
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:28,850
aiding and abetting
a kidnapping.

381
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,635
Shh. Bro-daddy's not mad.

382
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:35,273
He's just being a wittle loud.
He wuvs you! Yes, he does!

383
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,425
- This is insane!
- You'll feel better outside.

384
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:39,310
- Come on.
- No, I can't.

385
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,895
Yeah. Na-na-na.

386
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:44,232
<i>But then we went outside.</i>

387
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,483
Oh, my goodness.

388
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,485
- What a beautiful baby.
- Thank you.

389
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,770
By the way, my friend and I,
we're not a couple.

390
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:51,739
We are two straight guys
who are single

391
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,908
and we have a baby.
Just so you know.

392
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,211
Look at this sweet girl.

393
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:58,213
Hi. I was just telling
this first girl,

394
00:14:58,215 --> 00:15:00,048
my friend and I,
both straight,

395
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,133
both available,
and we have a baby.

396
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,635
Oh, who is this little angel?

397
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:04,919
me and him,

398
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,504
not gay, single,
have a baby.

399
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,156
We should look
into having a sign made.

400
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,375
<i>Kids, again, we were going
through a difficult time.</i>

401
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,693
But this part was kind of fun.

402
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:16,264
Aw...!
So cute!

403
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:18,099
This is awesome.

404
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:20,468
Right?

405
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,487
Robin, come out
and talk to us.

406
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,022
I'm not coming out
of this bathroom

407
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,641
until everyone stops
acting crazy!

408
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:28,660
No one is being crazy.

409
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,678
<i>Again, for the purposes
of this story...</i>

410
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:35,366
Ted and I have
a baby. Crazy!

411
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,951
What the hell is that?

412
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:40,255
Guys, this is Hurricane
Stinson-Mosby.

413
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:41,422
Mosby-Stinson.

414
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:43,758
You named your
baby Hurricane?

415
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
That is...

416
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:48,213
ultimately inconsiderate
to the child

417
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,098
who has to live
with that name.

418
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,851
Okay, how the hell
does Barney have a baby?

419
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:54,168
No idea. Super confused.

420
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,504
I'm finding it best
to just sort of go with it.

421
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:58,773
She's super cute,
though, right?

422
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:01,025
Wait a minute.

423
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:05,179
Oh, guh! Hurricane
dookied in her drawers.

424
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:08,566
Ha-ha!
Poopy pants!

425
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,184
She needs
a new diaper.

426
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:12,120
Right. Where do you
keep your diapers?

427
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:13,404
We don't have any.

428
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,822
You don't... Wow.

429
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:18,710
Okay. (scoffs) I guess
I'll go buy some.

430
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,246
You're gonna be a mom and
you don't have any diapers?

431
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:24,249
Lord, watch over
that child.

432
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,984
Uh, okay.

433
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,536
Come here, you.

434
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:32,390
So, there was talk
of a cheese plate?

435
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:42,016
Hey.

436
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:44,435
Cheese?

437
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,987
Thanks.

438
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,192
If you don't mind
me asking...

439
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:53,411
what-what is
this all about?

440
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:57,031
I mean, you are one of the most
strong, independent,

441
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,233
non-locking-themselves-in-

442
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,252
a-bathroom-on-Thanksgiving
people I know.

443
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,906
Why-why are you so upset
about us moving?

444
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:08,376
Maybe I just need you guys
more than you think.

445
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:12,830
Is this about more
than us moving?

446
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,099
This is good cheese.

447
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,169
Robin?

448
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,971
Yeah?

449
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,607
Do you think I should've become
a Ghostbuster?

450
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,692
I think you made
the right call, buddy.

451
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:29,447
Okay, Ted, I'm not gonna ask you
where Barney got this baby.

452
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,766
But do you have any idea why?

453
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:34,118
Well, a few nights ago,
we were talking...

454
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,322
you know, "We hate girls,
we wish we were gay,"

455
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,106
just guy stuff.

456
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:42,076
And we kind of
sort of decided to...

457
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:43,628
adopt a baby.

458
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,413
Yeah, that's crazy.

459
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:46,631
I know.

460
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,632
Is it, though?

461
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:48,666
Yes.

462
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,667
I know.

463
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,135
But is it, though?

464
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,136
Yes.

465
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,471
Well, so what if it's crazy?

466
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,623
I've been ready to meet someone
to start a family with

467
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,842
for a long time now,
and I keep not meeting her.

468
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,478
Barney is one of my best friends
in the world, we rarely fight,

469
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,647
and once we iron out
the whole pet cobra thing,

470
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,399
we will be amazing dads.

471
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:05,900
Why shouldn't we try this?

472
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,135
When's the last time
you fed her?

473
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:10,021
She had some root beer
on the train.

474
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,357
Oh, Ted.
And I'm sorry,

475
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,974
but you cannot call
a baby Hurricane.

476
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:15,610
Actually, her name is Sadie.

477
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,829
James, what are you doing here?

478
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,364
Did Barney
not tell you

479
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,999
that we were coming
for Thanksgiving?

480
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,316
Uh, no.

481
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,985
Then he probably also
did not tell you

482
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:26,871
that he was babysitting
our new daughter.

483
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,840
This is your daughter?

484
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,625
Oh, thank God.

485
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:32,427
And congratulations.

486
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,161
Thanks. Come here.

487
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:36,180
Aw...
Aw...

488
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,850
I guess this is good-bye,
Hurri... Sadie.

489
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:42,387
Your name is Hurricane.
Don't ever forget it.

490
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:45,356
Go with him. Go on.

491
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,557
Come here.
That a girl.

492
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,693
Hey, Ted,

493
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,778
I overheard
your little speech.

494
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,030
It's not crazy.

495
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,399
About ten years ago,

496
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:57,368
my best friend and I
nearly did the same thing.

497
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,655
She was single, I was single,
we both wanted a family.

498
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:02,740
It made sense.

499
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,292
But now?

500
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:07,745
Every day, we thank our lucky
stars that we didn't do it.

501
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,364
'Cause what she found
with her husband

502
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,250
and what I found
with mine--

503
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,552
it was worth the wait.

504
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,638
Hurricane's
a cool name.

505
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,475
Isn't it, Tom?

506
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:22,160
The pet store
was closer,

507
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,895
so I just got her
some wee-wee pads.

508
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,396
Oh, I also got this.

509
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,482
It's beef-flavored
and it's good for her teeth.

510
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,485
James! Tom! Hey!

511
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:31,886
Lily...

512
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,387
did you get
the e-mail

513
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,907
that I sent you
about inviting

514
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,359
James and Tom
to Thanksgiving?

515
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:41,395
I sent it to your CompuServe.
That's your main one, right?

516
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,081
Happy Thanksgiving, bro.

517
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,065
- Thanks. Hi.
- Hey!

518
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,919
Let's go sit down.

519
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,420
Hi.

520
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,507
All right,
you got me.

521
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:53,925
James is my baby guy.

522
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,295
But these past three hours--
magical, right?

523
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,847
We can do this!
Say we can do this.

524
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,549
We can't do this.

525
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:02,917
Sorry, dude.

526
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,520
We got to wait
for the real thing...

527
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:07,922
no matter how tough it gets.

528
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,675
It gets pretty tough.

529
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:14,528
I know it does, buddy.

530
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,398
I have some time
before dinner, right?

531
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,617
I'm going to go...
I'm gonna take a little walk.

532
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,452
All right. All right.

533
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:27,023
God.

534
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:34,965
- Hi.
- Hey.

535
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:44,341
Are we still friends?

536
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,309
Hope so.

537
00:20:47,723 --> 00:20:49,123
Good.

538
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,892
'Cause get this.

539
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:52,977
Ted almost adopted a baby.

540
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:55,473
Crazy, right?

541
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:56,857
Poor guy's going
through some stuff.

542
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,342
He actually tried
to rope me into it.

543
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:01,729
Can you imagine me
being someone's dad?

544
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,569
I'm pregnant.
