1
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:04,615
<i>Kids, Einstein was right.</i>

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:06,719
Time moves at different speeds.

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:09,505
<i>To Barney, the previous night
raced by in a blur.</i>

4
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:13,042
<i>But then, all of a sudden,</i>

5
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:15,661
<i>time stopped.</i>

6
00:00:15,663 --> 00:00:17,863
This might be the worst
thing I've ever done.

7
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:19,481
Hey, now,

8
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:22,217
you weren't at the top of your
game, but it was still pretty...

9
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,552
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:24,937
I just cheated
on Kevin.

11
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:26,856
He is the nicest guy ever.

12
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:28,858
I'm a terrible person.

13
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,025
It's okay.

14
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:31,327
We both cheated.

15
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,330
What's that saying about
two wrongs making a right?

16
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:35,998
"Two wrongs don't make a right"?

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,701
No, that's not it.

18
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:40,336
Oh, my God.

19
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:41,787
I just cheated on Nora.

20
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,572
How could I do this to her?
What are we gonna do?

21
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:44,456
I don't know.

22
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,958
Well...

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,961
Can I ask you, did
this mean anything?

24
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:50,429
Of course it did.

25
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,631
Of course it didn't.

26
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:55,250
Which one are you looking for?
I could see it going either way.

27
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:57,269
It meant nothing.
It meant nothing!

28
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:58,637
How could you say
it meant nothing?!

29
00:00:58,639 --> 00:00:59,972
Of course it meant something!

30
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:01,891
No, it didn't! It can't.

31
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:06,695
Okay? You're with Nora,
and I'm with Kevin and...

32
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:07,980
I have to go.

33
00:01:07,982 --> 00:01:09,281
Wait, what are
we gonna tell them?

34
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,282
Nothing.

35
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:12,484
God! We made a
horrible mistake.

36
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:13,936
But it-it is over now.

37
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:16,572
There's no reason to hurt more
people by talking about it.

38
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:19,909
You're asking me to lie?

39
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:22,244
That's... fine.

40
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:23,329
Damn it.

41
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,080
Nora and I have that work cruise
tomorrow night.

42
00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:26,382
We're all supposed
to go together.

43
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:30,252
Okay, I know this is thinking
way, way out of the box,

44
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:33,005
but what if-- and hear me out--

45
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:34,506
we don't go?

46
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:36,091
No.

47
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:38,961
I just want this whole night
to fade into history,

48
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:41,430
so we have to act like
it never happened.

49
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:42,631
We should go.

50
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:44,633
I mean, it's a three-hour
boat ride--

51
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:45,734
what could happen?

52
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:49,275
I'm sure that's what Gilligan.

53
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,092
Groovapalooza!

54
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,894
All the smug hippie bands from
the '90s in one big concert

55
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:12,988
Ah, even the tickets

56
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,606
smell like cloves
and mediocrity.

57
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:16,424
Ah, to really
take us back,

58
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:20,228
I scored us bag
of, yes, mari...

59
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,497
<i>Kids, we used to do something
before concerts</i>

60
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:23,832
<i>to enjoy them more.</i>

61
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,568
<i>And that thing was to...
eat a sandwich.</i>

62
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,253
...nated steak subs.

63
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:29,671
Oh, yeah!

64
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:34,009
Well, as future parents,
we'll pass on the sandwiches.

65
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:36,094
How could you even suggest
such a thing, Ted?!

66
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:38,179
I better
get my 60 bucks back.

67
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,598
No sandwich?

68
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,633
Marshall, it's a palooza.

69
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:43,685
We've eaten sandwiches
at every palooza.

70
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:45,637
Lollapalooza, Funkapalooza...

71
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,306
Gender-diversity-awareness-
palooza, junior year.

72
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:50,609
Yeah, there were
some real bitches there.

73
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:52,944
<i>Okay, quick,</i>

74
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:55,363
before Lily gets here,
let's fire this up.

75
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:58,099
No way. I promised Lily
that I would be responsible.

76
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:59,534
You're not getting
your 60 bucks back.

77
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:01,319
Give me that.

78
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,296
Hey, how you
holding up?

79
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:13,915
Well, I'm about to be
trapped on boat all night

80
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,501
with the guy I cheated on,
the guy I cheated with

81
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,953
and the girl that the guy
I cheated with cheated on.

82
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:20,255
So, not super.

83
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:21,456
Hi, Sandy.

84
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,674
You're welcome.

85
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:24,726
I did not say "Thank you."

86
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:26,627
Oh, you're too kind.

87
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:28,396
Too kind.

88
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:30,181
Excuse me, I
should really try

89
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:31,933
to have sex with
that new intern.

90
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:35,070
<i>Robin's boss, Sandy Rivers
hosted this cruise every year,</i>

91
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:37,439
<i>mostly to hit on
the new employees.</i>

92
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,859
<i>And he'd found a clever way
to never spend a cent.</i>

93
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:42,310
Up next, another four deaths

94
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:45,313
in Arizona's record-breaking
heat wave.

95
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:47,749
You want real
record-breaking heat?

96
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:52,587
Try Kristoff's JalapeÃ±o
Coconut Vodka martini.

97
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:56,291
<i>Muy caliente!</i>

98
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:57,625
Okay, Nora and Kevin

99
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:59,377
are gonna be here any minute.

100
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,463
I thought I could handle this,
but I can't.

101
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:02,881
Okay, um, here's the plan.

102
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:05,183
We'll grab one of the
lifeboats, get back to shore,

103
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:06,768
destroy the tape
of us doing it...

104
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,936
There's a tape of us doing it?

105
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:09,471
...and we'll start
a new life together.

106
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:12,774
Somewhere simple and homey,
like Vermont or Dubai.

107
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,809
Wait, is that what you want?

108
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,945
For us to be together?

109
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:18,012
Hey, Robin.

110
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:20,065
Oh, God, I really
can't do this.

111
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:22,400
Don't worry. Just follow my lead
and keep cool.

112
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:23,651
Hey, guys!

113
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,570
They know!

114
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:28,856
Oh, no.

115
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:33,461
I think that sandwich was
laced with other stuff.

116
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:34,963
Like, hard meats.

117
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:35,923
What do you mean?

118
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:39,985
Well, usually after a sandwich,
I feel paranoid. But I'm not.

119
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:42,804
Why am I not
feeling paranoid?!

120
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:44,806
What do you mean?
Calm down, dude!

121
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:46,641
We'll be fine.

122
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:48,843
Lily's gonna know.

123
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:51,212
Listen to me.

124
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:54,899
Whatever we were just
talking about...

125
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:56,851
we'll be fine.

126
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:58,853
You're right, she
won't find out.

127
00:04:58,855 --> 00:04:59,821
Hey, guy

128
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:02,157
She knows!

129
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,324
Good evening.

130
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:06,161
A special welcome
our four new interns:

131
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:08,580
Erika... and so on.

132
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:10,782
One safety matter:
life preservers are

133
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:13,034
on the side rails,
in case anyone falls overboard.

134
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:16,070
That's it.
Have a good night.

135
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:17,455
Don't drink too much.

136
00:05:17,457 --> 00:05:18,757
Or do.

137
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,077
Beautiful night,
huh, gang?

138
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,430
Yeah, Robin and I
were just cheating--

139
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,849
chatting about
how warm it is.

140
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:30,418
I'm breaking a
trust-- sweat

141
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,436
in here.

142
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:35,857
And I thought
we'd be cuckold.

143
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,942
I know why you're
so nervous, Barney.

144
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,427
You do?

145
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:41,813
You're meeting Nora's parents
tomorrow night, right?

146
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,699
That's it!
That's it!

147
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:45,533
Let's dance!

148
00:05:45,535 --> 00:05:47,285
Bah!
Whoo!

149
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:53,324
Lily has no idea I'm high.

150
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:54,742
You're high?

151
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:57,445
I'm sorry.

152
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:02,917
Lily has no idea I'm high.

153
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:04,669
Okay, well, if
your pregnant wife

154
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:07,005
has to sit here
sober all night,

155
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:09,891
she's gonna need
some of them nachos.

156
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:11,593
You got it.

157
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:13,094
Hey, dude, fork over
some of them nach...

158
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:14,262
No, not his.

159
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:15,796
My own.

160
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,565
Ah. Smart.

161
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,184
Come on, Ted.

162
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:20,518
What?

163
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,611
<i>And thus began the most
harrowing journey of our lives.</i>

164
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:32,664
<i>To this day,
Robin and Barney swear</i>

165
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,449
<i>this is the song
they danced to that night.</i>

166
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:39,003
âª You fooled around
on your baby âª

167
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:42,490
âª Now the least you could do
is to tell her the truth âª

168
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:44,125
âª Yes, you in the suit âª

169
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:47,045
âª Or that secret
will eat up your soul âª

170
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:50,598
âª Girl, the guilt's
gonna drive you crazy âª

171
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,383
<i>âª Crazy âª</i>

172
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:54,686
âª You can't live with this lie,

173
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,554
âª Gotta tell him tonight âª

174
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:58,673
âª Tell them right here
on this boat âª

175
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:02,977
âª You're like scum round
the edge of a toilet bowl âª

176
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,196
<i>âª Flush âª</i>

177

00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:11,402
âª You did these two wrong âª

180
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:12,904
âª Don't wt too long âª

181
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:14,489
âª In fact, you know what? âª

182
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:18,543
âª Tell them
right during this song âª

183
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:20,828
<i>âª Tell ', tell 'em,
tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em âª</i>

184
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,630
I'll wait.

185
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,916
<i>âª Tell 'em, tell 'em,
tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em âª</i>

186
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,136
Oh, come on, seriously,
you're not gonna tell them?

187
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:30,471
We have to tell them.
Right now.

188
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:33,141
âª Sure, act like
it was your idea. âª

189
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:34,375
Seriously, you guys suck.

190
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:41,990
<i>Marshall and I were still
in line to get Lily's nachos.</i>

191
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,781
Dude, we've been
waiting forever.

192
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:49,105
Even worse, this is the
line for the ladies room.

193
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,715
I can't believe that our
last Groovapalooza was,

194
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:56,433
what, 12 years ago?

195
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,385
I mean, time is
going by so fast.

196
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,587
I know, it's crazy.

197
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:03,056
In, like, an eye blink,

198
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:07,444
this hand will be, like,
an old man's hand.

199
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:11,398
I recognize the clichÃ©d nature
of what I'm about to say,

200
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,483
but... whoa!

201
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:14,651
Yeah.

202
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:17,321
312?

203
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:18,905
That's our gate.

204
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:22,075
Dude, we just walked around
the entire arena.

205
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:24,077
We've been walking
for, like, an hour

206
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,746
and we still haven't
found the nachos.

207
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:28,165
I bet Lily
is so upset.

208
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:31,802
Yo, you want
my nachos, bro?

209
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:33,887
Thank you.

210
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,307
My husband's been gone an hour
looking for these.

211
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,811
If he can't even do that,
how can I trust him as a father?

212
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,680
You can't, bro.
You can't.

213
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:46,900
I like your long goatee.

214
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,735
Marshall can't even
grow a beard.

215
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,354
Oh, that's sad.

216
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:53,657
'Cause one's ability to grow
facial hair directly correlates

217
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,393
with one's ability
to be a good father.

218
00:08:56,395 --> 00:09:00,530
I know it does.
I know it does.

219
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:06,336
Oh.

220
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,788
Excuse me, sir.

221
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,572
Do you know
where the nachos are?

222
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,178
Marshall!

223
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,080
Over here.
I found the nacho line.

224
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:19,216
Oh.

225
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:24,888
So, how'd it go with Kevin?

226
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,391
Well, I was just about
to tell him...

227
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:28,859
ok, Kevin...

228
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,361
Erika, I've been meaning
to speak with you all night.

229
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,762
Really?
What about

230
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:35,115
About me bending your hard
little body over the railing

231
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,267
of this boat
and copulating furiously

232
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,903
while I admire
the New York City skyline.

233
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:43,073
Or, if you're feeling dirty,
we can always face Jersey.

234
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:44,291
Thoughts?

235
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,994
JalapeÃ±o!

236
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:49,779
And just a hint of coconut.

237
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,168
Kevin hit his head,
he might have a concussion.

238
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,921
So obviously
I couldn't tell him.

239
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,172
What about you?

240
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:01,791
Something even worse
happened to her.

241
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:04,845
I got a tiny spot of wine
on my sleeve.

242
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:09,266
I couldn't pile on.

243
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:11,067
I'm not a monster.

244
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:13,236
Where are they?

245
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,489
Come on, forget
the nachos.

246
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,807
Everyone here
is having fun.

247
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:19,743
Look, even these guys.

248
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,411
Check it out.

249
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:25,565
Wow, music really does
bring people together.

250
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,751
Ted? Ted!

251
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,920
Creepy guitar guy
is following us.

252
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,045
We did a whole nother lap.

253
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:41,381
Oh, man, we missed like,
half the concert now.

254
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:42,465
Come on, let's just go
back to our seats.

255
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,690
Ted, Ted, Ted.

256
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,635
The nacho line
was right here all along.

257
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:50,440
So stupid.

258
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,310
As soon as we dock,
I'm taking Kevin to the E.R.

259
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:57,197
God, wish last night
never happened.

260
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,485
I don't.

261
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,904
What do you mean?

262
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:05,539
What if this whole thing,

263
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,075
it isn't the story of how we
both made a horrible mistake

264
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:10,961
and ruined our relationships,

265
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:16,199
what if it's actually the story
of how we got back together?

266
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:19,169
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
one last time.

267
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,471
Is this what you want?

268
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,139
It's what we both want!

269
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,059
Why else are we rushing
to tell them what we did?

270
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,645
On a boat!
That is a terrible idea!

271
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,381
Barney, we tried this
and we failed.

272
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:33,099
Why try again?

273
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,151
Because I haven't stopped
thinking about you

274
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,220
and you haven't stopped
thinking about me.

275
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,408
It's such a mess.

276
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,059
Why...

277
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:45,161
Why do you even like me?

278
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,833
I guess...

279
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,753
'cause you're almost
as messed up as I am.

280
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:00,043
Well, there's the small issue

281
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:02,012
that we're currently dating
other people.

282
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,130
How about this?

283
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:09,586
After we dock, let's each do
what we have to do,

284
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:13,940
and then meet up at MacLaren's
at midnight and...

285
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,192
talk about us.

286
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:23,316
Don't forget
your mystery gift bags!

287
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:25,235
They're condoms.

288
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,706
We just went all the way
around again!

289
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,907
Where the hell
are these nachos?!

290
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:32,542
Who cares
about nachos?

291
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,877
Oh, I love nachos, man!

292
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,295
You gotta relax, man.

293
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,331
You keep worrying about stuff
like nachos,

294
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,133
you're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

295
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,003
- I'm going back in.
- Fine!

296
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:46,089
Ha! Joke's on you!

297
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:49,559
The nacho line was right here
all along!

298
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,267
<i>Robin and Barney
were finally off the boat.</i>

299
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,019
<i>so they both assumed
it was going to be a lot easier</i>

300
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,321
<i>to admit
what they had done.</i>

301
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,073
Kevin...
Me first.

302
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,158
Look, I don't want
to make too much out

303
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,310
of saying "I love you"
for the first time.

304
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:08,978
Any way I can jump in
with my thing?

305
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,282
Robin... I love you.

306
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:15,151
Okay, Nora, lo...

307
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:16,653
Mom! Dad!

308
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:19,589
Hi, Nora, we
got in early!

309
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:23,927
Should've done it on the boat.

310
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:31,810
Ah!

311
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,280
Hey, where's your friend?

312
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:38,501
We missed almost the entire show
because he put his stupid quest

313
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:41,120
for nachos ahead of our
friendship, so I bolted.

314
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:44,090
Well, I'm just a creepy old
guitar player,

315
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:47,093
but isn't any time spent
with a friend a blessing?

316
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:49,795
And if nachos is all you seek...

317
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:52,048
take mine, brother.

318
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,300
Wow!

319
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:55,718
Thank you.

320
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,170
It's a sign, bro.

321
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,472
It is.

322
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:01,440
It's a sign
I should go find Marshall!

323
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,694
Marshall! Marshall!

324
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:11,617
So, Barney, Nora's told us
so much about you,

325
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:14,102
but we want to know everything.

326
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,927
Uh, let's see. Suit, laser tag.

327
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,707
I say "wait for it" a lot.
That's about it.

328
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:18,874
You two must be exhausted.

329
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:19,959
I'll make coffee.

330
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,696
I'm so glad to see how happy
you both are.

331
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:26,865
When you meet
the right person,

332
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,417
you know it.

333
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:30,202
You can't stop
thinking about them.

334
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,224
They're your best friend...

335
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:38,834
and your soul mate.

336
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,265
<i>You can't wait to spend the
rest of your life with them.</i>

337
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:47,036
No one and nothing else
can compare.

338
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:50,439
Now, where the hell
is that coffee, eh?

339
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:58,330
Look, Nora, there's something
I have to tell you.

340
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:06,739
Heart attack.

341
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,708
Oh, God, Ted was right.
I have to relax!

342
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,792
Ted!

343
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:11,377
- Marshall!
- Ted?

344
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,045
Ted!
Marshall!

345
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,413
Oh, Ted! Oh, Ted!

346
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,716
I'm so sorry! You were right.

347
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:19,135
No, Marshall, you...
Yeah, I was right.

348
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:20,386
But look, nachos!

349
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,006
Come on. Let's
go back inside.

350
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:27,426
That's it.

351
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,261
It's over.

352
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,697
We missed the whole show.

353
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,801
So...

354
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:38,404
yup, I love you.

355
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:41,040
Look, Kevin...

356
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:44,410
there's something
I have to tell you.

357
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:45,745
I cheated on you.

358
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:51,050
I don't even know
how to react.

359
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:53,118
I am so sorry.

360
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,289
I know I don't get
any second chances,

361
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,760
but you will always be...

362
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:03,062
Was this a one-time thing?

363
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:08,150
Can you tell me
it didn't mean anything?

364
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:12,071
No.

365
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,483
I'm sorry, Ted.

366
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:29,755
I still want to have fun,

367
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:31,490
There's just not
enough time, you know?

368
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:32,491
I know.

369
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:36,829
It's all going by
so damn fast.

370
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,181
Lily!

371
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:42,134
Hey! Oh, Lily,
I'm so sorry

372
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:44,637
that we ruined our night.
Yeah.

373
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,021
What are you guys talking about?

374
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:48,057
You've been gone less
than two minutes.

375
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,526
<i>Kids, she was right.</i>

376
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:55,781
My hand.

377
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:57,533
Whoa!

378
00:16:57,535 --> 00:16:59,017
Ah! concert!

379
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,703
Nachos! Ah!

380
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,707
Music!

381
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,030
- Time!
- Nachos!

382
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,034
Thank you!

383
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,754
It's a sign, bro.

384
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,339
Oh, oh...

385
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,202
Heart attack!
Marshall!

386
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:23,427
Marshall!

387
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,064
Time...

388
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:36,272
Lily!

389
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:38,607
Marshall, do you get
what this means?

390
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,192
Life isn't moving
too fast.

391
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,111
We-we still have time
for everything

392
00:17:42,113 --> 00:17:43,829
And we're not gonna miss
the concert!

393
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,732
I'm freaking out right now.

394
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:49,418
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah.

395
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,871
Do you guys know where
the ladies' room is?

396
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:54,206
- No idea.
- Haven't seen it.

397
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,378
Hey! How's it going?

398
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,131
Oh, not great.
Nora and I broke up.

399
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,216
Oh, my God, what happened?

400
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:07,219
I don't really feel like getting
into it, but...

401
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:09,087
I think the worst part is over.

402
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:14,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:15,978
- Hey, Kev.
- What's up, Kev?

404
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,279
How's it going, buddy?

405
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:18,530
Hey, guys.

406
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,733
There's something
I have to tell you.

407
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:21,934
Then don't.

408
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,485
What?

409
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:25,821
If there's one thing I've
learned as a therapist,

410
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:29,658
it's that just because something
needs to be told

411
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,077
doesn't always mean
it needs to be heard.

412
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,081
Kevin, I did something bad.

413
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,250
We've all done bad things.

414
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,219
Doesn't mean we're bad people.

415
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,554
Look, I don't care

416
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,340
about every detail
from your past,

417
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:46,508
and I hope you don't care
about mine either.

418
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,228
What I do care about is you,

419
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,132
and that from tonight forward,
you're in this as much as I am.

420
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,353
What do you think?

421
00:18:57,355 --> 00:19:01,156
I'm such a mess.

422
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,661
Why do you even like me?

423
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:06,812
Come here.

424
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:12,251
I am constantly amazed
by the things you say,

425
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:15,287
entranced by the things you do,

426
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:19,875
and unlike a certain JalapeÃ±o
Coconut Vodka martini,

427
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:22,160
you're easy on the eye

428
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,764
And if we're together
long enough,

429
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:30,019
I hope that one day you see
yourself the way I see you.

430
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:36,392
That's a pretty good answer.

431
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:38,978
<i>Sometimes hours
can feel like minutes</i>

432
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,815
<i>and sometimes a single second
can last a lifetime.</i>

433
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:47,569
<i>For Barney, the second that
would never end was this one.</i>

434
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,040
Well, um, I should go.

435
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,092
Tough night.

436
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:11,143
I'm so sorry.

437
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:13,178
Don't be. It's nothing.

438
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,850
It feels good to be sober again.

439
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:21,653
Man, how long have we been
sitting here, right?

440
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,739
12 seconds and you're
in the wrong booth.

441
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,364
I should go to bed.
