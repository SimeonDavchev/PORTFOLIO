1
00:00:01,555 --> 00:00:03,372
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2011,</i>

2
00:00:03,374 --> 00:00:05,424
<i>all of my friends
were in relationships.</i>

3
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:07,630
<i>So when Barney's brother James
came to visit,</i>

4
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,166
<i>it created
a slight logistical problem.</i>

5
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,120
We're gonna need a bigger booth.

6
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:15,972
I'm gonna go
to the loo.

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,173
I don't actually
have to go,

8
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:19,175
I just want a seat
all to myself.

9
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:24,814
So, would anyone care
to ask me where

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,516
Nora and I are
going tonight?

11
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:27,984
Don't ask him.
It's a trap.

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,487
- Where you going?
- Come on, man, for God's sake!

13
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,856
Bootytown, Kevin!

14
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,640
We are finally going
to Bootytown.

15
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:36,826
And that's why
we don't ask him.

16
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,863
I'm thinking I'm gonna hop on
the Long Thighland Expressway,

17
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:42,749
stop off for a nibble
in Breastport,

18
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,701
and then, with any luck,

19
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:48,137
I'll be pulling into
the Pork Authority by midnight.

20
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:50,507
<i>Wait. You're finally
going to Bootytown?</i>

21
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,258
Look, we just don't want
to rush anything, okay?

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,428
So we decided to wait
until she decides

23
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,130
to let me have sex
with her.

24
00:00:57,132 --> 00:00:59,165
And that's
gonna be tonight!

25
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,850
How do you
know for sure?

26
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,886
Ah, something
she said earlier.

27
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:05,522
Guess what, my sweet boy,

28
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,841
I've got a special treat
for you tonight.

29
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,512
Oh, yeah, you're going
to Bootytown.

30
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:14,781
Hello again, my darlings.

31
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,367
Barney, I hope you're ready
for tonight.

32
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,018
Because you're gonna have
to use muscles

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,236
you haven't used in years.

34
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:21,654
I am?

35
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:23,289
Yes.

36
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,375
And I hope you have
some aspirin at home,

37
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,377
because your arse is gonna be
killing you tomorrow.

38
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,912
It is?

39
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:29,746
Indeed.

40
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:30,797
Because tonight...

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,866
I'm strapping on this.

42
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,301
We're going skating!

43
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,253
The Pork Authority's
closed.

44
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:38,871
Looks like it's Hand
Central Station

45
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:40,039
for you, little buddy.

46
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,726
So that's your special treat?

47
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,094
Ice skating?

48
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:46,763
Of course.

49
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,715
And after that,
we're gonna shag.

50
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:51,100
We're going ice skating,
everybody!

51
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:08,352
Ask me what
I think of Nora.

52
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:09,821
What do you think of Nora?

53
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:10,988
Lovely girl.

54
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,907
Ask me what
I really think of her.

55
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:14,225
What do you really
think of her?

56
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:16,027
Guys, she's great, seriously.

57
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:17,662
Just drop it.

58
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:18,946
Ask me one more time.

59
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,448
What do you really think?

60
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,083
Fine! If you really must know,

61
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:24,168
I do not like Barney
with that woman!

62
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,087
Happy?

63
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:28,756
What could you possibly
not like about Nora?

64
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:30,842
Her hair?
Her mousy little nose?

65
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:33,094
The way she does
everything perfectly?

66
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:35,046
I mean, what's not to like?

67
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:38,800
It's not that I don't like her.
It's just...

68
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:40,268
She's our mom.

69
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,086
What do you mean,
she's your mom?

70
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:45,690
Everything about her
is vaguely our mom-like.

71
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:46,691
The British accent...

72
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:48,226
Hello again, my darlings.

73
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:50,111
<i>Mom's obsessed
with Julie Andrews,</i>

74
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:51,562
<i>so when we were growing up...</i>

75
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:54,315
Hello again, my darlings.

76
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:55,316
- Come here, you.
- Hey.

77
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:56,451
<i>And the way she hugs him.</i>

78
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:58,453
<i>Left hand on the nape
of the neck,</i>

79
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:00,655
<i>three gentle strokes on
the back with the right?</i>

80
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,206
Come here, you.

81
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,325
<i>Trademark Loretta Stinson.</i>

82
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:05,793
<i>But here's the clincher...</i>

83
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,078
Guess what, my sweet boy.

84
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,963
Guess what
my sweet boy.

85
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:11,782
I've got a special treat
for you tonight.

86
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:15,303
I've got a special
treat for you tonight.

87
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:16,504
Ice cream!

88
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:21,008
They're coming.
Be cool.

89
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,793
Forgot my raincoat.

90
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:24,979
That makes one of us.

91
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:28,483
Well, shall we?

92
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:29,901
We shall.

93
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:38,242
Ooh, don't wear out
that tongue, Barney.

94
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,078
Don't wait up.

95
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:46,334
I mean, sure, Barney has slept

96
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:49,003
with plenty
of other people's mothers.

97
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:52,089
But now he's gonna sleep
with ours?

98
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,458
Psychologically speaking,
it's perfectly normal

99
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,644
to wind up with someone
like your parents.

100
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:59,997
Thanks to my mom, I'll probably
wind up with someone

101
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,066
who loves my brother
more than me.

102
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,334
Well, psychologically
speaking,

103
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:04,752
I'm gonna go
throw up now.

104
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,854
Oh...

105
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:08,672
Ugh! This baby
is making it

106
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:10,858
so I can't button
my pants anymore.

107
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,977
Big whoop.
In 55 years,

108
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:15,363
I don't think my dad
buttoned his pants even once.

109
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:16,981
And somehow, despite
sweet talk like that,

110
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,317
I don't feel sexy anymore.

111
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,851
Are you kidding?

112
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:23,371
I mean, you're-you're
even sexier now

113
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,206
that you're rounding out.

114
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,793
I mean, you're even
more sexy simply

115
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:30,545
because there's so
much more of you.

116
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:33,798
I'm never gonna get
in the mood while

117
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,050
your mammoth Eriksen seed
is muffin-topping

118
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:38,586
the bodiddly out of me.

119
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,922
Are you saying,
"No erky-erky

120
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:42,557
until this baby
pops out"?

121
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,926
Okay, that's it.

122
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:47,511
I-I am making it my mission
to help you feel sexy again.

123
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:49,597
I don't care how much
more bloated you get.

124
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,182
I'll get the
next round!

125
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,100
Kevin!
Yay, Kevin, thank you!

126
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:54,551
So, Ted, you're cool

127
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:55,570
with Kevin, right?

128
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:57,488
I know he's been
over a lot lately.

129
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,557
Oh, yeah, yeah, Kevin's great.

130
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:04,495
I mean, there was, like,
one weird thing the other day...

131
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:10,484
He was just standing
there in his boxers?

132
00:05:10,486 --> 00:05:11,485
Yeah.

133
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:13,087
I'll talk to him.

134
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:15,923
Ted...

135
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:19,176
be honest.

136
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:20,845
You'd bang Lily, right?

137
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:23,381
<i>So, later that night,</i>

138
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:25,349
<i>Barney and Nora went skating.</i>

139
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,718
Hey, kid, you know
how your mom won't

140
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,937
let you have ice cream
till after dinner?

141
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,224
But then the waiting
kind of makes it taste better?

142
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:35,276
Well, I've been waiting
two months

143
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:37,728
for that bowl
of ice cream.

144
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,098
And tonight,
I'm gonna have sex with it.

145
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,072
Look, Barney,
one foot!

146
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:49,606
Oh!

147
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,575
<i>Now, kids, for most guys,</i>

148
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:54,795
<i>this would have meant
the end of the date.</i>

149
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:58,466
<i>But your Uncle Barney
is not most guys.</i>

150
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:00,451
I can turn this around.

151
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:08,118
Well, I'm impressed
that you know

152
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,252
a 24-hour dentist.

153
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:10,670
Oh, yeah.

154
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,255
He can also give you tattoos,

155
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:14,340
do your taxes
and alter a suit.

156
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:16,676
But I wouldn't trust him
with a suit 'cause...

157
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:21,180
Speaking of drinking,
you want to...?

158
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:22,432
No, Barney.

159
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:23,916
Tonight's been
a disaster.

160
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:26,185
I think we should just
call it a night.

161
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,887
No! Come on, Nora,

162
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,441
your tooth can't be that bad.
Let me see.

163
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,113
W-Which is the fake one again?

164
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,598
You look beautiful.

165
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Mmm.

166
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,737
All right, maybe I could go
for one more drink.

167
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,272
Great.

168
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,826
It's funny.

169
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:52,629
Sometimes the most
romantic moments

170
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,380
can just creep up on you...

171
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,142
I can turn this around.

172
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:07,760
Hey, um,

173
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:10,430
should've mentioned this before,
but, um, Ted and I prefer

174
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,131
that our guests remain
fully clothed in

175
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,467
the public areas
of the apartment.

176
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:15,801
Been some complaints.

177
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,770
Did Ted say something?

178
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,072
Oh, th-there's been
some complaints.

179
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:20,473
Not pointing any fingers
or anything,

180
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:22,942
but let's just keep
those pants on, okay? Good talk.

181
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,810
Well, if Ted said that,

182
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:28,314
I've got something to complain
Ted's nuts.

183
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:31,534
Okay, yes, Ted is a little
neurotic, but I wouldn't say...

184
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:34,871
<i>No, no, no, I mean Ted's nuts.</i>

185
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,874
Hi.

186
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:40,710
Hey.

187
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,691
So what? It's his apartment.

188
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:56,893
You're taking his side?

189
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:58,644
Wait, this isn't
one of those classic

190
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,346
"You still have feelings
for your ex-boyfriend,

191
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:01,948
"who's oddly also your roommate,

192
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,149
"which for the record
I'm totally cool with,

193
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:04,850
"even though everybody
tells me I've walked

194
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,452
into a bear trap" things, is it?

195
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:08,738
No, I just, I feel bad.

196
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,023
Ted's going through
some stuff right now.

197
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,410
You eyeballing his deal
is the most action

198
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,795
he's gotten in months.

199
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:18,081
I'll be nice to him.

200
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,417
So, I was trying
to think of how

201
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,387
to best express
how sexy you are to me.

202
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:26,005
A song? A poem?

203
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,841
a board game!

204
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,643
<i>You just get women.</i>

205
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,044
No, no, no, you'll like this.

206
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:35,565
We answer risqué questions
and perform spicy dares

207
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,267
to slowly move up
your shapely legs.

208
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,520
I call it Chutes and Lilies.

209
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:42,522
I would've guessed Monopo-Lily.

210
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,073
Yeah, that would've been better.

211
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,057
Okay, game play.

212
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,226
Roll the die to see
who goes first,

213
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:50,246
forfeit a turn on a pass--
intended for two-to-six players.

214
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:53,065
<i>As Marshall explained the many
rules of Chutes and Lilies,</i>

215
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,918
<i>Lily thought back
to what Kevin said in the bar.</i>

216
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,838
It's perfectly normal to wind up
with someone like your parents.

217
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,457
<i>And then she thought of
the only other man she knew</i>

218
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,326
<i>who loved board games
that much.</i>

219
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:05,011
I brought Diseases!

220
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:06,295
Marshgammon.

221
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,880
Dog Fight Promoter!

222
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,632
Lilial Pursuit.

223
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,438
And that's how you play
the game.

224
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,556
Oh, wait.

225
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:18,474
I forgot to tell you
what happens

226
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,643
if I land on "community chest."

227
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:21,944
Honk-honk.

228
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,432
I just want to go home,

229
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:28,601
take a long bath
and go to bed.

230
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:29,619
No!

231
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:31,937
I mean, come on.

232
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,624
My place is so much closer.

233
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,242
I'll-I'll draw you a bath,

234
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:39,778
pour you some champagne,
we can forget all about this.

235
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,082
All right,
that sounds good.

236
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:48,721
That bath was
wonderful.

237
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,089
- Thank you.
- Of course.

238
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,141
What do you say we go
out on the balcony,

239
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:53,176
get some fresh air?

240
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,144
Ooh, that sounds lovely.

241
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,232
What a beautiful view.

242
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:02,151
I couldn't agree more.

243
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,740
Good-bye, cruel world!

244
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:09,108
Oh, my God!

245
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,244
I can turn this around.

246
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:12,161
Shh.

247
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:14,080
Ooh!

248
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:16,999
Ooh! Date night.

249
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:20,369
You know what? I'll just,
just watch this in my room.

250
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,872
Already had dinner in there,
why not a movie?

251
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,957
You should join us.

252
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,226
Yeah, join us.

253
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:29,545
No! No, no, no, no, no.
Three's a crowd.

254
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,964
Besides, you guys wouldn't
want to watch this anyway.

255
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,049
Try us.

256
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:34,267
<i>Well, have you seen Die Hard?</i>

257
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,935
Um, yes.

258
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,336
Okay, the guy who played Argyle

259
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:40,806
produced this documentary
about coin collecting.

260
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:46,646
Now, I know my sexy
little lady can't resist

261
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:49,232
a bubble bath,
especially one

262
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,150
with rose petals.

263
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,786
Oh, thanks, baby.

264
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,642
How about a sensual backrub?

265
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,028
Mm.

266
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,297
- Oh.
- What's the matter, Lilypad?

267
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,082
You love my backrubs.

268
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:09,418
Ah. I-I do... very much.

269
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,871
Good, because I got you
a brand-

270
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,590
new...

271
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,175
loofah!

272
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,982
Oh, yeah!

273
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:25,484
Rubs... oh, yeah!

274
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,738
Trying to watch the coin
documentary over here.

275
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,391
Hey, Ted, ever figure out who
you're taking to that concert?

276
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:33,659
No.

277
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:35,244
- You want to go?
- Sure.

278
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:36,712
- Really?
- Awesome!

279
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:37,947
It's a date!

280
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,416
<i>Now, Kevin,
as a trained psychologist,</i>

281
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:43,052
<i>knew the appropriate way
to voice his displeasure.</i>

282
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:45,454
I think we need
to calmly discuss

283
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:48,124
the relationship dynamics
at play here.

284
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:50,626
I'm uncomfortable
with how close you two are

285
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:54,130
as roommates, given your
particular romantic history.

286
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:56,299
<i>Instead, he took
a different approach.</i>

287
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:58,083
Aw, hell no!

288
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,102
If you can go on a date
with my girlfriend,

289
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,438
I don't have to wear pants
in your apartment!

290
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,274
I can't wait till
this baby comes out

291
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:07,360
so we can get started
on another one.

292
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:09,145
Then again,

293
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:10,479
why wait?
Ew, wait...

294
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,930
Get off of me!

295
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:12,898
Damn it!

296
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,200
Ever since Kevin said

297
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:16,335
it's normal to wind up
with your parents,

298
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:19,071
I... I keep picturing yo
as my dad.

299
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:22,274
Lily, that theory is crazy-town.

300
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:23,209
How do you know?

301
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:25,411
Because my mother is
six-foot-three,

302
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:27,463
she buys her clothes
at the drugstore,

303
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:30,132
and she prefers
to trap her own dinner.

304
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,752
I love you more than anything,

305
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,253
and you're nothing like her.

306
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:36,339
Aw.

307
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:38,808
Now, that's how
you turn a girl on.

308
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,393
- Mm...
- Mm...

309
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:43,312
<i>But then Marshall
really started thinking</i>

310
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:45,064
<i>about Kevin's theory.</i>

311
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,567
Midnight snack.

312
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:50,353
Midnight snack.

313
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:51,404
Mmm.

314
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:54,190
Oh, yeah.

315
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:58,411
Oh, yeah...!

316
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,947
I am gonna rock...

317
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,366
your...

318
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,584
world.

319
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,623
Yay.

320
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,591
If it's any consolation,

321
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:16,962
<i>the, uh... the guy stole my
Wall Street Journal once.</i>

322
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:21,684
So... guess the world's kind
of a better place without...

323
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:25,504
Oh, God, this
night's ruined.

324
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:27,273
Oh, come here, you.

325
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,729
Yes, it's been
a very tough night,

326
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,782
but I still think
we can turn this around.

327
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:38,401
Really?

328
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:39,652
Why not?

329
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:42,121
No sense in letting things
get us down.

330
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,957

I want to thank you,
baby, for reminding me of

343
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:36,370
what a vivacious woman I am.

344
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:37,371
Yeah.

345
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,623
No, uh, no need really.

346
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,643
Whoa, but I've been
such a naughty girl.

347
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,396
Maybe I need a spanking.

348
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:48,098
Great. We'll...

349
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,035
we'll just skip
the board games

350
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:56,156
and get right down to me
making love to you.

351
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:58,325
Oh...

352
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,660
Okay, good, 'cause

353
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:05,165
I'm gonna ride you
like an unbroken stallion.

354
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,885
Okay.

355
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,554
Giddyup, cowgirl.

356
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,011
No, I can't go
through with this!

357
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:18,128
Thank God, me neither!

358
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,296
You're too much
like my dad.

359
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:20,764
<i>You're too much
like my dad.</i>

360
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,933
Your dad?!

361
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:25,969
Okay, dropping trou--
bad idea.

362
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,655
We're moving on from that.

363
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:29,323
This guy is a snake.

364
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,025
What?! No.

365
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:32,526
Ted? He's a nice guy.

366
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:34,328
A really, really nice guy.

367
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,580
You should be more like him.

368
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:38,299
Mom, right on schedule.

369
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,334
- What?
- Nothing.

370
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:41,835
I'm just saying,
you think he's so fragile,

371
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:43,754
and yet...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, fragile?

372
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:44,872
You think I'm fragile?

373
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:46,957
Yeah, fragile like a fox.

374
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,175
First, he tries

375
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:50,327
scaring me off
with his little peep show.

376
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:51,762
Then he crashes our movie.

377
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:55,182
Now, he's got tickets to
some super romantic concert.

378
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:56,684
It's Weird Al Yankovic.

379
00:15:56,686 --> 00:16:00,504
Okay. But still, who's the first
person he asked to go with him?

380
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:01,889
My girlfriend.

381
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:03,507
Oh, man. Okay.

382
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:06,009
You think I'm the first
person Ted asked?

383
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:09,780
Ted, am I the first person
you asked?

384
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:12,316
Marshall...!

385
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:13,817
You, me, Weird Al.

386
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:14,768
No thanks, Ted.

387
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,869
Barney...!

388
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,488
I got two tickets
to Weird Al Yan...

389
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:19,573
Barney?

390
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:21,458
Lily...!

391
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,128
Come on! You'll be
the hottest girl there!

392
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,080
Okay, you'll be
the only girl there.

393
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:28,582
Stuart...!

394
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:30,668
Claudia...!

395
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,885
Brad...!

396
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:34,054
Nat-alie...!

397
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:36,223
Trudy...!

398
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:38,175
Ranjit...!

399
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,711
Carl the bartender...!

400
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:43,397
Dude from my bodega...!

401
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,983
Steam cleaning coupon guy...!

402
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:48,085
Mom...!

403
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:49,737
Please? I'll fly you out.

404
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,739
I don't think so.

405
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:53,056
I'm sorry, sweet pea.

406
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:54,975
Is Clint there?

407
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:58,412
No.

408
00:16:59,214 --> 00:17:01,782
Wow. You really
are pretty fragile.

409
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:06,236
Look, I'm trying to explain
to you guys that I'm...

410
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:08,756
Well, how do you
expect me to feel?!

411
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:10,040
I mean, all I want

412
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:12,876
is for someone to go
to a Weird Al concert with me,

413
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:15,379
and I'm stuck going
with my roommate.

414
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:18,015
Yeah, I might have to
rain-check you there, buddy.

415
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:19,750
I'm not a Weird Al fan.

416
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:22,102
He's just a rip-off
of Peculiar Jacques.

417
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:28,092
Guess I'm going to
this concert alone.

418
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:29,860
I'll be that weird guy.

419
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,613
I mean, that
other weird guy.

420
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:34,815
You know, there is one guy
you didn't ask yet.

421
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:37,534
Someone who happens to be
the biggest Weird Al fan

422
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:39,319
in the whole world.

423
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:42,239
Kevin...?

424
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:43,907
Ted...!

425
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,943
Oh! Oh, you are gonna flip
when you see our tickets.

426
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:48,495
They're in the shape
of an accordion.

427
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:49,830
What?!

428
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,052
So, uh, you
like Weird Al?

429
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:56,587
Not in the slightest.

430
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:03,927
No, dude, I'm the biggest
Weird Al fan.

431
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,562
I know,
I'm agreeing with you.

432
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:09,016
Do you know that I gave him the
idea for "Like a Surgeon." Yeah.

433
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:11,602
Yeah. I wrote him a fan letter,
and then a few months later...

434
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:14,037
Bam!
Top of the charts!

435
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,989
You guys can eat it.

436
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:18,575
Just... eat it.

437
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:19,576
- Hey.
- Hey.

438
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,078
How'd it go with Nora?

439
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,362
Well, among other things,

440
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:24,665
I realized
Nora's a lot like my mom.

441
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,034
I'll bet that
ruined things, huh?

442
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:31,755
Come on. Barney Stinson
always turns it around.

443
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:33,323
- How?
- Simple.

444
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:37,561
I turned...
it... around.

445
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:40,163
Oh...
Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

446
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:43,684
So the mom thing wasn't
a total deal breaker, huh?

447
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:44,752
No!

448
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:46,937
Guys, my mom is
the best person I know.

449
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:51,358
If Nora's even the tiniest bit
like her, I'm a lucky guy.

450
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,528
Hey, you know what?

451
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,364
I'm a real lucky guy.

452
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:59,566
'Cause I married my dad.

453
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,068
Aw.

454
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,205
So, uh, you want
to go get luckier?

455
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:08,909
Bye, guys.

456
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:10,544
See ya.

457
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:13,964
So, what should
we do now?

458
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:15,499
"We" should do nothing.

459
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:18,836
You guys get out of here,
go watch your movie.

460
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:20,254
I'm fine. Really.

461
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:21,922
- You sure?
- Yeah.

462
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:23,974
Thanks, buddy.

463
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:29,980
Uh, hey... hey, Kevin.

464
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:31,932
I think I'm a clone now.

465
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:37,204
I'm sorry.

466
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:38,822
Were you just quoting Weird Al?

467
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:40,657
I was indeed.

468
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:43,076
I'm a huge Weird Al fan.

469
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,913
Well, then I need
to buy you a drink.

470
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:48,165
I'll have a glass of champagne,
sweet pea.

471
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,501
One glass of champa--

472
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:51,785
Sweet pea?

473
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:56,006
Sure. Meeting
a fellow Weird Al fan?

474
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:58,175
That's cause
for celebration.

475
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:02,796
Bottle of bubbly,
coming right up!

476
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:24,046
"Dear Mr. Yankovic,

477
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,222
"my name is Ted Mosby...

'Eat It' changed my life..."

480
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:31,393
Blah, blah, blah.

481
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:32,845
Uhp. Here we go.

482
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:36,381
"I have some ideas
for new songs you could do."

483
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:39,718
Why can't they just
leave me alone?!

484
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,571
"Wake Me Up Before You Pogo."

485
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:45,775
Spend a whole afternoon
on that one?

486
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,893
"Like a Surgeon."

487
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:56,368
♪ I finally made it
through med school ♪

488
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:01,207
♪ Somehow I made it through,
ooh... ♪

489
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,508
Vinny!

490
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,521
Start recording!
