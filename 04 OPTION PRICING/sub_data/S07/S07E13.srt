1
00:00:01,354 --> 00:00:03,934
<i>Kids, on New Year's Day 2012,</i>

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:05,936
<i>Uncle Marshall took a trip
to Minnesota</i>

3
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:07,921
<i>to see someone he truly missed.</i>

4
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,029
Hey, Pop.

5
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:17,247
I can't believe
it's been a year.

6
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:20,233
I think the most appropriate way

7
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:23,570
to honor your memory today...

8
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:24,872
is to get blasted

9
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:26,840
and watch the Vikings
make the Bears

10
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:27,958
their furry little bitches.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,960
- Go, Vikes!
- Shh.

12
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:31,679
Sorry for your loss.

13
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,181
Which is what
we'll be saying to the Bears

14
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:35,599
in about three hours,
right, Pop?

15
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:38,385
<i>Kids, tailgating
at the Vikings-Bears game</i>

16
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:41,388
<i>was a tradition
for Uncle Marshall and his dad.</i>

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,806
That's how
the government

18
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:45,425
covered up the UFO crash
in Roswell:

19
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:48,946
by canning the sliced up
alien carcasses

20
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:52,019
and calling it Spam.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,920
a.k.a Sliced Processed Alien Meat

22
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:57,154
Wow.

23
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,540
Is there anything
you don't know, Dad?

24
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:00,774
No.

25
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:02,609
I know most stuff.

26
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,995
And in your honor...

27
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:08,966
three decades of pork fat,
lighter fluid and Bengay.

28
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:12,669
Dear God, that's the stuff.

29
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:15,339
So much to catch you up on.

30
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,475
So, last night
was New Year's Eve.

31
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:20,460
That's a crazy story.

32
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:22,880
<i>So you haven't told your dad
that you're pregnant yet?</i>

33
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,465
No. But why should I?

34
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,300
My dad has never
been there for me.

35
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:29,970
This is just another chance
for him to let me down.

36
00:01:29,972 --> 00:01:32,906
Lily, you have to tell him.

37
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:35,993
He's at some board game
convention in Chicago.

38
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,579
He's your dad.

39
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,247
I don't see why people
aren't getting this.

40
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,532
Shoplifter
does not promote crime.

41
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,334
It celebrates it.

42
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:45,986
Excuse me.

43
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:47,320
Yeah.

44
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:48,872
Hey, Dad.

45
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:52,509
I'm, uh, calling with
some pretty big news.

46
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:54,344
I'm pregnant.

47
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:56,263
Great. Thanks.

48
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,263
<i>Anyway, Dad, Ted and Barney's, New Year's Eve</i>

49
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:16,516
<i>wasn't off
to a great start, either.</i>

50
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:18,051
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. It's 50 bucks,

51
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:19,251
and the line
starts out there.

52
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:21,253
Uh, we're regulars.
Oh, in that case,

53
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,106
the line starts out there,
and it's 50 bucks.

54
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:24,924
You got a problem
with that?

55
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:27,794
<i>Kids, here's why we didn't have
a problem with that.</i>

56
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:32,348
<i>And he was even scarier
without the toupee.</i>

57
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,866
No problem.
It's a little drafty.

58
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,651
We'll get you
a nice hot cocoa.

59
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,406
Check it out.

60
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:42,709
Sandy Rivers'
New Year's Eve show.

61
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,994
Thank God
I don't have to produce

62
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:46,162
this frozen pile
of poo.

63
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:47,413
How'd you dodge
that bullet?

64
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:50,633
Well, maybe Tina,
the producer, he, uh, picked,

65
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:52,251
is more talented
than I am...

66
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:55,088
at lying down while Sandy
does his business on her.

67
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,256
Does it bother you
that this pervert's

68
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:58,758
on the air,
and you're not anymore?

69
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,093
Do you miss it?

70
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:04,480
What? Why would...
why would I miss it?

71
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:06,649
No. I would rather

72
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:09,819
be warm and cozy
here in denial-- my apartment.

73
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,320
Robin,
I'm no therapist--

74
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:13,272
wait, yes, I am--

75
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:15,975
but I've got a New Year's
resolution for you.

76
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:17,309
Get back on camera.

77
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:20,663
Mine was going to be "make
a sex tape," so... two birds.

78
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,117
Hold that thought.

79
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,835
Hello?

80
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,153
Sandy?

81
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,504
Tina quit.

82
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:30,923
The woman I love just quit.

83
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:33,042
Love?
She's my everything, Robin.

84
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:36,629
My sun, my stars, my oxygen.

85
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,382
Plus, she likes it
fast and dirty,

86
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,517
and that's how Sandy rides.

87
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,436
I need you here ASAP.

88
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:44,887
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

89
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,305
Marcus?

90
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:47,690
What the heck
are you doing here?

91
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,642
What the heck are you
doing here?

92
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:52,945
I wanted to see Dad today 'in private'.

93
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:54,680
Well, I had the same idea,

94
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:57,784
and I drove all the way
from Mom's, so get lost.

95
00:03:57,786 --> 00:04:00,203
I flew here, so you get lost.

96
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,405
Um, I'm trying to have
a poignant moment

97
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:05,408
with our departed father,
turd face.

98
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,210
Well, I'm trying
to feel Dad's spirit

99
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,796
flow through my soul,
butt breath.

100
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:11,380
I'm reaching out to the beyond

101
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:14,200
to touch Dad's inner light,
ass clown.

102
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:17,470
I hear Dad's voice
like an ethereal song

103
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:20,807
guiding me toward salvation,
douche nozzle.

104
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,759
- Dibs on Dad.
- Dibs on Dad times infinity.

105
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,061
Oh!
Ooh.

106
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:26,979
I'll just pretend
like you're not here.

107
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:29,565
What?

108
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,584
Dad, do you hear something?

109
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:35,605
Perhaps the high-pitched whine
of someone who wet their bed

110
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,240
until they were 11!

111
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:38,441
Ten.

112
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:43,579
Anyway, Dad, since it's just
the two of us...

113
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:47,200
Lily and I
were going to spend New Year's

114
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:48,584
unpacking the baby room.

115
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:51,787
Um, sweetie, why
is this book in here?

116
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:53,506
<i>That's Enigmas of The Mystical.</i>

117
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:54,590
It's all about
mysterious

118
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:56,092
and unexplained phenomena.

119
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,878
Don't you remember the TV
commercials from the '80s?

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,130
<i>June 17th, 1983.</i>

121
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:02,798
<i>Tempe, Arizona.</i>

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,001
<i>A woman makes
a chicken salad sandwich.</i>

123
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:06,919
<i>Chicken salad sandwich.</i>

124
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,804
<i>Halfway across the country
in Michigan,</i>

125
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:10,523
<i>her daughter
is compelled to make</i>

126
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:13,425
<i>almost exactly
the same sandwich.</i>

127
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:14,810
<i>Tuna salad.</i>

128
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,412
<i>Coincidence?</i>

129
00:05:16,414 --> 00:05:19,065
<i>Or an enigma of the mystical!</i>

130
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:24,403
Yeah, those enigmas
always seemed a bit thin to me.

131
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:27,373
Thin?
Lily, this is 200 pages

132
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,943
of detailed accounts
about Bigfoot, ghosts,

133
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:33,329
aliens abducting people from
their beds and probing them.

134
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:35,047
I'm going to read it
to Baby Eriksen

135
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,282
at night-night.

136
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:38,251
You really want
to read our kid

137
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:39,802
bedtime stories about monsters?

138
00:05:39,804 --> 00:05:41,637
First of all,
I wouldn't use the "M" word.

139
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,889
Only they can call
themselves that.

140
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:44,290
And secondly,
are you really saying

141
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,392
you don't want to raise
our child as a believer?

142
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:48,344
I don't want
to brainwash our child

143
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,396
to believe in something
with no proof.

144
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:52,131
It's not about proof;
it's about faith.

145
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,400
Faith is what gives life
shape and meaning.

146
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:56,319
I mean, if there aren't yetis
or leprechauns,

147
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,404
what's the point of even
getting up in the morning?

148
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,689
I don't know.

149
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,408
Wife, unborn child,
drop a deuce?

150
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,611
Lily, don't you think
it's a bit narcissistic

151
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:08,948
not to allow for something
bigger than us out there?

152
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,367
Something whose
beauty and power

153
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:13,586
and majesty humbles us?

154
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:15,421
God?
Werewolves.

155
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:20,960
So, as the countdown
to 212 continues,

156
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,712
a quick warning, America:

157
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:25,715
Tina Henderson
is a soulless bitch

158
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:28,684
who will stomp on your heart.

159
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:31,103
I need you back, Tina.

160
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:33,022
I love you.

161
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:35,725
Well, if that's as bad
as it gets, we might be okay.

162
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,843
Bathroom break.

163
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:41,614
Oh, good.

164
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,816
It's on the Jumbotron.

165
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:45,284
Oh, finally.

166
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:46,518
Yeah, that'll be
100 bucks each.

167
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,371
What? You said 50.

168
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:50,539
That was before
the place got crowded.

169
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,690
Okay? It's
New Year's Eve.

170
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:52,992
People get rowdy
and break stuff.

171
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,160
The cover protects us.

172
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:56,629
Plus, you get these
festive hats.

173
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,697
For an additional
15 bucks.

174
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:00,583
They're wet.

175
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,168
Dry ones are 20.

176
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,719
That's it.

177
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:05,388
Don't bother,
everybody.

178
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,806
MacLaren's is a rip-off!

179
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:08,057
You'd all be better off

180
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,376
coming upstairs
to my place for a beer.

181
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:12,645
Hey, dude. You serious?

182
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:17,233
Ted, do you remember
a couple years ago,

183
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:20,552
we had the best idea
of all time?

184
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:21,904
We should buy a bar.

185
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:24,407
Of course! We could buy a bar!

186
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,192
The name of
our bar?

187
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:28,694
Puzzles.

188
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:31,063
People will be like,
"Why is it called Puzzles?"

189
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,582
That's the puzzle.

190
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:36,402
A bar where no
one's overcharged,

191
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:39,505
where everyone feels
valued and respected.

192
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:41,090
A bar...

193
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:44,093
where we get chicks drunk
and bang them.

194
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:46,045
We're opening
Puzzles tonight.

195
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:49,265
Of course we're opening
Puzzles tonight!

196
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:52,751
Aren't you going to ask us
why it's called Puzzles?

197
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:54,353
Nope.

198
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,222
Okay.

199
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:59,692
Okay, we're back
live in 30 seconds.

200
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:01,060
I don't know.

201
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:04,030
Uht's see if he's
still wearing his mic.

202
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:06,482
Taxi, take me to Tina's house.

203
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,150
50 West 67th.

204
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:09,702
Sir, this is a falafel stand,

205
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,120
and you're sitting
in the hummus

206
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:13,823
Okay.

207
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:16,292
Run the montage of people who
died this year until I get back.

208
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:17,493
And add Sandy,

209
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,712
because when I find him,
I'm going to kill him.

210
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:29,438
- Anyway, Dad...
- Stop hogging Dad already.

211
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:31,708
- I've got stuff to tell him, too.
- Like what?

212
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,810
You're still living with Mom,
and you have no job.

213
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:35,945
Go ahead.

214
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:37,981
So, anyway...

215
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:41,701
July 8, 19.

216
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:42,869
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

217
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:45,705
A hunter spots
a hairy form in the fore.

218
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:46,990
Bigfoot.

219
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,158
His story
is dismissed

220
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,710
because, to be honest,
he'd been drinking

221
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:53,279
and had a history
of mental problems.

222
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:54,881
But was it a hoax?

223
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,833
Or was it an enigma of the...

224
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:59,335
It was an idiot
in a gorilla suit.

225
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:01,287
Enigma.
Gorilla suit.

226
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:04,474
Enigma!
Gorilla suit!

227
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,125
Marshall? Marcus?

228
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,228
What are you guys doing he?

229
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,230
Having a private
moment with Dad.

230
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:13,316
No, I'm having
a private moment with Dad.

231
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:16,569
No, I'm having
a private moment with Dad.

232
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:18,154
Touchdown, Vikings!

233
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:19,972
Boom! Yeah!

234
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:27,464
Anyway, Dad,

235
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,417
since it's still
just the two of us,

236
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,985
I'll go on.

237
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,709
I've always envisioned Puzzles
as a literary salon,

238
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:41,845
where Gotham's intelligentsia
hold court

239
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,180
on art, philosophy
and literature.

240
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:45,682
Great.

241
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:48,718
And while you're distracting
the nerds and fatties,

242
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,003
I'll be in the VIP room
getting it in.

243
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:52,889
Uh, yeah, dude,
I don't know

244
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,558
where you got a velvet rope,
but you can't

245
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,694
use my room
for anonymous sex.

246
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,646
I'm kind of a neat freak
that way.

247
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,514
Hey, guys, I have an idea
for Puzzles.

248
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:07,871
What if... What?

249
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,789
Oh. Okay. I understand.

250
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,190
But he we like
your energy.

251
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:12,937
How would you like
to be our star bartender.

252
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,194
I've always wanted
to be a bartender.

253
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:16,496
It's just like
being a therapist.

254
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:18,143
You listen to people's problems,
pretend to care,

255
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:19,368
but you can drink openly,

256
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,801
instead of having to hide
your booze in a coffee mug.

257
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:23,136
Great. Oh,
check it out.

258
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:25,722
We worked out
a theme song for Puzzles.

259
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:27,223
While I was carrying
100-pound kegs

260
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:29,225

we in the middle
burying my aunt, so...

Oh I'm sorry.
We'll keep it down.

282
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:29,787
Oh.

283
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:32,121
It's just that I used to goto Vikes's

284
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:34,874
with my aunt;
may she rest in peace.

285
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,382
Anyway, so back
to my story.

286
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:46,636
She also loved burgers.

287
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:54,894
So now,
back to my story.

288
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,846
Aunt Laura sure loved
a toasted bun.

289
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,687
Tina, please tell me
Sandy's here.

290
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,940
Don't worry, he's here.

291
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:09,192
And we're back...
together!

292
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:11,527
He told me he loves me,
he's sorry,

293
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,696
and I'm the only girl for him.

294
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,166
You know, since we'll here,

295
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:19,369
and we're all horny...

296
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:23,489
I don't know
what went wrong.

297
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,241
Well, proposing the
three-way was bad,

298
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:26,676
starting without us
was worse,

299
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:29,245
finishing in the hallway was
the nail in the coffin.

300
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:30,597
No! Stop drinking!

301
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,882
I gotta get you
back on air!

302
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:34,500
But I'm single and
ready to mingle!

303
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:36,719
Hello, there.

304
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:40,473
Oh, the Twitter-verse
blowing up about

305
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,558
a new apartment-themed bar
called Puzzles.

306
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,860
Why is it called
Puzzles?

307
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,612
That's the puzzle!

308
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:48,314
Anyway, this VIP room
has a maximum occupancy

309
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:51,234
of two people including me,
so eeny...

310
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:54,120
and the rest
of you may go.

311
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:58,207
It's funny,
but it seems each time

312
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,327
<i>I read James Joyce's Ulysses,</i>

313
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,696
it's a different book,

314
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:06,833
begging the question:
Has the book changed...

315
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:09,252
or have I?

316
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,041
Okay, people are getting rowdy
and drunk and breaking things.

317
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,209
I know this goes against
the Puzzles mission statement

318
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:19,762
you made me memorize, but we
gotta raise our drink prices.

319
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:22,482
All right, just a little bit
so no one will notice.

320
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,521
Boo!

321
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,190
Poodles sucks!

322
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,693

All right, you know what,
you guys?

332
00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:12,906
No. No, no, no, no, no,
you said double

333
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:14,323
what MacLaren's
was paying me.

334
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:17,436
And why isn't anyone wearing
the hats I brought up?!

335
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,742
November 14th...

336
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:23,710
1982.

337
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:27,080
Everglades National Park,
Florida.

338
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,949
Five mysterious lights dance
in the night sky.

339
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:32,585
A ray shoots down,
lifting the park ranger,

340
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:36,172
who, to be fair, was going
through a bad divorce

341
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:40,426
and had a habit of lying
to get attention.

342
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:42,345
I hate this job, Sandy!

343
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:44,564
I went into journalism
to make a difference,

344
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:47,100
but you have made
that impossible.

345
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,018
You know, to be honest,
it hasn't been

346
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,987
an easy couple months for me.
I've made mistakes.

347
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:53,406
I've felt alone.
I had to let go of dreams

348
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:55,024
I didn't even know I had.

349
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:57,243
So here's the deal:

350
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:58,644
You're gonna get
back on air

351
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:00,279
and count us
into a better year,

352
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:04,867
because I just can't do
2011 anymore. You with me?

353
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:07,286
He's not with me, is he?

354
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,323
Anyway, Dad, where was I?

355
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,268
You know what?
Fine, get out of here!

356
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,520
We don't need ya!

357
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,325
And why doesn't anybody
like these hats?

358
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:29,329
I made these hats.

359
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:30,997
It's because
they' wet, Doug.

360
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,616
Why are they all wet?!

361
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:35,735
Were those our last customers?

362
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:37,754
Let me go check
the bathroom.

363
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:44,427
You must be
from the escort service.

364
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:51,634
The scenario is high school
wrestling match.

365
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,088
Hello?

366
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,691
So get this:
I lost Sandy Rivers.

367
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:00,693
Funny you should mention that.

368
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:01,761
It's almost midnight!

369
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:03,780
What am I gonna do,
go on the air myself?

370
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:06,950
Listen... Wait. Yeah, do that!

371
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:08,618
No, I-I can't actually.

372
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,454
Yes, you can. It's what you
really want and you deserve it.

373
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:13,456
Kevin, that's not how it works.

374
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,874
Sounds like that's
your only choice.

375
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,960
New York's a big city.

376
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:19,128
Sandy Rivers
could be anywhere.

377
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:23,316
And... wrestle!

378
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,469
Hey.

379
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:29,288
I'm sorry, baby.

380
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,974
I just...
I want our kid

381
00:16:30,976 --> 00:16:33,309
to believe that the
universe is magical.

382
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:35,345
You know, like
my dad taught me.

383
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:37,263
You know what
my dad taught me?

384
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:39,515
Nothing...
'cause he was never there.

385
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:45,772
June 22nd, 1996,
Brooklyn, New York.

386
00:16:45,774 --> 00:16:49,642
A man misses his daughter's
high school graduation.

387
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,861
Later, she discovers
her babysitting money

388
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:53,863
has been spent on
a board game called

389
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:56,866
Who Stole The
Babysitting Money?

390
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:58,952
He never saw
the irony in that.

391
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:02,455
December 31st, 2011.

392
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:06,459
A woman calls her father
to tell him she's pregnant.

393
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:09,545
says, 'Great. Thanks,'
and hangs up on her.

394
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:12,999
And after pushing
her to call him,

395
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:17,520
a Big Foot is discovered
in her husband's mouth.

396
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,840
I'm glad you're
a believer, baby,

397
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:25,561
but I'm never gonna believe
in an "enigma of the mystical"

398
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:28,731
unless I see it
with my own eyes.

399
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,650
Because the truth is,

400
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:35,154
my father never taught me
believe in anything but myself.

401
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:38,992
Well, if it helps at all,
I believe in you, too.

402
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:43,913
Then there's a pretty
good chance I don't exist.

403
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:45,164
How dare you?!

404
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,254
Oh, my God!

405
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:54,090
This is Robin Scherbatsky
filling in for Sandy Rivers.

406
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:55,975
You know, America,

407
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:59,312
tonight I've been groped,
stepped in puke

408
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:00,347
and until 10 minutes ago

409
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:04,400
had no idea I would be
on national television.

410
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:05,618
That's my girl.

411
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,906
But that's the magic
of New Year's.

412
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:09,831
When that clock
strikes midnight,

413
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,324
we all get a fresh start.

414
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:15,495
And I don't know about you,
but I could really use one.

415
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:19,365
And that magic moment
starts in ten...

416
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:21,067
nine...

417
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:24,387
<i>That night became a turning
point in Robin's career.</i>

418
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:29,292
<i>But we'll get to that.</i>

419
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:31,928
They're nice hats, Doug.

420
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,914
They're wet
but they're nice.

421
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,917
...three, two, one.

422
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:43,973
And that's the story
of New Year's Eve.

423
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:45,858
You know, I've been thinking

424
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,528
that the reason I got so intense
with Lily

425
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,031
<i>about Enigmas of the Mystical
is that, well...</i>

426
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,150
Could you pass the pickles?

427
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:58,821
...with you gone, I feel
the mystical a little less.

428
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:00,990
Can you hand me the chips?

429
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:03,826
Sometimes
I feel you a little less.

430
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:07,613
That's why today was
so important because I just...

431
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:08,781
I needed to...

432
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:15,805
Did you just open a beer
on my father's headstone?

433
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,306
Actually, it's a hard cider.

434
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:20,560
<i>And just as he was about
to lose it...</i>

435
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:22,345
Hey, Marvin, can you
pass me a burger?

436
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:23,763
Hey, not Marvin. Marshall.

437
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:26,132
Sorry, it's just,
you're so much like your pop.

438
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:28,735
<i>Your Uncle Marshall
