1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:02,783
Kids, have I ever told you

2
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:05,068
the story
of how I met your father?

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,369
Well, I'll just skip ahead

4
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:08,905
to the moment I told him
I was pregnant.

5
00:00:10,408 --> 00:00:12,659
W... What happened?

6
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:13,960
Did I pass out?

7
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:15,746
Not exactly.

8
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:17,881
I'm pregnant.

9
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:23,920
Are you sure you're not
just getting fat?

10
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:28,391
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:30,811
So, um, you're pregnant.

12
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:31,845
Yeah.

13
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:33,647
Huh.

14
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,016
Looks like nobody told
your boobs.

15
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:40,804
What happened?

16
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:42,105
Did I pass out?

17
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:42,856
Oh, my...

18
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:43,973
Please stop hitting me!

19
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:46,243
Hey.

20
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:50,530
Are... Are you sure you're...

21
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:52,449
Well, no, not positive.

22
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,867
I'm a week late.

23
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:56,086
But I'm never late;
it's a point of pride with me.

24
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:57,153
I'm going to go

25
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:59,339
see the doctor on Monday
to find out for sure.

26
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,542
Until then, not a word
of this to anyone.

27
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:03,760
Not even Kevin?

28
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:07,430
I mean, it's probably his.

29
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:09,299
I've spent years
training my boys

30
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:10,684
to swim the other way.

31
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:12,636
Kevin and I haven't had sex yet.

32
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:16,005
If I'm pregnant, you're the dad.

33
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,009
That's wonderful!

34
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,194
Huh?

35
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:23,146
I'm gonna be a daddy!

36
00:01:40,957 --> 00:01:43,384
Okay, one scotch for me,

37
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:45,068
one iced tea on the rocks glass
for Mommy.

38
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,019
Stop it.

39
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:47,020
Sorry, sorry.

40
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:48,071
Keeping it secret.

41
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:51,725
Oop, I think I gave you
the wrong one.

42
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:52,909
Here, let me just...

43
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:54,861
Give it to me.
Drop... let go.

44
00:01:54,863 --> 00:01:58,198
Take it away from you.

45
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,418
Barney, why are you
so happy about this?

46
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,419
Because this is perfect.

47
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:03,787
I want to be a dad.

48
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,422
This is not good news.

49
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:06,707
I have a boyfriend.

50
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,625
Yeah, but if Kevin
weren't around...

51
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:09,593
It doesn't matter!

52
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:11,795
I don't want kids.

53
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:13,013
I've never wanted kids,

54
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:16,850
and never, in a million years,
will I ever want kids.

55
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:19,519
Sorry, kids.

56
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,855
I can't have a baby.

57
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:22,939
Hey, guys!

58
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:26,526
Guess what this is!

59
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:28,762
One of your socks?
Boom! You're huge.

60
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:31,931
No, it's our unborn son's
Christmas stocking.

61
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,483
Grandma Gunderson
started knitting it

62
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,869
the day Lily and I got married.

63
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:39,873
She died before
she could finish.

64
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:40,907
I miss stockings.

65
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,876
My stepdad Clint
made us get rid of anything

66
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,612
that reminds him of the
commercialization of Christmas.

67
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:47,964
I thought you said he
dresses up as Santa.

68
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,667
Yeah, but, uh,
to protest gender stereotypes,

69
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,052
he plays Santa as a woman.

70
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:53,670
Though, he keeps the beard.

71
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:57,007
The result is disturbing.

72
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,308
Well, we should go.

73
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,260
We have to get
to We B Babies

74
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:02,512
so that we can register
for our shower.

75
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:03,797
No can do.

76
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,901
Um, I have a big project
that I'm working on.

77
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:11,855
This is Richard Holdman's house
in East Meadow.

78
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:15,108
Last year, he had the
most visited Christmas display

79
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,359
in the tri-state area.

80
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,245
But not this year.
You know why?

81
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:20,980
Because Big Fudge
has come to town,

82
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:22,999
and he brought his two friends:

83
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:25,485
Mannim... Steamroller.

84
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,486
Game on.

85
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:28,505
Are you okay?

86
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:29,656
Yeah.

87
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:31,925
Uh, it's just, um...

88
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:34,044
I hate Mannheim
Steamroller.

89
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,796
Isn't there anyone
else you can use?

90
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,949
Come on! Who am I gonna use
if not the Steamroller?!

91
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,967
I don't know. AC/DC?

92
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,819
AC/DC?

93
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,971
Robin, do you have any idea

94
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:47,607
why they call them
Mannheim Steamroller?

95
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:51,862
Because they rock... so hard,
so festively,

96
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:56,233
that steam comes out
of your brain.

97
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,951
As it melts.

98
00:03:57,953 --> 00:04:00,687
So I have to go to
We B Babies by myself?

99
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,522
Robin and I will
go with you.

100
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,210
Barney, what are
we doing here?

101
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,362
I want to show you
that having a kid

102
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:10,914
is nothing to be afraid of.

103
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:14,885
Kids. Stop.

104
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:19,222
Okay, first
on the registry:

105
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:20,257
nipple butter.

106
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,207
Uh-oh.

107
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,342
As you breast-feed,

108
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:24,210
your nipples stretch out,
like, four inches

109
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:25,762
and get all dry and cracked.

110
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,564
The nipple butter
stops the bleeding.

111
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,569
My four-inch nipples are
going to crack and bleed?!

112
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:36,356
Yes, but while the baby is
gnawing on your bleeding nips,

113
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:39,225
look what she'll be wearing.

114
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:46,566
Insane Duane?

115
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:50,003
Barney?

116
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:52,756
<i>Insane Duane was your father's
best friend,</i>

117
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:56,009
<i>back in the days before
he met me or your Uncle Ted.</i>

118
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,379
We're going back to her place.

119
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:00,380
Boom!

120
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:01,882
All right, you win!

121
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,250
Here's 20 for picking up a girl
with only one word.

122
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:06,252
And here's another 20
for that word being "boner."

123
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:07,888
Thank you.

124
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,592
I'll meet you back here in an
hour when I'm done with, uh...

125
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:15,028
Ah, who cares what her name is;
she won't be

126
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,112
around long enough
for it to matter.

127
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:18,481
Nice!

128
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:24,321
Shh...

129
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,156
I can't believe
I haven't seen you around.

130
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:29,075
Well, after Sheila and I
had that quickie,

131
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:33,713
my life's been playdates,
preschools and poops.

132
00:05:33,715 --> 00:05:35,632
I haven't set foot
in a bar in years.

133
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,300
You stopped drinking?

134
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:40,253
Oh, I still drink.

135
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:43,640
Vaginal
numbing spray.

136
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:45,225
Apparently, after child birth,

137
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:47,844
your hoo-ha looks like
Rocky Balboa's face.

138
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,897
- You can't have a baby!
- I can't have a baby!

139
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:54,467
<i>The next day,
we went to the doctor.</i>

140
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:55,819
Well, Mrs. Scherbatsky,

141
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,804
I'm sure that you
and your husband...

142
00:05:57,806 --> 00:05:59,239
Uh, he's not my husband.

143
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,190
Oh, I'm so sorry.

144
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,307
Your boyfriend then.

145
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:02,275
He's not my boyfriend.

146
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:03,443
<i>Oh, bozhe.</i>

147
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:05,445
All right, well,
I will just cut to the chase.

148
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:06,496
Wait! Wait.

149
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:09,148
All right.

150
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,583
Okay.

151
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:11,751
All right, we're ready. Good.

152
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:14,087
not pregnant.

153
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:15,655
Yeah!

154
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:17,040
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!

155
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,992
That's what I'm
talking about!

156
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:24,180
Yeah, you know,
you know!

157
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:26,666
Again, sorry kids.

158
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,502
Hey, mister.

159
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:31,554
Are you putting up
all these Christmas lights?

160
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:33,840
Oh, kid, by the time I'm done,

161
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,810
you're gonna be able to see this
son of a bitch from outer space.

162
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:38,728
Ah, cool.

163
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,814
I wanted to put lights
on our house,

164
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:44,067
but my dad says he's too busy
with work and stuff.

165
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,290
Hey, what do you say, uh,
you come back here next weekend

166
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,658
and help me out?

167
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,709
Yeah!

168
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,527
You've got yourself a deal.

169
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:55,862
I'm Scott.

170
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:59,198
I'm... Mr. Eriksen.

171
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,583
Thanks, Mr. E.

172
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,255
Mr. E.

173
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,557
Looks like some little scamp
just earned the right

174
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,592
to put the Vikings helmet
on baby Jesus.

175
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:14,647
<i>Later that week,
as I was enjoying every second</i>

176
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:16,149
<i>of not being pregnant...</i>

177
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:17,717
<i>Next on Teenage Mommies...</i>

178
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,986
But you said
you would watch Bella.

179
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:21,855
I have cheerleading practice.

180
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:25,091
Sucks to be you, Braces.

181
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,445
Oh. Um...

182
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,080
Yello!

183
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,534
Uh, yeah, I can come back in.

184
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:37,837
Robin, we ran some
tests last week.

185
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,042
This is going to be
difficult to hear.

186
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,845
<i>And then the doctor said a
bunch of medical stuff that...</i>

187
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:48,765
<i>well, the gist of it was this.</i>

188
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,934
I can't have a baby.

189
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:58,353
No. You can't have a baby.

190
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:02,159
Uh, great.

191
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:06,981
Uh, well, I mean,
um, not-not great.

192
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,065
I mean, I've never wanted kids,

193
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:10,184
so if it has to happen
to someone...

194
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:13,938
Robin, is there anyone
you can talk to about this?

195
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,573
Perhaps a close friend?

196
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,908
<i>I knew I could have
talked to my friends.</i>

197
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,743
<i>But, it's just, I already knew</i>

198
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:21,829
<i>exactly how
they would all react.</i>

199
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:24,865
<i>Ted would go into overdrive
trying to make me feel better.</i>

200
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:26,250
You need comfort food.

201
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:28,602
Fried chicken, mac and cheese,
mashed potatoes.

202
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:30,454
Open your present,
I'll work on these shoulders.

203
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:32,823
Okay, just breathe,
relax, eat your chicken.

204
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,542
Come on,
eat, breathe,

205
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:36,760
open it, breathe,
open it, eat.

206
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,328
Robin, why are you so tense?!

207
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,265
<i>Lily would just implode.</i>

208
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:45,502
And here I've been going
on and on about babies.

209
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:49,773
Oh, I am such a bad friend!

210
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,477
<i>And I'd wind up comforting her.</i>

211
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,445
It's okay.

212
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:57,347
You have to punch
me in the face!

213
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:59,650
<i>Marshall would ask me
a ton of questions</i>

214
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:01,201
<i>I don't know the answers to.</i>

215
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:03,354
- Have you thought about adoption?
- Um, well...

216
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:05,039
Does this kind of thing
run in your family?

217
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,873
Uh...

218
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,907
What was the date, duration

219
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:09,710
and consistency
of your last period?

220
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,329
<i>And your father would
bend over backwards</i>

221
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:13,797
<i>trying to make me laugh.</i>

222
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,199
A priest and a rabbi
walk into a bar--

223
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,552
no, a barbershop--
no, a post office--

224
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:21,088
no, it's two priests--
no, it's two ducks--

225
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,373
no, a priest holding a duck--
and he's Polish.

226
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,675
The priest, not the duck.

227
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:26,343
Actually, the duck
could be Polish, too.

228
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:27,561
Doesn't matter.

229
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,396
Yes it does.
The duck's not Polish.

230
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:30,481
<i>And when that didn't work,</i>

231
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,650
<i>he would actually
bend over backwards.</i>

232
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:34,285
Pratfall!

233
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:35,836
Ow!

234
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:39,222
<i>The bottom line is, I didn't
feel like talking about it.</i>

235
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:41,358
<i>So when Ted asked...</i>

236
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,277
Hey, Robin, you okay?
You look upset.

237
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,664
<i>I just came up with the first
lie that popped into my head.</i>

238
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,699
Yeah. Uh...

239
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:51,335
I just found out I can never...

240
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:54,955
be a pole-vaulter
for the Canadian Olympic team.

241
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:57,091
I'm too tall or something.

242
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,258
Robin, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Robin.

243
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,293
I had no idea.
That's terrible.

244
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,211
Can we get some fried chicken
over here, stat!

245
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:04,298
I am such a
bad friend!

246
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,216
Three slutty nuns
show up at St. Peter's--

247
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:07,518
Wait, wait, they're not slutty.

248
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,269
Well, they are, but you're not
supposed to know that yet.

249
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:10,420
Um...

250
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:11,755
Hey, baby, what's up?

251
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:14,091
Hey, uh, listen,
the construction of

252
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:15,726
the Symphony of Illumination
is taking

253
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:16,944
a little longer than I thought.

254
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:18,979
Good thing I have
Scott here to help me.

255
00:10:18,981 --> 00:10:20,114
Right, Scott?

256
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:21,782
You betcha, Mr. E!

257
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:22,616
Bad news.

258
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:23,651
Robin's too tall

259
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:25,435
to be an Olympic
pole-vaulter.

260
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:27,071
Has she filed an appeal
with the IOC?

261
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,539
Have you filed
an appeal with the IOC?

262
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,491
Can she make herself shorter
by slouching?

263
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:31,875
Can you make yourself
shorter by slouching?

264
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:33,160
Has she considered
going back to school

265
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:34,411
and competing at
the collegiate level?

266
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:36,296
Have you considered
going back to school and...

267
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:37,748
I don't want to talk about it.

268
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,667
Sorry.

269
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:41,502
I love you, baby.
See you tomorrow.

270
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:43,003
Okay, I love you, too.

271
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:46,974
Scott?

272
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:48,342
Scott, I dropped my phone.

273
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:49,810
Yep, found it.

274
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:51,095
Could you bring it up here?

275
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:52,396
You got it.

276
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,898
Hey, while I'm at it,
can I get you a beer?

277
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,318
He wants to bring
the old man a beer.

278
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,436
Yeah, sure.

279
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:01,188
Uh, there's a whole case
in the fridge.

280
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,356
Thanks, son.

281
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:05,242
Do you, do you mind
if I call you "son"?

282
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,361
You can call me
whatever you want...

283
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:09,163
jackass.

284
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,151
Scott?

285
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:15,619
The ladder fell.

286
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:18,822
Scott?

287
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:25,179
♪ ♪

288
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,005
Scott!

289
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:37,825
What are we doing?

290
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:42,179
Listen, um,

291
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:43,831
I know things have been
kind of weird

292
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,649
between you and me
these past couple weeks,

293
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,034
so I just want to say I'm...

294
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:48,619
I'm glad we're back
to where we started.

295
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:50,353
- Yeah.
- Friends with benefits.

296
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:51,655
- No.
- Just like always.

297
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:52,990
Never been that.
Just friends.

298
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:54,875
With benefits.
We'll talk about it later.

299
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,911
Look at all
these babies.

300
00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:59,913
Isn't it crazy how,
now that we're not having one,

301
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:01,381
babies are cute again?

302
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,751
Look at that one.

303
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:04,785
I'm good.

304
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,536
No, I'm serious.
Look, look.

305
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:08,138
Damn it.

306
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,340
That thing's cute as crap.

307
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:13,510
Screw you, baby.

308
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,014
Scott?

309
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:18,215
Scott!

310
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,234
What is going on?

311
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:21,935
Hey, Mr. E.
Scott...

312
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:24,688
if you do not let me down,
I am going to scream

313
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,573
my head off until someone
comes to help me,

314
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:29,910
and then you're going to have to
explain all of this to the cops.

315
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,561
And then you'll have to explain
why there's

316
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:34,031
a picture of my ding-dong
on your phone.

317
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,532
There is no picture of your...

318
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:37,918
There is now.

319
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Oh, yeah, that's a beauty.

320
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,121
Scott?

321
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:42,906
Scott!

322
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,759
Scott!

323
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:47,261
Marshall keeps

324
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:50,264
asking me to text him
pictures of my boobies.

325
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:52,049
After all these years,

326
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:54,935
he sometimes still acts
like a teenager.

327
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:56,436
I'll be right back.

328
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:04,528
Insane Duane.

329
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,698
It's Sane Duane now.

330
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,067
You used to be
magnificent.

331
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,244
Are you okay?

332
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:24,131
Yeah, yeah, um,
I guess this, um,

333
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:27,801
this pole-vaulting thing
is finally hitting me.

334
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:28,886
I don't get it, Robin.

335
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:31,588
Did you really want
to be a pole-vaulter?

336
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,292
No, no, I was,
uh, I was always

337
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,728
adamantly against having a...

338
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,013
uh, a pole-vaulting career,

339
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:42,132
even though it's
what most women want.

340
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:44,518
Most women want
to be a pole-vaulter?

341
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,687
In Canada--
it's very big up there.

342
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:48,355
You know, it's,
it's meet a nice guy,

343
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:51,158
get married, vault some poles,

344
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,593
but I...

345
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:55,162
never wanted that.

346
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:57,480
Of course, it's one thing
not to want something.

347
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:59,833
It's another to be told
you can't have it.

348
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:02,920
I guess it's,
it's just nice knowing

349
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:08,008
that you could someday do it
if you changed your mind.

350
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:13,380
But now, all of a sudden,
that door is closed.

351
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:19,119
What about the one where you ski
and shoot at the same time?

352
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,355
That seems like something
you'd be good at.

353
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:25,675
Oh, my God, Robin, look at this.

354
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:27,361
O Cana-dorable!

355
00:14:27,363 --> 00:14:28,362
Am I right?

356
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:29,897
Excuse me.

357
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:33,367
Yep, this works.

358
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,081
Scott, when I get

359
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:40,381
down from here, you are going

360
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,800
to be in big, big trouble,
mister.

361
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:44,168
Come on, Mr. E.

362
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,587
Didn't you ever cut loose
when you were a kid?

363
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:49,006
That's irrelevant.

364
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:51,425
I mean, of course I did.

365
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,644
One time, when my parents
were out of town,

366
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:57,732
my brothers and I set
the basement on fire

367
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:00,935
hosting
an amateur wrestling exhibition.

368
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,405
There were some theatrics.

369
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:06,774
See, you get me.

370
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:09,944
I don't think of you as some
dummy I trapped on the roof.

371
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:14,115
I think of you more like,
like my dad.

372
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:19,754
Can we keep the party going
for 30 more minutes, please?

373
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:24,375
Okay, Scott.

374
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:27,044
Thanks, Pop.

375
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:32,633
It's fine, kid just needed
to blow off some steam.

376
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:40,941
No!

377
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:44,111
Grandma Gunderson knitted that!

378
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:47,732
Scott...!

379
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:49,116
That was crazy.

380
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:51,452
She just ran
out of there crying.

381
00:15:51,454 --> 00:15:52,953
Now she's not
answering her phone.

382
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:55,906
She's been acting really weird
for a few weeks now,

383
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:59,910
really since the night
we discussed the hurricane.

384
00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:01,278
Barney, you split a cab home.

385
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,830
Did she say anything?

386
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:07,785
We didn't really talk much.

387
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:08,886
Well, lucky for us,

388
00:16:08,888 --> 00:16:11,806
someone at this table is skilled

389
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:14,558
in the art of detection.

390
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:16,977
Robin's upset.

391
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:19,814
She and Kevin
are having trouble.

392
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:21,632
- He cheated on her.
- No way.

393
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:25,319
Kevin's an honest, decent guy
who never on his best day

394
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:27,304
could pull a hotter chick
than Robin.

395
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:29,156
Maybe Robin cheated on him.

396
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:32,976
Maybe Robin is the dirty bird
who slept with someone else.

397
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:35,246
I don't know,
this pole-vaulting thing seems

398
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:37,147
like a slam dunk to me.

399
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,083
Oh, it is so obvious.

400
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,418
Barney.

401
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:42,503
What is the name of that guy

402
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:44,171
you worked with-- uh, Randy?

403
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:45,372
It was Randy.

404
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,340
Wait a second.

405
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:48,509
I just cracked this case.

406
00:16:49,762 --> 00:16:51,161
The little maple leaf onesie.

407
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:53,097
<i>It made her homesick.</i>

408
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,048
That's why she's so upset.

409
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,132
She's not going home
for Christmas.

410
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:57,635
She wants me
to invite her to Ohio.

411
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:59,503
That's got to be it!

412
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:01,555
Either that
or she slept with Barney.

413
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:17,288
Oh, you must be Scott.

414
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,707
Oh, hello, ma'am.

415
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,042
It's nice to finally
see your face.

416
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:24,545
Well, I'd better go
hit those books.

417
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:28,031
Hold it right there, young man.

418
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,635
This is for helping out
my husband.

419
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:35,139
Wow, 50 bucks.

420
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,307
Merry Christmas.

421
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:47,902
Lily!

422
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:50,104
An airplane ticket
to Cleveland?

423
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:52,106
I know it's not Canada,
but it starts with a "C"

424
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:54,525
and it's cold as balls,
so get packed.

425
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:56,243
You're coming home
with me for Christmas.

426
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:57,995
Yeah, nice try, dude.

427
00:17:57,997 --> 00:17:59,029
I wouldn't go to Cleveland

428
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:02,733
for $125 million
paid over six years.

429
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:03,751
Still?

430
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:05,336
Still with the LeBron jokes?

431
00:18:05,338 --> 00:18:06,587
Where's that ring, huh?

432
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:08,589
Where's that ring
he's supposed to have by now?

433
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,241
Look, I just-- I thought
you were bummed

434
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:12,793
about not going home
for Christmas.

435
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:13,911
Are you kidding?

436
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:16,263
I love New York at Christmas.

437
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:18,599
It's so quiet and peaceful.

438
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:22,102
Got my eggnog to keep
me company, so...

439
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,388
Robin, what's wrong?

440
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,440
- Nothing.
- Just tell me.

441
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:28,058
Why do you need
to know so bad?

442
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,226
So I can cheer you up.

443
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:30,761
It's not your job
to cheer me up.

444
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:31,729
Yes, it is.

445
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:33,814
Cheering you up is my job.

446
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,649
Well, then, you're fired.

447
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:36,650
You can't fire me.

448
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:37,935
I'm union, bitch.

449
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:39,403
It's not your job
to cheer me up.

450
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:40,454
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

451
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:41,372
Yes, it is.

452
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:42,940
No, it's not.

453
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:47,277
Merry Christmas, Ted.

454
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:50,331
Merry Christmas.

455
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:57,254
<i>So, kids, I settled in
for a Christmas alone.</i>

456
00:18:57,256 --> 00:19:00,057
<i>I appreciated that Ted wanted
to cheer me up,</i>

457
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,960
<i>but honestly,
it wasn't necessary.</i>

458
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:04,929
<i>So I can't have kids.</i>

459
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:06,680
<i>Big deal.</i>

460
00:19:06,682 --> 00:19:09,099
<i>This way there's no one
to hold me back in life,</i>

461
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:10,734
<i>no one to keep me
from traveling</i>

462
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:12,135
<i>where I want to travel,</i>

463
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,988
<i>no one getting
in the way of my career.</i>

464
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,807
<i>If you want to know
the truth of it,</i>

465
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:19,643
<i>I'm glad you guys aren't real.</i>

466
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,659
Really glad.

467
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,862
Damn it.

468
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:59,550
("Highway to Hell" by AC/DC
playing)

469
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:11,194
Yes, it is.

470
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:15,416
Look, you don't want to
tell me what's wrong, fine.

471
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:16,717
I don't need to know.

472
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:20,537
But you can never stop me
from trying to cheer you up.

473
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:22,589
It's a fact of life.

474
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:24,975
You're just gonna
have to deal with it.

475
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:26,043
Ted...

476
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,928
Hold on, hold on,
this is the best part.

477
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:33,884
♪ I'm on the highway to hell ♪

478
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:37,988
