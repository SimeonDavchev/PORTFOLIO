1
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:04,296
Hey, guys.
Where are Marshall and Lily?

2
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:06,214
Something terrible
happened.

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:08,016
Are they okay?
Are they in the hospital?

4
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:09,284
No.

5
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:13,321
Somewhere much... much worse.

6
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:14,556
Long Island!

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:16,057
Tonight, we're moving
out there for good.

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,611
Yeah. Here are your spare
keys to our new house.

9
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:21,012
Long Island?

10
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:22,397
I don't understand.

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,599
You can get spray tans here.

12
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,684
I never let myself

13
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:27,819
believe this day
would really come.

14
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:29,070
It's like when
they canceled

15
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:31,356
<i>Party of Five
for the second time.</i>

16
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:36,344
I mean when they...
canceled sports.

17
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:39,147
Guys, we'll still see
each other all the time,

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,648
and we'll talk
on the phone.

19
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,701
And I know people say
that having kids means

20
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:44,202
you won't see your
friends anymore, but...

21
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:45,754
Oh, God, this is
good-bye, isn't it?

22
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:47,122
No. Stop it.

23
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:48,373
Guys, this doesn't

24
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,624
change anything.

25
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,878
We are only a 46-minute
train ride away.

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,012
Just pop out

27
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:55,347
whenever you want.

28
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:58,216
So... I guess
this seat is open.

29
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:02,437
I'll go get a chair.

30
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:05,891
So that's it.

31
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:07,342
No more Marshall.

32
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:08,393
No more Lily.

33
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:10,011
They're gone.

34
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:12,013
Which means...

35
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:14,682
no lame married couple

36
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:17,402
shooting down
all my amazing ideas.

37
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:19,487
Guys, great news.

38
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:22,464
I'm the new leader
of the gang!

39
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,723
<i>Marshall and Lily were almost
done decorating their new home.</i>

40
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,425
I like it there much better.
Yeah.

41
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:41,542
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

42
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:43,094
Wrong!

43
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:45,546
This can't go here.

44
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:47,649
<i>Kids, when he found out
she was pregnant,</i>

45
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,217
<i>Lily's estranged father</i>

46
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,403
<i>unexpectedly showed up
on her doorstep.</i>

47
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:53,405
<i>It was a gesture
she appreciated.</i>

48
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:56,091
<i>But after two weeks,
they'd had just about enough.</i>

49
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:57,442
That has to go there

50
00:01:57,444 --> 00:01:59,327
to cover up
the splintery floorboard.

51
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,278
And you can't hang

52
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,696
this picture here.

53
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:04,165
This isn't plaster;
it's dried toothpaste.

54
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,936
Guys, you're so lucky I'm here.

55
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:09,621
I grew up in this house.

56
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:12,073
I know it like
the back of my hand.

57
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:14,793
And this lamp
absolutely cannot be here.

58
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:16,544
Why not?

59
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:18,680
Blocks my view
of the Widow Rodriguez

60
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:20,849
doing her Jane Fonda workouts.

61
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:22,767
Isn't she
a little old, Dad?

62
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,754
Oh, you didn't see her
when I was a kid.

63
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:28,957
In my mind, she'll always be 54.

64
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:34,779
I know he means well, but
I can't take it anymore.

65
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,597
He won't leave,
and-and he's acting

66
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,433
like this is his house.
No, I know.

67
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:40,952
And these annoying notes
he keeps leaving around?

68
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:43,655
"I need absolute silence
when practicing the drums."

69
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:46,607
"Do not touch the fudge
in my nightstand."

70
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:49,294
"We need ant traps
for my nightstand."

71
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,946
I find myself
hiding out here

72
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:53,915
just because it's the only room
in the house

73
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:55,083
where he can't boss us around.

74
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:56,301
Great news.

75
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:58,786
I put new batteries
in the old intercom system.

76
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,972
Now we can communicate
at all times.

77
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:03,141
Mickey out.

78
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:06,511
Look at what's become
of our booth.

79
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:08,847
Looks like my old
shop teacher's hand--

80
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:11,499
just sort of
missing something.

81
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,234
Enough!

82
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:15,653
I am sick of you two
wallowing in sadness,

83
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,272
instead of doing
the healthy thing

84
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:19,074
and pretending
anyone who leaves you

85
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:21,526
never existed
in the first place.

86
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:22,994
I hate to agree with Barney's

87
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,145
near-paralyzing
abandonment issues,

88
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:25,530
but he has a point.

89
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:26,698
You can't just stop living

90
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,483
because two of your friends
moved away.

91
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:29,868
Precisely.

92
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,705
Now, as new group leader,
I say we go out and do something

93
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:36,124
that we never would have done
with Marshall and Lily here.

94
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:37,542
Ooh.

95
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:42,380
Remember that amazing idea
I had that one time?

96
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:45,166
Let's go to a strip club.
Nope.

97
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:47,135
So what do you say?

98
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:49,837
Let's declare
our independence

99
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:53,441
with an on-da-peen dance.

100
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,895
On-the-peen dance.

101
00:03:56,897 --> 00:03:58,396
No, we got it.
We got it.

102
00:03:58,398 --> 00:03:59,680
Let's go to a strip club!

103
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:00,732
Well...

104
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,016
I'm going to miss
them anywhere.

105
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:04,152
Might as well see some
cans while I'm at it.

106
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:05,353
I'll take it!

107
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:07,122
Robin, Kevin, you in?

108
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,991
<i>Kids, early in any
relationship,</i>

109
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:12,694
<i>there's a phase where you don't
say no to anything.</i>

110
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:15,430
<i>Because you want
to seem interesting...</i>

111
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:17,799
<i>adventurous...</i>

112
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,551
<i>and open-minded.</i>

113
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:21,669
<i>I call it
Early Relationship Chicken.</i>

114
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:23,888
Well, I'm open
to anything.

115
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,341
Oh, mos' def.

116
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:28,209
So...
So...

117
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,562
<i>I don't want to go
to a strip club.</i>

118
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:32,097
<i>I don't want
to go to a strip club.</i>

119
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>But I don't want him
to think I'm some prude.</i>

120
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,435
<i>Man, we've been saying "so"
for a while.</i>

121
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:39,437
Yeah!
Yeah!

122
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:41,940
Yes!

123
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:44,659
Tonight is going
to be legen--

124
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,945
Wait, are we sure it's a
good idea to go to a strip club?

125
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:50,832
Shut up, Lily!
I'm in charge now-- dary!

126
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:54,169
I've got no
cell reception.

127
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,787
I wanted to call Ted.

128
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:56,871
This feels weird.

129
00:04:56,873 --> 00:04:58,573
The last time I lived
this far from him

130
00:04:58,575 --> 00:04:59,624
was my semester abroad.

131
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,626
You never did a semester abroad.

132
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,077
That's what I called it
when we lived

133
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,946
on opposite sides of campus.

134
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:06,965
Wrong!

135
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,817
Please tell me you're not
plugging that in there.

136
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:11,803
Yes, Mickey,
that's exactly what I'm doing.

137
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:13,421
All right, fine.
I won't say anything.

138
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,940
It's... just that
this was my room

139
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,258
when I growing up,

140
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,477
so I know it a little
better than you.

141
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:22,263
Lot of great memories here.

142
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:24,983
Mostly just discovering my body.

143
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,202
That's it.

144
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:28,536
Mickey, since you got here,

145
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,822
you've been nothing
but judgmental and pushy

146
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:33,575
and strangely obsessed
with your adolescent sex life.

147
00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:34,826
Tomorrow morning,

148
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,611
you're out of here.

149
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:38,779
Well, I-I've just been trying
to help you...

150
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:40,215
We don't need your help!

151
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,786
I...

152
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,472
Oh, it-it's okay, baby.

153
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:49,307
It had to be done.

154
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:57,265
Too bad the one person

155
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:59,133
who could stop you
from making mistakes like that

156
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,002
was told he has to move out
next month.

157
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:03,838
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!

158
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,974
Would either of you
like a dance?

159
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:11,112
I'm always ready to rock.

160
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:13,948
And I'm always ready to roll.

161
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,284
So...
So...

162
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:18,503
<i>I'm not ready to rock.</i>

163
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,672
<i>Rolling makes me dizzy.</i>

164
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,292
Hell, yeah!
Yeah!

165
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:27,345
I'm buying my man a lap dance,
'cause that's just how I do!

166
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:28,996
Party like a
rock star!

167
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:31,115
Party like a rock star...

168
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:32,717
Uh, hey, guys.

169
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:33,968
It's Ted.

170
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,670
Um... you're probably busy
with the move still.

171
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:36,938
Um...

172
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,891
Give me a call
if you want to gab.

173
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:42,227
Sorry about using
the word "gab."

174
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,562
Ted, stop pining
over Marshall and Lily.

175
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:46,481
Have some self-respect.

176
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:49,016
Now, put this fiver
in your mouth so...

177
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:51,018
that stripper with the lazy eye
can vacuum it up with...

178
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,237
Barney!
Wh-what?

179
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,621
I'm allowed to miss them, okay?

180
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:54,956
They're my two best friends.

181
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,457
I'm your two best friends!

182
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,626
And we're here tonight

183
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:01,195
to show you there's no need
to miss something

184
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:03,798
when you can replace it
with something better.

185
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,634
Gentlemen, say hello
to J-J-J-Jasmine!

186
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,847
Remember her?

187
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:22,850
<i>- So, a while back, we discovered-</i>

188
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,351
<i>Lily had a doppelganger</i>

189
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:27,888
<i>who was a Russian stripper.</i>

190
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,423
Look at her, Ted.

191
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:31,108
She's just like old,

192
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,192
less-good Lily,

193
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:33,527
but instead of
bossing us around,

194
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:34,778
she shows us her boobs.

195
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,346
No touching.

196
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,649
Okay, a little
bossing us around.

197
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:40,651
I call her Better Lily.

198
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:44,038
Hey, Better Lily, please
dance for my friend.

199
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,373
Barney, I don't
need a lap dance.

200
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,826
I need to talk
to my friends.

201
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:51,194
Who says you
can't do both?

202
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:52,880
Talk to her.
She's got ears.

203
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:55,031
Yes, she does have ears.

204
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,084
You want to touch my
girlfriend's boobs?

205
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:58,552
50 bucks.

206
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:02,222
Wait-- Better Lily
is dating this behemoth?

207
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:04,341
Sound like anyone
you know?

208
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:06,042
That's New Marshall.

209
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:09,446
This is our gang now.

210
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,060
Hey, guys, Ted again.

211
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:26,396
Starting to think
you forgot about me.

212
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:28,499
Or replaced me
with some cool neighbor.

213
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:29,950
What's his name?!

214
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:31,735
I'm totally kidding.

215
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:33,287
Anyway, uh...

216
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,255
just trying to remember
what your faces look like.

217
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:37,174
Ted, when they serve alcohol
at a strip club,

218
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:38,876
you're not allowed
to show your vagina.

219
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:42,096
100 bucks, and you
will see the world, my friend.

220
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:44,381
They're already
ignoring my calls?

221
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:45,933
Look, I'm realistic.

222
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:48,685
I knew I'd have to get used
to going to the dentist alone,

223
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:50,554
but I didn't think
they'd cut me out completely.

224
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:51,555
If they don't

225
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:53,640
need us, we don't need them.

226
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,442
Yes! Finally!

227
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:58,312
By the way, did you see
how she opened that bottle?

228
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:02,166
Whoa.

229
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:05,085
Lights out in the suburbs
is... is really dark.

230
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,436
Where's the fuse box?

231
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:07,738
I don't know.

232
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,574
I know where it is.

233
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:14,244
Maybe I could fix it for you,
if I wasn't so busy packing.

234
00:09:14,246 --> 00:09:15,612
You know what?

235
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:17,614
I bet the fuse box
is in the basement.

236
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:19,133
I'll just... I'll go
find it myself.

237
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:20,467
How hard can it be?

238
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:23,887
As hard as that desk
you just walked into?

239
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,092
Good burn, Mickey.

240
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:32,062
You deserve a little
nightstand fudge for that one.

241
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:33,463
<i>Where do I look?</i>

242
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:35,149
<i>I mean, I can't look
at her chest.</i>

243
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:36,517
<i>Damn it! I just did.</i>

244
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,318
<i>Maybe Robin didn't notice.</i>

245
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,137
<i>Man, he's really up
in those jugs.</i>

246
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,490
Shake it, baby!

247
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,308
A playa's gotta play!

248
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,777
<i>This is weird.</i>

249
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,079
<i>I'll just look her
in the eyes.</i>

250
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,833
<i>Is he falling in love
with this stripper?</i>

251
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,150
<i>Quick, do something cool.</i>

252
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:56,537
Make it rain, son!

253
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:57,838
Money ain't no thang!

254
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,758
<i>Damn it,
there was a 20 in there.</i>

255
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,500
Hello, Mr. Eriksen.

256
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:12,102
From the sound
of the wind chimes,

257
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:14,354
I hear you've made it
to the first floor.

258
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:16,440
Okay... you know what, Mickey?

259
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:20,143
You can save the creepy
game master routine.

260
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:23,063
It's only kind of
terrifying me.

261
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:25,532
Oh, but the game has just begun.

262
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:28,351
I call it "Try Not to Bang into
All the Furniture and Stuff

263
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:32,856
on Your Way to the Fuse Box
in the Basement, Marshall."

264
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:35,125
That's just a working title.

265
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,627
Hey!

266
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:39,580
Got a little boob glitter
on your eyebrow, Mac Daddy.

267
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:41,531
Straight pimpin'.

268
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,634
Barney, you got
a little bit, too.

269
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:45,886
Where?

270
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:48,555
Did I get it?

271
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:49,706
Yeah, you got it.

272
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,308
Who needs Marshall
and Lily?

273
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,227
We got a new gang,

274
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:55,812
and we're all going to
hang out together forever.

275
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:57,264
My shift is done.

276
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,432
Good-bye.

277
00:10:58,434 --> 00:11:00,050
Wait, stop!

278
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,552
Technically, this song's not
over, so we still own you.

279
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:04,655
Plus we're best friends!

280
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,440
Where to next?

281
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:07,941
We go to underground
poker game

282
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:10,277
in mostly-abandoned
insane asylum.

283
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,945
Yes!

284
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:14,031
This is gonna be awesome,

285
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,049
and when it is, I want
you all to remember

286
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,368
who led you there:
Barney Stinson,

287
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,254
new group leader.

288
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:32,015
Yay!

289
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:35,251
I'm winning all
your chippies!

290
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,272
Let's not drink
when we're...

291
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:39,273
I'm thirsty; it's good.

292
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:40,607
It's good.

293
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:43,477
Marshall, I just remembered

294
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:46,530
I saw a box of matches
in the drawer by the trash can.

295
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,732
Okay, thanks, baby.

296
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,874
Lily, I can't find them.

297
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:00,210
Looking for these?

298
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:03,964
Oh, right, you can't see me.

299
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:07,884
Um, well, I'm burning the
matches you so desperately need.

300
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,774
Aah, ooh, ow!

301
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,642
Ow.

302
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:16,677
Hah! Oh!

303
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:20,630
Mickey... guess who found
the basement stairs?

304
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:22,966
I'll be down
at that fuse box in no time,

305
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:25,301
and when I get there,

306
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,471
I'm sure that I'll figure out
how fuse boxes work,

307
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:29,806
so it'll be fine.

308
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:31,158
Hey, Marshall,

309
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,410
I know I've been
messing with you,

310
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,812
but seriously,
that second step, don't...

311
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,914
I don't want to hear it, Mickey.

312
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,920
Oh, my knee!

313
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:45,872
Ow!

314
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:49,092
And watch out for my drum set.

315
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:52,679
I win again!

316
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:53,930
I was bluffing.

317
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:55,816
I didn't even have enough cards.

318
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:00,503
Ted, please stop winning.

319
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:03,056
Hey, look, it's the
New York City skyline.

320
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:05,058
♪ We built Chip City

321
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,193
Uh, uh!

322
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:09,529
♪ We built Chip City
on all your dough ♪

323
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:11,898
♪ Built Chip City
Hit it!

324
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:19,843
You know Butterfly-knife.

325
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:22,878
I'd expect this
from Face Tattoo...

326
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,697
or Jagged Cheek Scar,

327
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:27,433
or Larry,

328
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:28,267
but not you.

329
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:30,168
Why don't I get nickname?

330
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,637
Because you have too
many things, Larry.

331
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,855
You get one thing!

332
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,847
See, that's why
you bring New Marshall.

333
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:50,856
We go to party in
slaughterhouse.

334
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:52,358
You come?

335
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:54,793
<i>Please, God, no.</i>

336
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:59,999
<i>Don't let me be in charge
of the gang anymore.</i>

337
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,418
<i>I can't believe Dr. Kevin
doesn't remember me</i>

338
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,887
<i>from our sessions
three years ago.</i>

339
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:06,005
<i>Is that the lunatic</i>

340
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:08,390
<i>that stabbed
all those prison guards?</i>

341
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:10,592
<i>We gotta hit that party!</i>

342
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:11,927
<i>I'll never find love.</i>

343
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,212
We got to hit that party!

344
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:16,482
Sweet.

345
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,351
Lily?

346
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:22,938
I think we made a mistake
moving out to the suburbs.

347
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,907
I miss our home.

348
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,860
I miss our booth
with our friends.

349
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,582
And I'm pretty sure I have
a drumstick...

350
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:36,235
somewhere bad.

351
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:38,570
Dad, why are you
acting like this?

352
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:40,739
Well, I was just
trying to be helpful,

353
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:43,125
but you guys want me out
by the Fourth of July.

354
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:44,176
Tomorrow.

355
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:47,012
You know what
a helpful father,

356
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:49,465
not to mention grandfather,
might do?

357
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:52,017
Get these lights back on.

358
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:59,058
Okay, Marshall, listen up.

359
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,143
I'm gonna get you
to that fuse box.

360
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:04,146
Can't you just come down here
and do it for me, please?

361
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:06,198
I don't know anything
about this house.

362
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,399
No, Marshall...

363
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:10,652
<i>you don't know anything
about your house.</i>

364
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:17,109
All right, we got a lot
of work to do.

365
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:19,828
Wait here,
we get you

366
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,114
on VPI list for party.

367
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:25,634
You give us, uh,
$200 per person.

368
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:26,835
Cover charge.

369
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:29,254
That's pretty steep
for a cover charge.

370
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:31,423
Is very good party.

371
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:36,328
Is party for, uh, New York
"Yunkees" and Coca-Cola.

372
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,679
Oh, my God.

373
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:39,681
A Coca-Cola Yankees party?

374
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:41,900
That sounds like a real thing.

375
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:47,172
Okay, now, Marshall,
take three steps forward,

376
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:50,275
while ducking underneath
the broken ceiling fan.

377
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:52,511
Now look to your left

378
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:54,530
and spit.

379
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,166
That's the water heater.

380
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:58,617
Want to stay away from that.

381
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:02,871
That baby is hotter than the
Widow Rodriguez in a unitard.

382
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:07,009
Okay, now past the washer and
dryer is the hardest part.

383
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:10,345
You're gonna have to belly-crawl
underneath the ping-pong table

384
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:12,264
and don't so much as nudge it.

385
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,348
Why not?

386
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,185
Because there are
900 dominos set up

387
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:18,020
in the shape of Barbara Eden.

388
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:20,639
<i>Big, big I Dream Of Jeannie fan.</i>

389
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:25,644
I'm clear.

390
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:33,735
I don't know what
that sound is, Mickey.

391
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:35,854
That's the sound of Barbara
Eden never banging me.

392
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:36,905
That's what that is.

393
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:38,824
Dad, get it back.

394
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:41,960
Come on.

395
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:44,546
Okay, Marshall,

396
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:46,248
take three steps forward,

397
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,667
and you should be
at the fuse box.

398
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,836
Do you think he made it?

399
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:56,058
I did it!

400
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,509
No, Marshall...

401
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:59,728
<i>you did it.</i>

402
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,183
Fun fact: <i>that night inspired</i>

403
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:06,351

408
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:21,200
Well, judging from
how many clients

409
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:23,068
that hooker has serviced,

410
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,670
I'd say we've been
here almost an hour.

411
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:26,788
Ted, we've been robbed.

412
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,908
Better Lily and New Marshall
would never rob us.

413
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,827
They're our best friends.

414
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,917
Damn it, Ted.

415
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:41,386
New Marshall is
an escaped zoo bear

416
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:44,690
and the only thing that Better
Lily is better at than our Lily

417
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,391
is over-the-pants hand stuff.

418
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:48,760
I'm assuming.

419
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:49,945
I'll admit it.

420
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:51,446
I can't lead this group.

421
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:53,232
We need Marshall and Lily.

422
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:55,100
But they're gone, aren't they?

423
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:57,569
I mean, it'll go from seeing
them a couple times a week,

424
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,371
to a couple times a month,

425
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:01,707
and then it'll just
be holiday parties.

426
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:04,576
Then the years pass,

427
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:06,245
and you find out
Marshall's dead,

428
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:08,797
and you're there for Lily
emotionally at first,

429
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,117
but then it becomes sexual,
and you feel guilty,

430
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:15,087
but maybe that guilt just makes
it dirtier and better...

431
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,454
No, I won't let that happen.

432
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:18,006
Especially that last part.

433
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:21,626
Look, I know I've been a little
drunk and naive tonight,

434
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:22,678
but here's what's gonna happen.

435
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,012
First, we're gonna leave a note

436
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:26,064
for Better Lily and Arvydas,
they're worriers.

437
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,516
Oh, buddy.
Then,

438
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:30,269
we're gonna go see Only Marshall
and One-Of-A-Kind Lily

439
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,636
because they're our best friends

440
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:32,971
and they're only
46 minutes away.

441
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:34,239
Are you with me?

442
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:36,525
Kind of resent the power grab,
but okay, let's go!

443
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:37,642
Hey,

444
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:39,494
do you want to come to
Long Island with us?

445
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:42,948
Uh, well, still a few more
hours before the sun comes up.

446
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,666
So...

447
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:46,251
No.
No?

448
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:47,152
Is that bad?

449
00:18:47,154 --> 00:18:49,871
No, it's great.

450
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:51,340
Ooh, that felt so good.

451
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:53,658
I hate doing things
and going anywhere!

452
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,926
Oh, new experiences suck!

453
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,347
While we're at it,
I hate high-fiving you!

454
00:18:58,349 --> 00:18:59,514
I know.

455
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:00,882
We're adults who are
sleeping together,

456
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,718
not teens pledging a frat.

457
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:10,892
<i>Oh, man, I really
liked the high-five.</i>

458
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:15,180
<i>The next morning, Marshall
and Lily woke up to a surprise.</i>

459
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:24,272
Hey, what are... what
are you guys doing here?

460
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:28,660
Just wanted to make
sure this key worked.

461
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:31,029
We missed you.

462
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:33,131
Give mama a hug.

463
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:36,201
Oh...

464
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:37,969
Don't check your voicemail.

465
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:39,755
Y-You might have
a couple weird ones.

466
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:41,390
You hear this?!

467
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:43,492
This is the sound
of me moving on.

468
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:52,601
Yeah, I'm a stripper.

469
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:55,637
Okay, who wants pancakes?

470
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,941
Which two of you want pancakes?

471
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:01,076
I'll make more.

472
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:02,110
Oh, good-good-good,
'cause I want pancakes.

473
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:03,195
There you go.

474
00:20:03,197 --> 00:20:04,446
Thank you, okay.

475
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:05,881
Enjoy them.

476
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,649
Hey, honey, look,

477
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:09,117
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.

478
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,503
Okay? I'll leave
right after breakfast.

479
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:13,171
I'll crash with some friends.

480
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:14,623
Dad, you know what?

481
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,907
You can stay.

482
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:16,758
Oh, thank God.

483
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,743
I got no friends.

484
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:20,595
I'll be here two weeks, tops.

485
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:23,632
<i>It wasn't two weeks.</i>

486
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:25,417
<i>Would the five
of us always live</i>

487
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,352
<i>within a few minutes
of that booth?</i>

488
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:31,345
<i>No, that's life, kids,
but here's what I discovered.</i>

489
00:20:32,423 --> 00:20:34,840
<i>Our booth was wherever
the five of us were together.</i>

490
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:43,361
That's right, Widow Rodriguez.

491
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:44,696
Stretch it.

492
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:46,347
Work those gams.

493
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:48,216
Ooh, yeah.

494
00:20:48,218 --> 00:20:49,901
Grab that left arm.

495
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:52,203
Clutch that chest.

496
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:54,749
Fall down really fast.

497
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:57,503
Oh, my God!
Somebody call 911!
