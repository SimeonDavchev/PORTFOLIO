1
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:02,786
Chester,
you're not even dressed.

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,721
- The reservation is in 15 minutes.
- Shh!

3
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:06,672
He's back.

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,141
Every night
at exactly 8:00 p.m.,

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,560
the well-dressed
blond man appears.

6
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:14,396
Chuck and Joanne

7
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:16,181
are going to be waiting.
You don't understand!

8
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,733
Every night, he does this.

9
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:20,352
Every single night.

10
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,488
He steps out of this building,

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,474
walks exactly seven paces,
stops,

12
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,110
and smiles.

13
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,874
Honey, I am worried about you.

14
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,542
Is he trying to communicate
with someone?

15
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,210
Is he trying
to communicate with me?

16
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,179
Why is he doing this?!

17
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,514
But aside from not being able

18
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:51,266
to fart in the apartment,
how's living with Quinn?

19
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:53,038
Oh, it's great.

20
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,882
Yep.

21
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:08,183
Living with Quinn is great.

22
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:11,620
Great, great,
great... great.

23
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:12,321
So how bad is it?

24
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,122
Pretty bad.

25
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:13,956
Last night,

26
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,691
I had just come back

27
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:16,858
from my 8:00 fart.

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,359
Sure.

29
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:18,293
Go on.

30
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,739
Still no mail.

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,110
I think they only deliver it
once a day.

32
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,499
Hey, listen,

33
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,801
when I moved in here,
I sold all my stuff

34
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:27,586
because I know you like
your place as is,

35
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,138
and I was totally fine
with that.

36
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,509
Would it be okay

37
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,592
if instead of using
your coffee mugs,

38
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:35,892
we use mine?

39
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:38,093
Hmm...

40
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:39,796
No.

41
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:42,999
Barney, she got rid
of all of her stuff for you.

42
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:45,046
Oh, I see what this
is really about.

43
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,438
Yeah, mugs.

44
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:48,542
Coffee?

45
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,109
Tea?

46
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:52,231
Eh, religion.

47
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,030
This is about the fact
that you don't think

48
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,232
this relationship
is gonna last.

49
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,752
That's why you don't want
to throw anything out.

50
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:02,121
Because when
that inevitable breakup comes,

51
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,072
you don't want to buy new mugs.

52
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:06,508
That's why I've never
thrown anything out

53
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,877
for any relationship ever.

54
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,580
Isn't that right, honey?

55
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,549
Oh, that's right. I'm alone.

56
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,718
Lily, here's the thing.

57
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,802
It's my apartment,

58
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:20,305
and I need to assert
my dominance as a man.

59
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,858
Don't ever say that...

60
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,728
to any girl ever.

61
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,813
Too late.

62
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,398
What did you just say to me?

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
- She gave up her apartment for you!
- You said that to her?!

64
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:32,651
Okay, you know what?

65
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,537
I don't have to sit here and
take this from you ladies.

66
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,105
I'm going to Ted's.

67
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:38,607
The man cave,

68
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,155
where guys can be guys.

69
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:42,250
- Assert your dominance?
- It's like you have no respect for women.

70
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,945
- What is wrong with you?
- You have a mother!

71
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:45,414
You guys, too?

72
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,916
I'm going to the Y for a shvitz.

73
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,718
No, dude, hold on.

74
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,136
You're not going anywhere.

75
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,055
It's trilogy time.

76
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,159
<i>- Kids, here's the deal-</i>

77
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:01,897
<i>It all started a long time ago
in a dorm room far, far away.</i>

78
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,182
Dude, if we fail
this econ final,

79
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,133
for the rest of our lives
we're not gonna be able to...

80
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:06,819
We won't know how to...

81
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,771
Do you even know what econ is?

82
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:10,405
No idea. We're screwed.

83
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:14,409
But there's only one thing
left to do at at time like this.

84
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,478
<i>Watch the entire Star Wars
trilogy all the way through</i>

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,413
because I haven't done that
in, like, five years.

86
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:19,782
Dude, you can't let that happen.

87
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:22,117
If you're not trilling it
at least once every three years,

88
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,819
the Dark Side wins.

89
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:25,204
Okay, let's make a pact.

90
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,155
No matter what,
every three years,

91
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:29,341
we sit down
and trill it up big time.

92
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,459
Agreed?

93
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,961
A-Greedo.

94
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,163
Wow.

95
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:37,216
2003, I mean...

96
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,218
What's that gonna be like?

97
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,607
Hey, Ted.

98
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:46,892
Sweet hair.

99
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,444
I told you it would
eventually stop growing out

100
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,179
and start growing down.

101
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,564
Anyway, I'm just working

102
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,183
on designing
yet another skyscraper.

103
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,368
And I'm carrying this briefcase

104
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,855
because now
I'm a successful lawyer...

105
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:00,823
I like that.

106
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,991
Can I make one adjustment?

107
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,627
With a cool mustache.

108
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:06,912
Nice.

109
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,247
And who knows, by then,

110
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,882
you and Lily might be engaged.

111
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:13,218
Engaged? Bro, I'm gonna do
way better than that.

112
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,723
Ah, being pregnant
is so much fun.

113
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,925
I want to do this
four more times.

114
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,210
Oh, baby, how do you feel

115
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:23,178
after spending all day
working on your art,

116
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,281
since I make enough to
support us both financially?

117
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:27,349
Horny.

118
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,217
I hope we don't
bother you, Ted,

119
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:31,353
because even though
we're married and pregnant,

120
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,721
it still makes sense

121
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:36,141
that we all share
adult-sized bunk beds.

122
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,395
<i>So, Star Wars?</i>

123
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:43,665
Sure, I don't have to be at work
until late afternoon-ish

124
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,284
because my boss appreciates that

125
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,337
I like to stay up late
drinking and...

126
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:50,906
rocking out with our band.

127
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,542
Did someone say rocking out?

128
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:00,048
Whoa, who's the babe?

129
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,050
That's the best part.

130
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,469
Guys, you remember
my awesome girlfriend

131
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,271
who was a virgin until we met?

132
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,222
Mm-hmm.

133
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,423
My name's Rhiannon,

134
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:09,892
like the Stevie Nicks song.

135
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,978
I'm hot, but in a crunchy,
earthy kind of way.

136
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,064
Oh, and I'm from England.

137
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:16,782
Nice.

138
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,483
<i>Okay, Star Wars time.</i>

139
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,653
But first, we jam.

140
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,438
Good thing I spent
the last three years

141
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
learning to wail on guitar.

142
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:31,546
Babe.

143
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:34,616
Yup, our band is
gonna be in demand.

144
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:37,469
And luckily,
there'll be plenty of supply.

145
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,088
Supply? Demand?

146
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,124
Dude, do you realize
what we just did?

147
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:44,793
We used econ.

148
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:47,346
We're gonna ace this final.

149
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,815
<i>We both got zeroes.</i>

150
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,299
Oh, dude,

151
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,686
2003 is gonna be awesome.

152
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,313
"Satisfaction"?

153
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:07,082
"Hot Cross Buns."

154
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,951
Well, keep it up, bro.

155
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,953
So, you ready to watch
the trilogy?

156
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,288
I don't know.

157
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,590
I mean, I really thought
that by now I'd be a lawyer

158
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:18,093
with a kick-ass mustache,

159
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,728
but I still haven't even
gotten into law school,

160
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,214
and my facial hair
just grows in patchy.

161
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,801
Just red and patchy.

162
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,970
Come on.
Your life's not that bad.

163
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,355
Dude, I manage a Structure.

164
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,507
But you get 10% off vests.
That's something.

165
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,476
- The vests are pretty sweet, but, look...
- Yeah.

166
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,644
Lily and I aren't married.

167
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,012
We don't have a baby
on the way.

168
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:39,281
But we did get
the cool apartment.

169
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:40,782
That we can barely afford.

170
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,901
I mean, I don't see
any way that our lives

171
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,653
are better now than they
were three years ago.

172
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,538
Oh, really, Marshall?
Nothing comes to mind?

173
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,356
By the way, guys, this is Lisa.

174
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:51,576
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Lisa.

175
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,414
And they never saw her again.

176
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,866
Whassaaaa!

177
00:06:57,868 --> 00:06:59,418
Okay,

178
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
three years ago,
we had this whole fantasy

179
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,171
about how great
our lives were gonna be,

180
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,423
and it didn't pan out.

181
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,591
But I'm telling you,
three years from now,

182
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,760
when we're watching
the trilogy in 2006,

183
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,229
our lives are gonna be awesome.

184
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,638
Ah, hello, Ted.

185
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,057
I'm an environmental lawyer now.

186
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:23,859
Sure, it's not
the most lucrative field,

187
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,161
but luckily I have
the cash and prizes

188
00:07:26,163 --> 00:07:28,363
from my historic seven-week run

189
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,949
<i>on Wheel of Fortune...</i>

190
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,085
Can I just make
one little adjustment?

191
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:36,922
For which I was knighted
by Her Majesty, the Queen.

192
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,257
Ah, Lady Aldrin.

193
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,176
Oh, Sir Marshall.

194
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:43,011
I cannot wait to get a house

195
00:07:43,013 --> 00:07:44,846
down the street
from your parents

196
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:48,550
so we can be close to your mom,
whom I get along with now.

197
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,885
Good, good.

198
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,303
But here's the best part.

199
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,221
Rhiannon, hurry!

200
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,190
Just because I designed
the opera house

201
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,943
doesn't mean they'll hold
the curtain for us.

202
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,361
Just kidding.

203
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:00,695
Of course it does.

204
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:02,814
Take your time, my love.

205
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,934
Hey, guys, it's me again.

206
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:07,619
I'm pretty much
the same as last time,

207
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,572
only now I'm super-rich
and fancy.

208
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:17,579
And it still makes sense
that we all live together.

209
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,999
What about you, Barney?

210
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,834
Any predictions for 2006?

211
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,836
Oh, yeah. Picture it.

212
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,122
By the way, guys, this is Jody.

213
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:30,008
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Jody.

214
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:33,962
And they never saw her again.

215
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:36,681
Whassaaaa!

216
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,068
How is that any different
from your life right now?

217
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,937
It's not. I'm KFC, baby.

218
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,972
You don't mess
with the Colonel's recipe.

219
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,525
I want things to stay
exactly the same,

220
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,143
but with a different hottie.

221
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:50,529
'Cause Barney don't slurp
no sloppy seconds,

222
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,615
especially his own.

223
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,250
Okay, the bottom line is

224
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:56,868
things are gonna get better.

225
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,204
Well, all I care about is
getting into law school.

226
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,655
You will.

227
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:03,408
2006 is gonna be awesome.

228
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,381
And look what happened.

229
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,049
You got into law school,

230
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,684
just like I said you would.

231
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,936
See, things aren't so bad.

232
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:16,337
Lily left me.

233
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,109
And now I'll never have
a mustache.

234
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:28,984
Baby, there you are.

235
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,654
I have spent all day thinking
about all the naughty,

236
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,646
naughty things
you and I are gonna do

237
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:34,680
to cheer up Marshall.

238
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,678
Like what?

239
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,012
Um...

240
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:40,194
Uh, I'll you guys
hang out, okay?

241
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,850
Um, I'll just be...

242
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:42,882
waiting in the bedroom.

243
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:45,571
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean that

244
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:48,640
to sound like Ted and I are
gonna do a kind of thing.

245
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,513
Okay, okay.

246
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:54,863
See you.

247
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,849
Marshall, this will pass.

248
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,647
Trust me.

249
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:59,731
Three years from now...

250
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:02,858
Briefcase, lawyer,

251
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:04,208
knighthood, mustache,

252
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,077
all that stuff from before.

253
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,712
Congratulations, bro.

254
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:09,547
And congratulations
to you too, Ted,

255
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,332
for locking this down.

256
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:13,751
You know, it's weird,

257
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,386
I never thought I
would get married,

258
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:16,637
but you talked me into it.

259
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,806
Or rather, banged me into it.

260
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,591
You're so good in bed, ooh.

261
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:24,312
How is this helping me?

262
00:10:24,314 --> 00:10:25,479
I'm getting to it.

263
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:29,567
In three years, not only
will Lily be back, but...

264
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:33,387
It's so nice to be married
to a wonderful guy

265
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:36,324
and be carrying his child.

266
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:38,576
I think you're being
kind of optimistic, Ted.

267
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:41,162
Can I make
one little adjustment?

268
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:45,182
It's so nice to be married
to a wonderful guy

269
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:46,834
and carrying his child,

270
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,953
and here he is now.

271
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:51,088
Guys, I want you to meet

272
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,040
some douchey guy named Trey.

273
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,293
- 'Sup, bro?
- Mmm.

274
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:57,077
I don't know what I love more:

275
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,846
His thick mustache

276
00:10:58,848 --> 00:10:59,931
or his trucker hat.

277
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,966
You know I hate those hats.

278
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:04,635
Then you're really gonna
hate this sonogram.

279
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,225
Nooo...

280
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:14,428
ooo...!

281
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:19,150
A baby in a trucker hat.
That's awesome.

282
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:20,217
Anyway, Ted's right.

283
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:22,703
2009's gonna rule.

284
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:24,705
By the way, guys, this is Maya.

285
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:27,873
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Maya.

286
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:31,464
And they never saw her again.

287
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:32,935
Whassaaaa!

288
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:34,102
Okay, seriously,

289
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,359
at least tell me you're gonna

290
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,784
change the what will by then be

291
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:38,534
nine-year-old beer
commercial reference.

292
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:39,488
I mean, come on.

293
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:40,707
There's got to be
at least one way

294
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,292
that you'd like the future
to be different.

295
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,705
I guess there is one thing.

296
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:46,794
By the way, guys, this is Maya.

297
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,930
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Maya.

298
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:51,065
And not because of these these.

299
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:54,218
<i>Because of these.</i>

300
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:57,188
Back boobs--
the visual stimulation

301
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,273
of missionary meets
the emotional detachment

302
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:00,608
of doggy-style.

303
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,909
Patent pending.

304
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:03,277
Whassaaaa!

305
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,312
The point is, Marshall,

306
00:12:05,314 --> 00:12:09,216
this time in three years,
everything is gonna be great.

307
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,506
See? Lily came back.

308
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:18,626
Of course, Robin and I
didn't end up together.

309
00:12:18,628 --> 00:12:20,711
But I did get engaged.

310
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:22,513
And left at the altar.

311
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:24,548
But I did start
my own architectural firm.

312
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,300
And it failed
after a few months.

313
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:28,302
- Can we put the movie on, please?
- Yeah.

314
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:29,136
Sure, buddy.

315
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:30,671
Hey, by the way,
where is Robin?

316
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:32,523
<i>In the summer of 2009,</i>

317
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:34,625
<i>Barney and Robin
were secretly dating.</i>

318
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:37,144
Oh, uh, Barney said she's
taking some extension class

319
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:38,863
in how to decoupage,
and Barney's taking

320
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,848
a different decoupage class
in the same building.

321
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,117
That's why they shared
that cab that one time.

322
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:46,454
<i>We were idiots.</i>

323
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:48,355
Wait a minute.

324
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:52,943
You're saying that Barney Stinson
is at a decoupage class?

325
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:56,163
<i>That means we can watch
Star Wars on his giant TV!</i>

326
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:57,999
Punch it, Chewy!

327
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,422
Oh.

328
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:05,539
You're back from decoupage.

329
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,891
What's decoupage?

330
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:09,593
Oh, uh, yeah, I took that
cab there that one time.

331
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:11,095
Hold on.

332
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:15,215
Come on in.

333
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:18,719
We were hoping we could
watch the trilogy here.

334
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:21,655
Uh, sure. But, uh...

335
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:23,891
first go look out
my, uh, bedroom window.

336
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:25,860
There's a, uh...

337
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:28,662
naked lady, uh...

338
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:31,231
jumping up and down
on a mini-trampoline

339
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:33,951
in the apartment
across the, uh...

340
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:35,419
street.

341
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,843
Get me out of this thing!

342
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:44,128
There's no time!

343
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,464
Barney, I am not ready for them
to find out about us.

344
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:48,582
Then you're gonna have to stay
in there for the entire trilogy.

345
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:50,851
Don't worry. It's
only 382 minutes.

346
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:52,186
Nerd!

347
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:57,308
So, where do you guys think
we'll be in three years?

348
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,093
It'll be 2012.

349
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:00,978
That's an easy one.

350
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,213
Guys, this is Sophia.

351
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,265
You'll be seeing a lot more of...

352
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:08,018
Okay, that is so weird.

353
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,338
I was just trying
to use the force.

354
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,791
Do you think instead
of making a beer

355
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:16,794
fly out of the fridge,
I made that lamp break?

356
00:14:16,796 --> 00:14:18,963
Either that
or the stormtrooper did it.

357
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,833
Oh, the stormtrooper
would never do that.

358
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:26,353
He knows that lamp costs $1,200.

359
00:14:27,255 --> 00:14:28,789
Anyway, while it's just us guys,

360
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,976
We've all had that same fantasy

361
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:36,063
about having sex with a girl in
a stormtrooper costume, right?

362
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:38,732
- Mmm, no.
- Never.

363
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:40,184
Guys...

364
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:42,736
come on, no girls around,
just us bros.

365
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:43,988
Safe space.

366
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,640
Let's stop being polite
and start gettin' real.

367
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:48,659
Stormtrooper fantasy.

368
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,444
Every guy's had that one, right?

369
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:53,080
Not even once, no.
No, no, no.

370
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:55,833
So I'm the weird one?

371
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,484
Yeah.
Yeah.

372
00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:58,786
Yeah.

373
00:14:58,788 --> 00:14:59,870
How about you, Ted?

374
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:02,823
How's your life gonna
be different in three years?

375
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,842
Oh, you know, the usual.

376
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:07,094
Gonna meet a nice girl
and get married.

377
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:09,630
I mean, I know I say that
every year, but...

378
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:12,466
let's be honest,
in 2012, I'll be 34.

379
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:14,301
If it still hasn't
happened for me by then,

380
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:18,389
something is seriously
wrong with me!

381
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:31,969
Something is seriously wrong
with me.

382
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:38,445
I can't do this anymore.

383
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:39,796
I can't keep smiling

384
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:41,531
and being optimistic
all the time

385
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,866
when all the evidence
points to the contrary.

386
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,176
You really think
that three years from now

387
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:47,658
things aren't gonna be awesome?

388
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:50,066
I'll tell you what
things are gonna be like

389
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,083
three years from now.

390
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,052
Uh, yes, hello. I see

391
00:15:56,086 --> 00:16:00,638
on my frozen entree for one
they printed this number

392
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,341
where I can voice
comments and concerns.

393
00:16:03,343 --> 00:16:06,010
Well, there's more cinnamon

394
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,880
in the cobbler than usual.

395
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:11,249
No, I like cinnamon.

396
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:16,688
Oh, you're very welcome
for my comment.

397
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,258
Wait! Uh, don't go.

398
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,927
Um... do you like cinnamon?

399
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:24,979
Hello? Hello?

400
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:33,855
<i>Marshall, you want
to watch Star Wars?</i>

401
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:35,440
No, can do, old bean!

402
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:36,924
You see, we're up on the Cape

403
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:38,309
living the idyllic
family lifestyle

404
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,760
that you've always dreamed of.

405
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:44,349
Oh, and I'm pregnant
with baby #5!

406
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,317
But baby #4 isn't even out yet.

407
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,069
I'm just that good!

408
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,203
Oh, oh, hold on.

409
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:50,938
There's somebody wants
to say hello to you.

410
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:53,658
Hey, Ted.

411
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,877
I just wanted to say
that things are great,

412
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,896
and I'm married to that
douchey guy in the trucker hat.

413
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:00,331
Whassup, bra?

414
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,451
<i>It turns out it was just you</i>

415
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:05,186
I didn't want to commit to.

416
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:07,121
Oh,

417
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:09,624
and I got back boobs.

418
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,642
So things are great!

419
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:12,944
Buh-bye!

420
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,767
By the way, Ted,
this is Melanie.

421
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,769
You'll be seeing a
lot more of Melanie.

422
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,071
<i>Wait-wait-wait a minute!</i>

423
00:17:23,073 --> 00:17:24,405
Who is Melanie?

424
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,491
Come on, Barney, if there's
one thing I can count on

425
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:27,775
not to change,
it's you walking in

426
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,360
with some random
girl on your arm.

427
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,779
No. No, I don't want that.

428
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,081
For the first time

429
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,199
in my life, I don't
want to find myself

430
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:37,168
in three years
with some random girl,

431
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,153
no matter
how many boobs she has.

432
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:41,889
I want to be with Quinn.

433
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,660
Guys...

434
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:48,880
you're gonna be seeing
a lot more of Quinn.

435
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:51,349
Dude, we've been to the
Lusty Leopard. We've seen plenty.

436
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:54,135
I kind of walked into that one.
All right, bye-bye.

437
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:01,058
What are you doing?

438
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,777
We're living together,
I'm excited about it,

439
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:04,746
and I'm getting rid of my mugs.

440
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:07,315
That was mine.

441
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,734
Sorry. I don't know
which are which.

442
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:13,037
Truth is, I never
drink coffee at home.

443
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,489
This one?
Mm-hmm.

444
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:16,207
There!

445
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,409
I don't need my coffee mugs
'cause I got yours!

446
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,211
For the rest of my life.

447
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:22,964
Or as... long as
you'll have me.

448
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,216
We haven't really talked
about the future.

449
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:27,368
Did I make things awkward?

450
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,803
Just keep smashing mugs.

451
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:32,256
Or donate them.

452
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,091
Point is,

453
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:37,011
I plan on being with you
for a long time.

454
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:38,930
You okay with that?

455
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,386
Sounds great.

456
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:49,807
Ooh.. Oh!

457
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:54,695
I am so sorry.

458
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:55,947
No, no, it's great.

459
00:18:55,949 --> 00:18:59,083
A guy has to be the first one
to let 'er rip.

460
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:01,169
I was actually hoping
this would happen soon.

461
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:03,737
I've been crop-dusting
the patio for weeks.

462
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,573
<i>- The patio!
- Mm-hmm.</i>

463
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:07,575
I've been going
out on the street,

464
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:10,678
like, exactly this time
every night.

465
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,181
Where are you, blond man?!

466
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:15,550
Show yourself!

467
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:18,519
I will be at my mother's.

468
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,754
We're a real couple now,
aren't we?

469
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:22,807
We are.

470
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:32,650
Hey, buddy, I get
that you're bummed.

471
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:35,769
But I got a good feeling
about 2015.

472
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:38,072
I think that's
gonna be your year.

473
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:41,042
<i>Kids, that was the one time
I ever lost faith</i>

474
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:44,278
<i>in the idea that my life
would be better in three years.</i>

475
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,215
<i>And what's funny is,
three years from that moment,</i>

476
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:49,250
<i>my life was amazing.</i>

477
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:50,835
All right!
It's trilogy time!

478
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:52,620
Can I just lodge one complaint?

479
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,055
This is a guy's tradition.

480
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,641
It's kind of a lame move
on Ted's part to bring a chick.

481
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:59,227
Come on, dude...
cut him some slack.

482
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:00,478
I know. He loves her.

483
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,147
She is pretty damn cute.

484
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:05,566
Thank God she takes
after her mother.

485
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:09,020
All right,
let's watch this thing!

486
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:10,688
TV...

487
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,975
<i>play Star Wars trilogy.</i>

488
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:19,447
<i>Play Star Wars tril...</i>

489
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:21,365
You know what?
Screw it.

490
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:26,687
Okay, you are about to see
something awesome.

491
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,489
And just know this:

492
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,741
Han shot first.

493
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:34,262
I wonder if things'll
be a lot different

494
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:37,715
when we watch the trilogy
again in 2018.

495
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:40,067
I hope not.

496
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,880
Oh, that was awesome.

497
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:54,317
You were right--
not weird.

498
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:55,851
No.
