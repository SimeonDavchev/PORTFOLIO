00:00:01,642 --> 00:00:03,969
<i>In May of 2012,
Marshall and Lily</i>

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,844
<i>hosted a baby shower
in the apartment.</i>

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,353
<i>All their friends were there.</i>

4
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:10,006
<i>So of course I made sure
to show up exactly...</i>

5
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:12,392
<i>three hours late.</i>

6
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:15,478
- Oh, no! Am I late?
- Little bit.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,648
Ah, I'm sorry, I would've gotten
here earlier; it's just, um...

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,234
- You didn't want to see Robin.
- I didn't want to see Robin.

9
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:23,436
I know, it's childish.

10
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:24,604
She's not here, is she?

11
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:26,089
Actually...

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,194
Oh, no! Am I early?

13
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:32,895
Little bit.

14
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:37,166
Whoa, she got you
the red stroller?

15
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:41,587
Looks like I just blew her
out of the water.

16
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:44,090
Anyway, he left
before the party started.

17
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:45,908
Ah, I'm really sorry, I...

18
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,877
I just think it's
best if Robin and I

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,629
don't see each
other for a while.

20
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:52,248
Ted, it's fine;
I'm a child of divorce.

21
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,217
You guys keep fighting
all you want,

22
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,269
as long as the expensive gifts
keep coming.

23
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,354
Uh, so how was the shower?

24
00:00:58,356 --> 00:00:59,605
It was good,

25
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:01,307
although there was
one weird moment

26
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,576
with Barney's new
stripper girlfriend.

27
00:01:03,578 --> 00:01:05,228
50 laps a day?

28
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,314
Oh, my goodness, young lady.
That is a lot.

29
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:10,033
Oh, is it?

30
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:12,935
Is it a lot, Grandma Lois?

31
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:15,988
Yes, my girlfriend gets naked

32
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,623
and sits on guys' laps
for money.

33
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,993
And, yes, sometimes it's as
many as 50 laps in one day.

34
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:24,414
And maybe society
considers what she does

35
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,499
to be "disgusting,"

36
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,117
or "slutty,"

37
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,003
or verging on "prostitution,"

38
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:33,956
or actual "prostitution."

39
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,225
But you know what,
I accept her.

40
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:38,678
And if you can't do the same,

41
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,797
well, then shame on you.

42
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,068
Shame...

43
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,302
on...

44
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:47,970
you.

45
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,159
We were, um, talking
about swimming.

46
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:56,829
How I sometimes swim
50 laps a day.

47
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:00,116
Well, it's great cardio.

48
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,086
Lois, can I top off
your champagne?

49
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,128
You know, it's funny,

50
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:20,495
you tell the average guy
you're dating a stripper,

51
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:21,695
he thinks it's awesome.

52
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,260
Heck, you tell your mom,
she high-fives you so fast,

53
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:25,943
she doesn't even
take off her oven mitts.

54
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,963
But if they had any idea

55
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:30,898
The jealousy,

56
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:32,922
the insecurity,

57
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:37,956
those high-fives would be
high-fives of condolence.

58
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:41,658
Barney, condolence high-fives
are not a thing.

59
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,052
They're a thing.

60
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:46,001
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to let you go.

61
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:48,290
Up top.

62
00:02:49,323 --> 00:02:52,842
Ah, listen to me
and my boring couples' problems.

63
00:02:52,844 --> 00:02:54,260
How are you?

64
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:55,695
How's the single life?

65
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:57,997
I wouldn't know.
After this whole Robin thing,

66
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,016
for the time being,
I'm laying low.

67
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,434
Laying low as in

68
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:04,053
sleeping with a really
short chick?

69
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:05,337
You guys doing 39?

70
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,223
I mean, I'm not seeing anyone.

71
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,942
I'm just, you know, trying
to get Robin out of my head.

72
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:11,655
You need a palate cleanser.

73
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:14,041
Barney, please,
don't try to set me up

74
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,119
with Quinn's stripper friends.
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

75
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:18,464
Why not, how many hints
do I have to drop?!

76
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:21,704
No, I'm thinking of something
much more traditional.

77
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,523
Online dating.
Yeah, no thanks.

78
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,542
Come on, Ted! It's 2012.

79
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:29,545
What do you expect,
to meet some cute travel agent

80
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:32,131
when you're reading a newspaper
at a bookstore?

81
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,133
None of those things
exist anymore.

82
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:37,036
Barney, I will never, ever,

83
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:39,872
ever, try online dating.

84
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:41,724
<i>That night
I tried online dating.</i>

85
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:44,894
<i>And kids, the first girl</i>

86
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:49,148
<i>Beautiful, smart, funny, huge
fan of prewar architecture,</i>

87
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,084
<i>favorite poet Neruda,
favorite movie Ghostbusters,</i>

88
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:54,053
and she didn't hate Cleveland.

89
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:55,988
She's perfect.

90
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,723
<i>So I sent her an email,</i>

91
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:00,760
<i>inviting her to mini golf.</i>

92
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,034
- Hello.
- Mini golf?

93
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:10,036
Mini golf? Who takes
a first date to mini golf?

94
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:11,204
I'm coming over!

95
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,757
Oh, Ted-Ted-Ted-
Teddy-Ted-Ted.

96
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,438
Who buzzed you in?

97
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,463
Did you really think you
could start dating online,

98
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:18,594
and I wouldn't find out?

99
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:22,098
But with thi-this
girl, sh-she was...

100
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,016
Me. She was me, Ted.

101
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:26,886
The photo was just of some girl
I knew you'd never seen before,

102
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:29,272
a very famous sports anchor
on ESPN.

103
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:33,309
Barney, I don't need you to
help me find a girl online.

104
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,594
Exactly because I've
already done it!

105
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:37,146
Three girls in fact.

106
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:39,398
I scoured the dating sites

107
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,567
using my own personal
logarithms,

108
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,903
factoring in a broad
spectrum of variables,

109
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:46,405
filtering out undesirable
high-risk negatives,

110
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:49,125
guaranteeing a success
rate of 83...

111
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:51,110
You picked the girls
that showed the most boob.

112
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:53,379
My methods get results.

113
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,882
Go out with these three girls,

114
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:57,750
and your palate is going
to be so cleansed,

115
00:04:57,752 --> 00:04:59,252
you will see
your reflection in it.

116
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:00,887
And when you do,

117
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,723
you can fix the hair, because...
Have you seen yourself?

118
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:06,092
No, but you know
what I have seen,

119
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:08,728
your stripper
girlfriend's cans. Wow.

120
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,845
Wow.
Wow, wow.

121
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:11,814
That was going way
too far, wasn't it?

122
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,316
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:15,401
My condolences.

124
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,904
Come on.

125
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:23,475
Man, Marshall's really
stressing out about this baby.

126
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:24,944
He's reading every book,

127
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:27,113
watching breast-feeding
documentaries.

128
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:30,333
I woke up the other day,
he had swaddled me.

129
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:33,819
Sure, it was the best night's
sleep I had had in months,

130
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,338
but still...

131
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,039
You know
what his latest thing is?

132
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,345
What the hell is that?

133
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,719
Marshall, what is that?

134
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:52,305
I rigged this alarm
to go off every three hours.

135
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:54,340
I'm training myself for the

136
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:57,009
sporadic sleep patterns
of early parenthood.

137
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:58,060
Now, if you'll excuse me,

138
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:01,464
I have a practice-baby
to soothe.

139
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:05,818
You got to talk to him.

140
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
Yeah, I'll talk to him tonight.

141
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:09,622
Maybe tomorrow morning.

142
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:10,689
One last swaddle?

143
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:11,791
It's just so cozy.

144
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:14,377
It's like sleeping
in a warm burrito.

145
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,379
<i>Meanwhile,
Barney was about to have</i>

146
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:18,130
<i>a stripper's boyfriend's
worst nightmare.</i>

147
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:19,665
Karma?

148
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,200
Oh, my gosh,
I didn't recognize you

149
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:22,701
without your legs
behind your head.

150
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,887
Darryl, I didn't recognize you

151
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,255
without your
creepy trench coat.

152
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:27,340
How are you?

153
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:29,225
Great, you working tomorrow?
You know it.

154
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:30,926
Great. I'll be there
with bells on.

155
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:33,679
And by bells,
I mean super thin sweatpants.

156
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,931
Gross.

157
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,684
He's actually a nice guy.

158
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:40,052
She's so busy as deputy mayor,

159
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,904
but I always get a card
on my birthday.

160
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:45,107
Quinn, I love the fact
that you're a stripper,

161
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:47,610
but I hate the fact
that you're a stripper.

162
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:50,579
Barney, I like my job.

163
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:52,748
And I do not need
to be rescued.

164
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,785
So, don't be that guy.

165
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:57,086
You're right, you're right.

166
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:59,372
I got it.
Forget I said anything.

167
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:00,373
Hmm.

168
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,008
I'll see you tonight, Karma.

169
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,709
You got it, Dirty Larry.

170
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,845
You have to quit your job!

171
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:07,296
<i>That night, I went out</i>

172
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:09,348
<i>with the first girl
Barney picked for me.</i>

173
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,716
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

174
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:12,635
Your name is Robin?

175
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:14,603
Yeah, with a Y.

176
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:17,223
<i>Oh, Yobin.</i>

177
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:18,974
No, Robyn.

178
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:22,094
I go by ScotchAndGunLover
in my online profile,

179
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:23,946
'cause those are
my two favorite things.

180
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:27,099
Well, next to Canada,
my home and native land.

181
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:29,869
Oh. Canada.

182
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:31,821
<i>And just like that,</i>

183
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:34,373
<i>Robyn became Robin.</i>

184
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,909
How's it going, Ted?

185
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:45,126
Oh, good. Hey, look,
mommy's back from the bar!

186
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:47,191
Now I can finally take a shower.

187
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:52,675
This diaper smells.
I don't want to know.

188
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:54,816
Okay, Marshall,

189
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:57,118
sit down; we need to talk.

190
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,272
Look, I know you mean well,

191
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,791
but we have five weeks
till the due date.

192
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:06,578
Can't we use this
time to just relax?

193
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,613
We'll figure out
how all this stuff

194
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,448
works after the baby comes.

195
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,166
After the baby comes?

196
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:13,951
Yeah, we'll learn on the job.

197
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:16,254
Learn on the j... Huh.

198
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:18,590
Wow, you know, Lily,

199
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:21,342
maybe the crisis here isn't that
I'm not ready to be a dad;

200
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,595
Maybe it's that
you're not ready to be a mom!

201
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:24,795
Excuse me?!
Yeah.

202
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:26,297
<i>With that, an argument began,</i>

203
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,983
<i>the details of which are still
hotly debated to this day.</i>

204
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:31,603
<i>- For instance, Uncle Marshall-</i>

205
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:34,050
I'm the only one making
sacrifices for this baby!

206
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:34,521
What?!

207
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:36,858
<i>- And he claims he never-</i>

208
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,643
It's like you don't even know
that you're pregnant!

209
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:41,112
<i>- While Lily insists-</i>

210
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:43,014
Baby's are easy; you just

211
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:45,116
watch them be cute
and feed them spaghetti!

212
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:48,036
<i>- But everyone agrees-</i>

213
00:08:48,038 --> 00:08:50,755
Marshall, what I need now
is some peace, some quiet,

214
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:52,540
and now that it's out there,
some spaghetti.

215
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,760
Now, please help me off
the couch so I can storm out.

216
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,597
Huh!

217
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:05,470
<i>The next day,
I filled Barney in on my date.</i>

218
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:07,838
Oh, Yobin.

219
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,340
No, Robyn.

220
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,142
And for the rest of the night,

221
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:14,278
every time I looked at her,
I just saw Robin's face.

222
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,814
Well, I should hope so.
No, our Robin.

223
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:18,182
Robin with an I.

224
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:20,284
Uh, our Robin has
two eyes, my friend.

225
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:22,537
But that's good. You're
forgetting what she looks like.

226
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,823
I'm sorry, that must
have been tough.

227
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:28,076
If anyone knows what
that feels like, it's me.

228
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:30,078
My condolences.

229
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,633
Okay. Moving on.

230
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:38,636
Perfect palate cleanser.

231
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:39,971
Nothing like Robin.

232
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:41,205
How nothing?

233
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,808
I gaze out into the world
and all I see

234
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,378
is an icy place
where dreams die.

235
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:51,265
Ooh, lasagna.

236
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,735
How's it going, Ted?

237
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:55,737
What? No. What? Wh-Why?

238
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,855
Remember, I made lasagna
that one time.

239
00:09:57,857 --> 00:09:59,190
That's all it takes?

240
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:01,693
It wasn't even lasagna;
You took your botched kugle

241
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:03,244
and poured tomato sauce on it.

242
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,947
I didn't say
it was good lasagna.

243
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:08,599
By the way, what are you doing
with this girl?

244
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:11,035
With tattoos all up
and down her arms and...

245
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:14,922
everywhere else.
Hello... good gravy.

246
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:17,341
Does that dragons tail go
all the way down to her...

247
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:20,077
Ohh, yes, it does.

248
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,130
Well, what do you want me
to do, Robin?

249
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,931
I have to get over you somehow,

250
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,583
and if this is what it takes...

251
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,535
Are you okay?

252
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,555
Yeah. Why?

253
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:33,057
You kind of spaced out there.

254
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:34,892
Weirdo.

255
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:37,645
"So, in summation,

256
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,030
I'm very, very sorry."

257
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:41,199
"I guess I just wanted
you all to myself,

258
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,901
"and then I thought of all the
creepy guys groping at your...

259
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:45,203
"Okay, I'm getting mad again,

260
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:46,604
"so I'm going to
stop writing now.

261
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:50,208
Please enjoy these chocolates,
may contain peanuts."

262
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,392
Kiss and make up?

263
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:57,448
Have sex up against the window
and make up? -

264
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,447
You do have a great view.

265
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,442
Well, funny you
should mention that.

266
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:02,676
<i>It's your view.</i>

267
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:04,608
Come again for Big Fudge?

268
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,652
Congratulations. You're hired.

269
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:08,837
You are Goliath National Bank's

270
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,669
newest executive
strategy coordinator.

271
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:14,732
What is an executive
strategy coordinator?

272
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,818
It's three
corporate-sounding words

273
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,070
which, when added together,
equal a fake job

274
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:21,522
for which you get
a real paycheck

275
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:24,141
in the amount of exactly
what you'd make stripping.

276
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,143
Plus dental. You're welcs.

277
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,246
Now, about that
up-against-the-window sex...

278
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:30,031
Dude, I don't want
to work for a bank.

279
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:30,915
Why not?

280
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,900
Because I have standards.

281
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:34,252
You people are whores.

282
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:36,487
The things you're willing
to do just for some money,

283
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:37,988
it's shameful.

284
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,324
You work in a strip club.

285
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:42,260
Yeah, and I like it.

286
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:43,828
And I'm good at it.

287
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,879
Barney,

288
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,632
if I took this job,
you would own me.

289
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:49,350
I would be willingly
stepping into a cage,

290
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:51,018
which is something I don't do.

291
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,721
Except on Thursdays, when it's
cage night at the Lusty Leopard,

292
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:54,889
but that's a cardboard cage,

293
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:57,191
and I can get out of it
any time I want.

294
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,392
You can?

295
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:00,645
Wow, thanks
for ruining cage night.

296
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:02,209
- Come on, Quinn.
- No.

297
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,089
I wouldn't...
Nope.

298
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,366
Don't.

299
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:07,518
I think I have
some thinking to do.

300
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,454
I...

301
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:11,622
Mr. Stinson?

302
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,374
Does this mean
I get to keep my job?

303
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:16,611
Yeah, Herm, you can stay.

304
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:18,296
Hey, baby, listen.

305
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:20,364
I'm-I'm sorry I flipped out.

306
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,632
Oh, that's okay.

307
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:23,918
To be fair, maybe I'm at fault

308
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,703
for loving our child too much,

309
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,055
although that is the definition
of parenting, so...

310
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,206
All right, good make up.

311
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,808
Hey, listen, I went online,

312
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,927
and I found
this Baby Boot Camp thing

313
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,646
that they're doing at a hotel
in Paramus this weekend.

314
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:36,898
Baby Boot Camp?

315
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,149
That sounds great.

316
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:39,433
Yeah, it's a two-day event...

317
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,551
We're going.

318
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:42,186
And there's lots
of seminars and classes.

319
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:43,571
You've already made the sale.

320
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:44,640
Anyway, I signed us up.

321
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,655
Not even listening anymore;
Mentally packing.

322
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,499
I'm trying to figure out
the best way to get to Paramus

323
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:49,744
without hitting any tolls.

324
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,061
This is gonna be great.

325
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,335
And that was the last time

326
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,168
I'll ever go out with a guy
with a mustache.

327
00:12:58,371 --> 00:12:59,620
<i>This is good.</i>

328
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:02,123
<i>This is nice, not thinking
about you-know-who.</i>

329
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,041
<i>Just having a good time</i>

330
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:06,127
<i>and thanking God I didn't grow
that mustache.</i>

331
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:07,578
And you,

332
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,914
you're so polite.

333
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,601
My ex-fiancé, Wayne,
he had no manners.

334
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:15,136
<i>Wayne had no manners.</i>

335
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:16,971
<i>Wayne... manners...</i>

336
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:20,308
<i>Wayne Manor,
home of Bruce Wayne,</i>

337
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,126
<i>better known as Batman,</i>

338
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:24,695
<i>mentor to Dick Grayson,
his orphan ward</i>

339
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:26,898
<i>who at night would don
the colorful vestments</i>

340
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,816
<i>of the Boy Wonder, aka...</i>

341
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:30,568
Robin.

342
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,461
Holy long walk for a short drink
of water, Ted.

343
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:34,454
Stop this.

344
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:36,729
I need you out of my life
for real.

345
00:13:36,753 --> 00:13:38,191
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

346
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:39,218
No, you don't.

347
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:40,996
Look how much is changing
right now.

348
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:43,468
Marshall and Lily
are having a baby.

349
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,282
Barney's shacking up
with a girl.

350
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,417
With your whole world

351
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:47,885
turning upside down,

352
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:49,303
isn't a friendship like this one

353
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:52,757
something you want to hold on to
as tightly as possible?

354
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:58,396
And every time I look at you,
it hurts.

355
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,898
and that's the story
of my only lesbian experience.

356
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,350
I'm sorry

357
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:04,318
for going into so much detail.

358
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,771
I'll never tell
that story again.

359
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:08,472
Anyway, how's your meal?

360
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:10,808
Holly, listen,
I should probably tell you,

361
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,495
um, I'm kind of getting
over someone right now.

362
00:14:14,497 --> 00:14:16,948
I am so glad you said that.

363
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,483
I guess I'm still
getting over Wayne.

364
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,335
It's been really hard.

365
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:23,721
Can I interest you
in some sorbet?

366
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,624
You two look like you could both
use a palate cleanser.

367
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,332
How's your palate, Ted?

368
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:36,517
Pretty cleansed.

369
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:41,042
You know, at this seminar,

370
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,564
there's gonna be the
one guy who's, like,

371
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:45,845
Mr. Parenting Expert, keeps
interrupting the speakers

372
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,700
with his own "important facts."

373
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:50,031
And you're gonna be sitting
right next to him,

374
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:52,533
so get ready for that.

375
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:55,069
Baby, you've been a little
sleep deprived lately.

376
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:57,121
Why don't you let me drive?

377
00:14:57,123 --> 00:15:00,024
You know what, that's
not such a bad idea.

378
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:02,192
I mean, the last thing we want

379
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:05,629
is for me to get
behind the wheel and just...

380
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:17,341
Oh, baby, you smell good.

381
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:19,810
When we get to that hotel,

382
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:22,396
I'm gonna wear
your pregnant belly like a hat.

383
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:24,015
You'll have to buy me

384
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:25,566
a couple of cocktails first.

385
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:27,217
Bar-Barney!

386
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,886
Where are we?

387
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:31,906
Atlantic City, baby!

388
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:34,075
Well, in 14 miles.

389
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:40,796
What the hell is going on?

390
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,129
And where is Lily?

391
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:44,632
And what did you do
to the practice baby?

392
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:46,967
And is there any left?

393
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,633
Lily was worried about you.

394
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:51,914
She thought you needed
to unwind, so...

395
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:55,142
I mean, the last thing
we want is for me to

396
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:57,578
get behind the wheel
and just...

397
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,418
<i>She made reservations
for two deluxe rooms,</i>

398
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,869
<i>massages, and dinner
at the Palm,</i>

399
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:08,839
<i>and in return,
I made her cookies.</i>

400
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:14,544
So, there's no Baby Boot Camp
at the Paramus Waldorf?

401
00:16:16,164 --> 00:16:17,882
Is there even a Paramus Waldorf?

402
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,351
Bro...

403
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,772
I am so mad at Lily right now.

404
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:25,377
She knew you would be;
That's why she packed this.

405
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:27,665
Aw.

406
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,643
My mad-at-Lily shirt.

407
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:32,702
I had this made for me

408
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,735
and my high school
girlfriend, Steph.

409
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,117
In reality,
"Marshall and Steph 4-eva"

410
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,201
turned out to be

411
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:40,037
"Marshall and Steph
for two days

412
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:43,573
until Steph's boyfriend
got out of juvie a week early."

413
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,375
Drives Lily crazy
when I wear it.

414
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:49,337
I hope she's miserable
without me.

415
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:56,019
Hey, Ted, how's tricks?

416
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:57,387
Tricks are pretty good, Lou.

417
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,590
Had some girl trouble
earlier in the week, but, uh,

418
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,692
I got a feeling from here on
out, things are gonna be A...

419
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:05,195
O-Oh, you son of a bitch.

420
00:17:05,197 --> 00:17:07,564
Hello.

421
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:10,562
Lily's right.

422
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:11,914
I've been acting crazy.

423
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,190
No, it's okay, bro.

424
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,815
I mean, yeah,
you've been a little crazy,

425
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:17,244
but it comes from love.

426
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:19,417
It's the same kind of crazy
that makes a man

427
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,700
offer his stripper girlfriend
over half a million dollars

428
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:23,951
of government bailout money,

429
00:17:23,953 --> 00:17:25,736
not to rub up
on other guys' junk.

430
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,187
It's good crazy.

431
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:34,128
I hope Lily's okay.
Okay,

432
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,362
you know, that's it, bro.

433
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:37,197
We're both turning off
our phones for one hour.

434
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,299
Motion denied.

435
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:41,218
Okay, you leave me no choice.

436
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,056
You give me one hour
of phone-free bro time,

437
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:47,842
during which we,
and by we I mean you,

438
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:50,845
get magnificently,
mythologically drunk.

439
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,548
I'm talking needing-subtitles-
when-you-speak drunk.

440
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,051
If you can give me that,

441
00:17:57,053 --> 00:18:00,187
I will wear this.

442
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:01,272
The ducky tie?

443
00:18:01,274 --> 00:18:02,656
I thought you threw
that thing away.

444
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:04,108
I did.

445
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,060
It came back.

446
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:07,728
All right, Barney,

447
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,580
you got yourself a deal.

448
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:15,619
Um, excuse me, miss.

449
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:16,954
Um, when you get a chance,

450
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:20,925
could you bring over a hundred
shots of tequila, please?

451
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:22,526
I'll have the same.

452
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:28,315
Why are you still here?

453
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,934
Why do you think I'm still here?

454
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:32,770
I guess because I'm
in love with you.

455
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:36,090
Why else would I be seeing
your face everywhere I look?

456
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:37,758
Because you feel bad.

457
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,777
Of course I feel bad.

458
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,595
I told you I love you,

459
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:45,232
which is apparently the worst
thing you can say to someone.

460
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:46,901
That's not why you feel bad.

461
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:49,320
You feel bad because
after you said it,

462
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:50,971
you let me go away.

463
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,207
I know our relationship

464
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:55,459
isn't exactly
what you want it to be,

465
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:57,461
and I know I may not love you

466
00:18:57,463 --> 00:19:01,449
the way you love me,
but I do love you.

467
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,302
Isn't that worth hanging on to?

468
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:12,927
I miss you.

469
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:15,412
So go get me back.

470
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:23,804
Robin?

471
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:24,989
Ted.

472
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:26,240
It's good to really see you.

473
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:27,858
It's really good to see you.

474
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,160
Look, I think we need to talk.

475
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:31,529
Uh, me, too,
but now's not a good time.

476
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:32,363
Why not?

477
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:34,448
I am proud of you, bro.

478
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,867
You turned off your phone
for one hour,

479
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:38,285
and you got so drunk...

480
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:44,959
Exactly.

481
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,794
Hey,.

482
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:48,129
Yes, Marshall?

483
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:52,449
Well, I don't see why not.

484
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:58,289
Whoa! I've got
17 new voicemails.

485
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,640
Barney, it's Lily.

486
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:01,942
You guys need to get back
to New York right away.

487
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,010
I'm in labor.

488
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:07,014
All hail Beercules!

489
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:08,482
Yeah!

490
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:21,632
All right, Barney,
you got yourself a deal.

491
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,075
Hey, you've reached Marshall.

492
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:29,680
Please leave a message.

493
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,620
Hey, baby, it's me.

494
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:33,191
I think I'm in labor.

495
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,896
We should do this
every weekend.

496
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,965
Okay, this is real.

497
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:40,179
It's not a false alarm.

498
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:41,445
This is real; I'm in labor.

499
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:43,796
I kind of need you
to call me back now.

500
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,784
How does somebody so little

501
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,070
have such strong fingers?

502
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:49,581
Where are you?

503
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,848
Call me!

504
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,768
He is the manager
of the Paramus Waldorf.

505
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,522
You come to Paramus,
we will hook you up.

506
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,474
If you're trying
to get back at me,

507
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:03,381
you have chosen a wildly
inappropriate way of doing so!

508
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:08,593
Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah.
