1
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:05,080
<i>Kids, in October 2011,
your Aunt Robin was in therapy.</i>

2
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:07,614
<i>And against all logic,
it was actually going well.</i>

3
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:09,337
But why?

4
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:12,140
Why-why am I constantly looking
for reasons not to be happy?

5
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:15,227
Maybe because the idea of
finally being happy...

6
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:16,928
terrifies you.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,115
Bro, you are killing it today.

8
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:21,766
Pshh!

9
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:24,319
We got something good here.

10
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:26,771
We are totes gonna conquer
my fear of abandonment!

11
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,206
I can't see you anymore.

12
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,375
Nice.

13
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:32,410
"Oh, no! You're
abandoning me!"

14
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:35,446
Oh, no. You're abandoning me?

15
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:38,383
I'm sorry.
I'm moving to Alaska.

16
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:41,837
<i>And that might have
been the end of it.</i>

17
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:43,088
<i>But a week later...</i>

18
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,140
Kevin?!

19
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,309
What are you doing here?

20
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:51,596
Okay, look, I lied to you
about moving to Alaska.

21
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,765
I-I had to stop seeing you.

22
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,050
Why?

23
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:57,369
'Cause I think you're cute.

24
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:59,204
And ethically,
I can't be your therapist

25
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:01,039
if I'm attracted to you.

26
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,641
Oh, I get it. You dump me
as a patient

27
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,327
just so you can ask me out?

28
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,461
I'm not gonna ask you out.

29
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:07,796
You're not?

30
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:10,632
No. We met in therapy.

31
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:13,401
It's inappropriate for me
to date a patient.

32
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,521
Anyway, it was nice seeing you.

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,325
Hey, wait.

34
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,826
How do you define "date"?

35
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:24,963
Two people having a meal
together,

36
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,014
sitting across the table

37
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,465
making googly eyes
at each other...

38
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:31,803
What about two people eating
alone, sitting side by side,

39
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:35,006
making googly eyes
at the coffee maker?

40
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,526
Okay, it's not a date.

41
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:38,944
Exactly. Not a date.

42
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:41,813
<i>And so Robin and Kevin had
breakfast alone,</i>

43
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:46,234
<i>side by side
every day that week.</i>

44
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,204
<i>Until finally...</i>

45
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,527
Oh, hey!

46
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,329
Sorry. No cabs.

47
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:59,030
Ran 40 blocks
all the way here.

48
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:00,382
May have knocked an old lady

49
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,033
into the street,
don't know, I didn't look back.

50
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,084
Let's just go on a real date.

51
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:04,753
Yeah, that might be a good idea.

52
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,221
Finally!

53
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:21,321
♪

54
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,408
Oh, I can't wait
to see that movie.

55
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,376
Is it good?

56
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,594
Awesome. Wait, totally
hypothetically,

57
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:28,046
do you like movies with a
shocking twist where all

58
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,765
the main characters die
at the end?

59
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:30,883
Yes.

60
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,184
You will love this movie.

61
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,519
Hey, guys.

62
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,770
Hey, Marshall.
What's up?

63
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,438
Well, I'll tell you what's up.

64
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,624
You know how my boss,
Garrison Cootes, is,

65
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,559
like, the most famous
environmental lawyer

66
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,376
in the world?

67
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:43,028
Yeah...

68
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,398
I mean, it's him
or the other guy.

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,733
Sir Anthony Howel?

70
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,119
Yeah...

71
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:52,237
Anyway, he's an important guy,
okay?

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,806
And so today at work,

73
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:55,958
I was trying to show him
that I'm tough.

74
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,793
I've been thinking
about this

75
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:59,044
settlement offer we're about

76
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,130
to get from Gruber
Pharmaceuticals.

77
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:03,048
If it's anything less
than $20 million,

78
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,115
then I'm gonna grab

79
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,885
those corporate Earth rapists
by their...

80
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,887
Okay, I'm just gonna
say something.

81
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,806
I'm growing a child
in my belly,

82
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:12,724
a child that just
developed ears.

83
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,394
This is a very
thin sweater.

84
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,146
So please, if you must
tell your story...

85
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:18,764
just make it
cheerful.

86
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,382
Cheerful.

87
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:22,518
Okay...

88
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,236
Then I'm gonna grab those
corporate...

89
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,671
employees...

90
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,639
by their sweaty, dangling...

91
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,657
hands...

92
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,309
and squeeze until those greedy
sons of...

93
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,612
parents... realize that
I'm the baddest mother...

94
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,498
nature lover around.

95
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,334
<i>It's like watching
The Breakfast Club on TBS.</i>

96
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,253
So what did he say?

97
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:45,924
Marshall, bend down so I
can put my arm around you.

98
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,043
That's all the way down.
That's good.

99
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:50,012
Gruber Pharmaceuticals
is a company full

100
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:51,964
of well-meaning people
doing their jobs,

101
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,049
just like you and me.

102
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:56,802
Guys, I'm afraid that Garrison
Cootes has gone soft!

103
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,804
He's like a teddy bear!

104
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,390
A teddy bear
or an Ewok?

105
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:03,559
You know, cute and cuddly
around the village,

106
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:05,477
but once the battle starts...

107
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,864
He'll smash in your metal skull
with giant swinging logs.

108
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:09,982
Marshall!

109
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,233
Okay, he'll hug you

110
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:13,652
until you agree to peaceably
shut down the Death Star.

111
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,853
Hi, sweetie.

112
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:15,971
Hey.

113
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:17,689
What are we
all talking about?

114
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,807
Ewoks.

115
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,075
Ugh, I hate the Ewoks.

116
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:22,294
The only good
thing about Ewoks in that movie?

117
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,195
You got to see some of them die.

118
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,832
Well, I fancy a pint.

119
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,801
Nora hates Ewoks.

120
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,703
Well, I have
to break up with her.

121
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,739
Be gentle
when you tell her, guys.

122
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,341
I'll call you from Vegas.
Tell me how it went. Okay.

123
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,309
Okay, Barney!

124
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,376
Sit down!

125
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,711
Not liking Ewoks

126
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,231
is no reason not
to date somebody.

127
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,816
Yeah, I mean, who knows
what the rules are, ya know?

128
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,486
I mean, you're dating
a girl who doesn't like Ewoks,

129
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,387
I'm dating my former
therapist.

130
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,439
- Oh!
- Eww!

131
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,274
We are
gentlemen of Harvard!

132
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:53,708
It's not a big deal!

133
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,521
Robin, if you asked
a hundred people,

134
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:57,365
"Who's the worst person
you could possibly date?"

135
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,947
they'd all say,
"Your therapist."

136
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:00,699
Except the ones
saying "Barney."

137
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,085
Hey! Yeah, that tracks.

138
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,903
Well, I should
get going.

139
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,755
I got the big field
trip tomorrow.

140
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:07,623
Field trip?

141
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,457
Yeah. I'm taking

142
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:09,625
my Intro to
Architecture class

143
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:11,176
to the GNB Tower
construction site.

144
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,594
I'm trying to get
them interested

145
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:14,179
in architecture
as a career.

146
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,247
Why? Are we running out
of buildings?

147
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,716
Are we running out
of boring people?

148
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,468
Guys, this is
a big deal, okay?

149
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,603
If I can get just
one kid interested in

150
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:22,754
becoming an architect...

151
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,274
Okay, I'm just gonna stop
you right there.

152
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:27,309
Ted, it's an Intro class.

153
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,513
<i>Yeah, don't try to
Stand and Deliver</i>

154
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:30,262
an Intro class.

155
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,315
Nobody takes an Intro class
to get on any other path

156
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:36,068
but the path to not
being hungover anymore.

157
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,155
I learned that in my Intro
to something-ology class.

158
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,574
Well that's fine for
something-ology,

159
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,876
but tomorrow
at 9:00 a.m. sharp

160
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,080
Intro to Architecture is
going on a field trip!

161
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,464
All 200 of 'em.

162
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:50,482
Well, it's 9:45.

163
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:53,051
I guess the other 170
of you got lost,

164
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,419
so we'll just start.

165
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,923
Now, some might say you guys are
just taking this class

166
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:01,393
because it's easy or because
you've confused architecture

167
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,178
with archaeology and think
we're gonna do

168
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,963
some cool
Indiana Jones stuff today.

169
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,765
But I think that...

170
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:13,488
I think just maybe, we got some
future architects in the house.

171
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,110
Show of hands: who's thinking
about a career in architecture?

172
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,031
Well, today,
all that's gonna change.

173
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,983
Follow me.

174
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,370
Hey. Uh, sorry,

175
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,272
nobody gets in here
without a site pass.

176
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:33,875
It's okay, I'm Ted Mosby, the
architect of this building.

177
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:36,294
I don't care if you're the
archaeologist of this building.

178
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,429
Site's closed.

179
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,653
Moving on!

180
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,622
<i>That morning, Marshall's firm</i>

181
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:49,274
<i>was getting
the settlement offer</i>

182
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,727
<i>from Gruber Pharmaceuticals,
and Marshall couldn't wait</i>

183
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:54,780
<i>to see the teddy bear
turn into an Ewok.</i>

184
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:58,683
Gruber Pharmaceuticals dumped
toxic waste into Frog Creek,

185
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,370
a tributary of the Trout River
that feeds into Clearwater Lake.

186
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:04,539
All three of which
now need new names.

187
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:10,361
So it's time to win one
for Mother Earth.

188
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,581
Let's take out the trash,
shall we?!

189
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,833
- Yes!
- All right, everyone grab a bag.

190
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,635
Blue is recycling,
green, compost.

191
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,637
There we go.

192
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,706
Sheila...

193
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,825
we're ready to hear your offer.

194
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,489
$24,000?

195
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,279
Yeah , that seems reasonable.

196
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,342
<i>Kids, I was wandering the city</i>

197
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:52,324
<i>with 25 Intro to Architecture
students</i>

198
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,359
<i>when your Uncle Barney
came to my rescue.</i>

199
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:57,996
Okay, guys, seeing a building
get built, not that exciting.

200
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:00,698
What's really exciting is the
financial side of...

201
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,166
Sit down, Ted, I got this.

202
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:05,420
Hey, Weird Beard, lights!

203
00:08:05,422 --> 00:08:07,705
College...
it's a confusing time.

204
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:08,806
Oh, no.

205
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:12,527
Studies show that 83% of all
college students

206
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:14,562
desperately need...

207
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:16,548
sex lessons!

208
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,433
Lights!

209
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:20,585
Barney, these are
18-year-olds!

210
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,921
Ted, these are 18-year-olds!

211
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:26,257
You have a girlfriend.

212
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,475
But she doesn't like Ewoks!

213
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:28,359
So what?

214
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:32,447
So what?!
Bieber, lights!

215
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:37,986
In 1983, George Lucas introduced
the world to the Ewoks,

216
00:08:37,988 --> 00:08:41,723
a race of creatures indigenous
to the second moon of Endor.

217
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:43,725
Now, the Ewoks have
a rich back-story

218
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:45,126
that the movie didn't
really go into.

219
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:46,294
Barney, why don't
you just skip

220
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:48,379
to the part
about you and Nora?

221
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:50,131
Fine.

222
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:00,958
Ah, yes.

223
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,229
<i>Ultimately, Ewoks split Star
Wars fandom into two camps:</i>

224
00:09:05,231 --> 00:09:10,318
those born before, and those
born after May 25, 1973:

225
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,521
the Ewok Line.

226
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:16,608
Anyone born on this side
of the Ewok Line was

227
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,010
at least ten years
old when Jedi came out,

228
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:23,314
and thus too old for something
so cloying and cute.

229
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:30,254
Anyone born on this side
loved the Ewoks because, why?

230
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,291
They reminded you of...

231
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:34,375
Our teddies?

232
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:36,844
They reminded you
of your teddies.

233
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:38,680
Thank you, Gina.

234
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:40,465
How do you know her name?

235
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:45,002
And so... by the immutable laws
of the Ewok Line,

236
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:49,474
my 29-year-old girlfriend
who hates Ewoks

237
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:55,196
must in fact be
no younger than... 37.

238
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:57,482
That's only a year younger
than Will's mom.

239
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:59,701
How do you know my mom?
Class dismissed!

240
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:01,202
I need to be alone.

241
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:02,687
All right, we're moving on.

242
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,072
Ooh, can I come?

243
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:06,157
Hey, baby.

244
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,661
Hey, I just want to remind you
we have Dr. Sonya at 4:00.

245
00:10:09,663 --> 00:10:12,363
I'll be there. I'm sorry.
I'm just... I'm bummed.

246
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:14,916
We got
our settlement offer today:

247
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:18,202
$24,000 from
a billion-dollar company.

248
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:20,655
Wow. I take it people aren't
happy about that.

249
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:23,708
We won! Champagne and cake
for everybody!

250
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,842
They're celebrating.

251
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:25,843
I mean, it's crazy.

252
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:28,312
We have no right
to be eating cake.

253
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:30,732
There's cake?! I'm on my way!

254
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:34,218
<i>Meanwhile, the worst field trip
of all time was still trucking.</i>

255
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,188
<i>All right, this, this is
exciting, okay?</i>

256
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,573
This is the very room

257
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:41,025
where I had the idea
for the GNB Tower.

258
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:43,894
Now, Webster's defines
"inspiration" as...

259
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:46,581
Hold on.
It's still loading.

260
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,582
Uh, hey, roomie.

261
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:50,284
Robin! Hey,
what are you doing here?

262
00:10:50,286 --> 00:10:53,037
<i>Well, I was about
to get my swerve on.</i>

263
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,922
You were?

264
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:57,341
So you're the therapist.

265
00:10:57,343 --> 00:11:00,461
You know, it's one thing
to pretend to be a shrink

266
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,513
and bang your patients.
That's normal.

267
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:06,217
But to do it for real?
A little creepy, bro.

268
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:07,802
Okay, it's not creepy.

269
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:09,887
Ehhhh... it's creepy.

270
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,723
Class, show of hands:

271
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:14,592
Who thinks it's creepy
to date your therapist?

272
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:16,227
- Pollstered.
- Get out!

273
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,262
All right.
We're moving on!

274
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:19,597
So, class, to your left,

275
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:22,283
you will see some
excellent examples of

276
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:25,953
what we'd call windows.

277
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:27,789
So where are we going now?

278
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,790
I have no idea.

279
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,291
This is a disaster.

280
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:32,276
Some of them are already
starting to go home.

281
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,962
Although we seem to have
picked up a German family.

282
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:36,881
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

283
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:39,617
That thing with Robin
and her creepy therapist

284
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:40,618
gave me an idea.

285
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,587
Ted, we have here a way

286
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:45,456
to solve every single debate
we've ever had!

287
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,291
I mean, just look at the sample:

288
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:50,344
guys, girls,
blacks, Asians, a German family.

289
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:52,930
You can't pay for that kind of
focus group!

290
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:55,633
Is macaroni salad
really a salad?

291
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:57,134
Hands up if you say "no."

292
00:11:58,136 --> 00:11:59,153
Ha!

293
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:00,154
Jacob or Edward?

294
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:01,138
Who says Edward?

295
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,107
Ha, ha. See?
I told you.

296
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:05,493
It's Edward
James Olmos.

297
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:09,163
Would you rather have sex
with a dead human being

298
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:11,916
or a live an...?
Dude.

299
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:13,484
What?
Find the line.

300
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,953
Who thinks David
Hasselhoff is awesome?

301
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:18,623
Hmm.
It's true.

302
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,341
Okay. I've got one.
If you're dating a girl,

303
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:21,843
and she lies
about her age,

304
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,811
who says break up
with her?

305
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:26,047
Yes, yes, but what if
the person she's lying to

306
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,165
is notoriously
shallow about age?

307
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,518
Okay, but what if early
in our relationship,

308
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,853
she made a really big deal

309
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,471
about wanting to not
lie to each other?

310
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:35,523
What if she's hot?

311
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:37,558
Who wants five bucks?

312
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:40,144
Pollstered!

313
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:41,646
Let's do this.

314
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,852
Hmm? Yeah.

315
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:49,871
Mm...

316
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:51,372
Okay, this is creepy.

317
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:52,874
It's Crispin
Glover creepy.

318
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:54,292
You were my patient.

319
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:55,576
You shared intimate stuff.

320
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:57,378
It would be like dating
your gynecologist.

321
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,497
You were vulnerable.

322
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:01,999
That's not something
we can move past.

323
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:04,168
Guess not.

324
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:08,389
So, dating your gyno,
that's bad, too?

325
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:09,557
Oh, Robin.

326
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,259
Kidding!

327
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:12,960
Look, we've got another one!

328
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:16,380
Come on,
have a bite.

329
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:18,266
No, it's a matter
of principle.

330
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:19,734
I don't care how good it is,

331
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:21,352
I'm not gonna have
a third piece of cake!

332
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:25,389
Okay, guys, you all had
a lot of fun today,

333
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:28,276
but now it's time...
to have even more fun!

334
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:30,478
Another cake!

335
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,246
Another cake?!

336
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:34,198
What is the matter
with you people?!

337
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,736
That settlement today was
a flaming pile of...

338
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,638
puppies...

339
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,423
that aren't on fire!

340
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,592
Look at what's happening
to the environment,

341
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:46,294
and we're here doing the limbo?

342
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:49,380
I mean, we should be ashamed
of ourselves!

343
00:13:57,723 --> 00:14:00,391
Sir, all I meant was...

344
00:14:00,393 --> 00:14:02,777
Ten years from right now,

345
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,930
everyone outside in that bullpen
will be dead.

346
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,398
What?

347
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,317
I've seen the
latest research, Marsh.

348
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,885
You know how I'm always saying

349
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:12,904
it's not too late
to save the planet?

350
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,939
It's too late
to save the planet.

351
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:18,125
There's nothing to do
but sit back

352
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,812
and await our inevitable doom.

353
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:24,782
Oh, my goodness, a piñata!

354
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,217
Just give me one minute, Larry.

355
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:27,785
Thank you.

356
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:31,138
Our grotesque, inevitable doom!

357
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,925
Now, of course,
you can't go around

358
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:34,976
telling all the people

359
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,727
<i>that the good ship
Environmentalism</i>

360
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:38,295
has sailed off into the sunset.

361
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:39,931
There would cause a panic.

362
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:41,782
So, instead,
what we do is,

363
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:44,235
we come to work,
we put on a happy face,

364
00:14:44,237 --> 00:14:46,487
and we sue the big guys

365
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,973
for just enough money
for some cake

366
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:53,444
before the unfiltered rays
of the sun fry us like chalupas,

367
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:56,414
and our lungs fill up
with salt water,

368
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,833
and we all die!

369
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:01,419
Mmm. This cake is delicious.
Everything's fine.

370
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:06,645
Ugh, this day sucks.

371
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,203
Kevin and I are kaputski.

372
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,821
You think that's bad?

373
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,157
The world is
coming to an end.

374
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,059
You think that's bad?

375
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:19,196
My girlfriend is 37!

376
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,500
And my field trip is not going
as well as I'd hoped.

377
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:24,652
Hmm.

378
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:26,554
This day sucks.

379
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:29,173
Professor Mosby,
is the field trip over?

380
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,008
We'd like to go home.

381
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,593
Yeah, it's over.

382
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:34,762
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

383
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:36,430
I just wanted
to inspire them,

384
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:39,883
you know, like my professors
inspired me.

385
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:43,104
But here we are,
at the end of the day...

386
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:44,655
Hey, class,
quick question.

387
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,408
Uh, is anyone here thinking
of becoming an architect?

388
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,749
Really?

389
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:56,918
Yeah, dude.
I mean,

390
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,569
all jobs suck,

391
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,571
but it's 4:00
in the afternoon,

392
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,540
and you're out at a bar
with your friends,

393
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,759
so the hours can't
be that bad.

394
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,377
So...

395
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:08,763
yeah, I don't know,
I'd think about it.

396
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:12,082
I got through to you. Oh!

397
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:15,753
I mean, that is, if becoming
a deejay doesn't pan out.

398
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:18,973
You are gonna be
a great architect.

399
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:21,091
<i>He became a deejay.</i>

400
00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:25,062
Robin, what are you doing here?

401
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:26,604
I told you I can't
be your therapist.

402
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:27,449
I know.

403
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,933
Today, I am your therapist.

404
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:30,934
What?

405
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,153
You said yourself,

406
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:34,405
I'm always looking for reasons
not to be happy.

407
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:36,324
Well, I'm trying to change that.

408
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,442
So, if the only reason
we can't be together

409
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:40,444
is because I was
in a vulnerable place

410
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:42,129
for the first two hours
we knew each other

411
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:46,417
then that is two hours of
vulnerability you owe me.

412
00:16:47,302 --> 00:16:48,336
Sit down.

413
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:50,287
Okay.

414
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:54,809
Okay, but I must warn you, as a
professional, I'm immune to...

415
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:55,776
Tell me about your mother.

416
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:57,924
Everything she says
is a manipulation!

417
00:16:57,963 --> 00:16:59,263
When I was
seven years old...

418
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,931
Mr. Cootes.

419
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,817
- Hey.
- Listen, I've been thinking

420
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:04,735
a lot about what you said
yesterday,

421
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,270
about how we're all gonna die.

422
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:07,571
Oh, I'm not gonna die.

423
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:10,691
I bought an old mine shaft
in Colorado.

424
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:13,728
I've spent the last six months
filling it with canned goods,

425
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,864
<i>assault rifles and all five
seasons of Friday Night Lights.</i>

426
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,750
Okay, first of all,
you can skip season two.

427
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:23,153
Second of all, after our talk...

428
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:26,741
I came pretty close
to giving up myself.

429
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:30,294
But then I went to the doctor
with my wife...

430
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,295
and...

431
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:34,932
I saw this.

432
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:39,370
Boy or girl?

433
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:41,505
I don't know.

434
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:44,275
But I know I sure as hell
can't give up now.

435
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,727
So, if you're just looking
for someone

436
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:49,113
to hold the other end
of the limbo stick,

437
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:52,199
you got the wrong guy for
the job, and you know why?

438
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,952
'Cause you're three feet taller
than everyone in this office?

439
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:57,955
No. Because if I am
gonna work here,

440
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:59,790
then first thing
tomorrow morning,

441
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,859
I'm walking down
to Gruber Pharmaceuticals,

442
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:03,828
and I'm rejecting their offer.

443
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,163
Even if I have to do it myself.

444
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:12,670
Listen, I want you
to know... I know.

445
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:13,671
Know what?

446
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:15,272
Nora.

447
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:16,674
Barney.

448
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:17,708
Nora.

449
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,209
Just say what you're gonna say!

450
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:20,594
I know you're old!

451
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:23,147
And I've been struggling
with it,

452
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:26,049
but when I look at you...

453
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:28,385
I don't care,
because I really like you.

454
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:33,557
And because for 37,
you are keeping it toit!

455
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,860
You think I'm 37?

456
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:37,812
Well, if you were really 29,

457
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:39,107
then you would have
been a little kid

458
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:41,999
the first time you saw the Ewoks
and you would have loved them.

459
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:43,464
<i>Barney, I didn't see
any of the Star Wars</i>

460
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,934
movies until last year.

461
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,874
You... you're 29!

462
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,076
You still have
one good year left.

463
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,262
- What?
- Nothing.

464
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,797
Mm...

465
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,466
But Naveen's the neurosurgeon,

466
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:00,584
so of course he gets
all the attention!

467
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:01,886
Oh, Naveen is so smart,

468
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:04,805
he operates on people's brains!

469
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,891
Well, guess what, Mom?!

470
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:09,610
I treat the human mind!

471
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:11,612
Our time is up.

472
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:14,698
I don't think
this is gonna work.

473
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,400
I scared you off, didn't I?

474
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:20,154
No, I mean, I don't think
I can be your therapist.

475
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:22,790
You're really cute.

476
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,476
<i>The next day,</i>

477
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:27,661
<i>Marshall returned to
Gruber Pharmaceuticals alone.</i>

478
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:30,781
I mean, you admit
that you polluted the lake.

479
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:31,949
We got the evidence.

480
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,951
We got the charts.

481
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:36,137
The fish...

482
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:39,673
Fish, huh?

483
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,559
Fish are weird.

484
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:44,195
You ever think
about the names of fish?

485
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:45,679
I mean, come on.

486
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:46,964
Carp.

487
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:49,900
Garrison, what a nice surprise.

488
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,403
Your star apprentice
was just, uh...

489
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:54,071
"Floundering."

490
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,073
Little, little
fish humor

491
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,408
for you guys.

492
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,742
It was not going well.

493
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:01,445
I'm here to turn
down the 24,000.

494
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:05,332
Well, I can maybe get you
24,500.

495
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:10,871
Not... good... enough.

496
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,160
Where are we going?

497
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:19,430
To war, son.

498
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:22,216
We're going to war.

499
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:26,387
We're going to save the planet.

500
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:31,475
<i>And kids, as we now know,
they did.</i>

501
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:35,831
Hey, you know
what was on last night?

502
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,203
<i>- Stand and Deliver.
- Mm.</i>

503
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,428
- So good.
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:41,403
Whatever happened
to Jacob James Olmos?

505
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:42,604
Who?

506
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:45,574
Jacob James Olmos.
Whatever happened to that guy?

507
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,275
He never existed.

508
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:48,543
It's Edward James Olmos.

509
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:50,245
You're Olmos correct.

510
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,614
It's Jacob James Olmos.

511
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,666
- It's Edward James Olmos.
- Jacob James Olmos.

512
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:56,337
Edward James Olmos.

513
00:20:56,362 --> 00:20:57,379
- You're joking, right...?
- Are you serious...?

514
00:20:57,404 --> 00:20:59,165
- Seriously.
- Jacob James Olmos.
