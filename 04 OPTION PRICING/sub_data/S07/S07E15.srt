1
00:00:01,688 --> 00:00:04,742
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Is it about the bees?

2
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:06,712
Bees?
We're throwing

3
00:00:06,714 --> 00:00:08,392
a housewarming party
in two weeks.

4
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:09,215
Oh.

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,632
It's gonna be friends,
neighbors...

6
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:12,134
Did he say...
did he say "bees"?

7
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:15,554
Yeah. Marshall's been working
very long hours lately,

8
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:18,590
so I have been planning
this whole party by myself,

9
00:00:18,592 --> 00:00:21,443
and everything's in place:
the food, the wine.

10
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:24,596
I even found a rare
Gouda on the Internet.

11
00:00:24,598 --> 00:00:25,781
Oh.

12
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:26,982
Getting back
to these bees...

13
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:29,034
Bottom line: this party
is very important to me,

14
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:33,538
so I can only assume--
and I say this with love--

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,940
you're gonna ruin it.

16
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:37,859
Lily, I promise I won't ruin
your party.

17
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:39,611
I'll be charming and convivial.

18
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:40,963
A regular Burt Reynolds.

19
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:42,664
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

20
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,766
Tell us about the bees!

21
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,969
Well, all right,
since you asked.

22
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:48,303
I'm starting up a business

23
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:51,006
cultivating all-organic,
artisanal honey.

24
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,809
That's right,
I'm a job creator.

25
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,144
Oh.
So this party...

26
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:57,980
Oh, Lily, wait.
Um, if you don't mind,

27
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:00,432
I just,
I have one follow-up.

28
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:03,235
Where are you doing
this exactly?

29
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:06,154
Downstairs-- there's 10,000 bees
in the basement.

30
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,499
Why would you even say
that?! It's the most ridic...

31
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,501
Happy housewarming!

32
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:27,286
Hey, guys.

33
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,453
Robin here has spent

34
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,556
all day learning
how to make kugel.

35
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,341
Couldn't figure it out--
this is from Zabar's.

36
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,009
Can we heat it up
in your oven?

37
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,679
Faster than heating it up
in the refrigerator.

38
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:38,814
I've had a few cocktails.

39
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,416
I got it.
Take that.

40
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,635
<i>Kids, someday
you're gonna throw a party,</i>

41
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,404
<i>and you might find yourself
worrying</i>

42
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,189
<i>if something's gonna go wrong.</i>

43
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,141
<i>Well, don't.</i>

44
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:52,778
<i>What you should worry about
is everything going wrong.</i>

45
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,615
<i>And what's really scary
is how quickly that can happen.</i>

46
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,417
<i>At Lily and Marshall's
housewarming party</i>

47
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:01,954
<i>for instance,
it only took five minutes.</i>

48
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:05,107
<i>Now, a lot happened
in those five minutes.</i>

49
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,094
<i>You know what? I'm gonna take
this room by room.</i>

50
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,163
<i>We'll start in the living room.</i>

51
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:15,801
Oh, no,
that's not what you want.

52
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,970
- What?
- Oh, nothing. So, you think

53
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,138
this is going pretty well?

54
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,439
Baby, are you kidding?

55
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,674
You single-handedly pulled off
the party of the year.

56
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,394
Oh, stop it.
I used both hands.

57
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,845
So, what can I do to help?

58
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,865
Honey, this is your first night
off in however long.

59
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:32,735
You just relax and keep knocking
back those cocktails.

60
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,236
Mr. Cootes.

61
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,289
Hey, isn't it nice
to finally have a night off?

62
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,408
<i>It is.
But tonight is not that night.</i>

63
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,526
We're going back to the office
in 45 minutes.

64
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,527
But, sir, this is
our housewarming party.

65
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,031
You know,
Mother Earth is also having

66
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,417
a "housewarming" party, too,

67
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,421
only hers ends with humankind
at the bottom of a rising ocean,

68
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,257
passing through the digestive
tract of a stingray.

69
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,893
By the way,
it's a lovely home.

70
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:01,930
Mr. Cootes,
I know you're a vegan, so I, uh,

71
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,267
I got some vegan spring rolls
for you over there.

72
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,403
Oh, nummies!

73
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,272
You're going
back to work?

74
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,158
Sheez, Marshall,
you are as busy as a...

75
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,745
Oh, gosh,
what are you as busy as?

76
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:17,946
Please don't talk about
the bees.

77
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,331
I was gonna say Nicolas Cage.

78
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,617
That guy is in everything.

79
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,735
Let's just put on some music.

80
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,840
â™ª

81
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,675
I'll, uh, I'll bring out
the Gouda,

82
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,077
we'll open a couple bottles
of wine...

83
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,545
that are in the basement.

84
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,564
All right, I'll get
my beekeeper's suit.

85
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,216
You should be happy
about the bees.

86
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,750
They're keeping
the mice at bay.

87
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,751
We have mice?

88
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,270
Not with all these bees

89
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:42,521
flying around, we don't.

90
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,473
You're welcome.

91
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,976
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out. Look alive.

92
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,732
Are you a vegan?

93
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,150
What?

94
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,652
Ooh-ee!

95
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:59,405
Kitchen, now.

96
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,658
I can't believe that he's
making us go to work tonight.

97
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,295
Are... you... a... vegan?

98
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,247
Um, no.

99
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,749
Uh-huh.
And when you were shoveling

100
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,669
the spring rolls down your
gullet, did you happen to notice

101
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,305
a little sign next
to the plate marked "Vegan"?

102
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:17,956
I think there's
been some mistake.

103
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,126
You could have had anything
on that table!

104
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,845
Anything at all!

105
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,398
Mini pizzas,
bacon-wrapped figs,

106
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,766
pigs in blankets.

107
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,651
There was even talk
of an inbound Gouda!

108
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,271
But no, no, you had to have
the one thing

109
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,940
that someone with my dietary
preferences can eat.

110
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,942
Look, I didn't eat
the spring rolls.

111
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,777
Liar!

112
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,797
Your breath reeks of shredded
carrots and deceit!

113
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:48,487
Okay, okay, maybe I did eat
your precious spring rolls.

114
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,588
Oh...

115
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,157
<i>What are you gonna do
about it, hippie?</i>

116
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,012
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

117
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:59,465
Young man,

118
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,551
are you suggesting
fisticuffs...

119
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,669
as in with our fists?

120
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,356
And feet--
I'm a kicker.

121
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:10,609
Well, well, looks like
I just started eating

122
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,478
white meat again.

123
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,982
I will bite and scratch
you like a wolverine.

124
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,017
May I warn you,

125
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,287
I have been in
a fight before.

126
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,540
So have I... sort of.

127
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,708
Oh, God.

128
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,828
Mr. Cootes. Hi.

129
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,531
Did you see that we had
hummus and veggies?

130
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,633
There's hummus and veggies?

131
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,867
Over there.

132
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,370
Hey, I'm not gonna let that guy
push me around.

133
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,757
I believe it was Sun Tzu
who wrote, "Never give up.

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,724
Never surrender."

135
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,259
Shut up, Ted.
Okay.

136
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:49,231
For God's sake, Lily,
you're pregnant.

137
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:53,235
For God's sake, Ted,
Lily's pregnant.

138
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,506
Oh, man.

139
00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:59,224
Sorry about that.

140
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,076
I don't need
this right now, Ted.

141
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:02,995
I shouldn't do this.

142
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:04,229
- I shouldn't do this.
- What?

143
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,416
This is a bad idea.
This is a bad idea!

144
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:10,252
- What is?
- I should just go. I should just go!

145
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,955
Okay, okay, just tell me
what is going on.

146
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,541
I love my penis, Robin.

147
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,843
Oh, Barney, you promised.

148
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,345
I do! I love it!

149
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,548
If I could kiss it, I would.

150
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,267
I'd be lying if I told you
I hadn't tried.

151
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,436
I'm not comfortable
with this conversation.

152
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:31,256
Oh, come on, Robin, it's my
penis we're talking about.

153
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,475
- You've seen her-- she's magnificent.
- She?

154
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,445
Every penis is a girl, Robin.
Everyone knows that.

155
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:41,533
Like... ships and lake monsters.

156
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,602
And Gouda!

157
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,287
She's a beauta.

158
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,538
Oh, Gouda.

159
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,773
Well, I'll be back.

160
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,775
Most of me, anyway.

161
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,245
- Don't eat that.
- What?

162
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,247
Whoops! Oh, it's ruined.

163
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,666
It's not ruined.
Ten second rule.

164
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,552
Eight, nine, ten,
and it's ruined.

165
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,471
This whole party's
ruined.

166
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:05,457
I got a basement
full of bees,

167
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,809
and Ted almost got into a fight
with Mr. Cootes.

168
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,478
Lily, look around.

169
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,129
Everyone's having
an amazing time.

170
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,331
It's a great party.

171
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,151
Okay, maybe it's not
a total disaster.

172
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,841
What the hell was that?!

173
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,043
<i>So that's what happened
in the living room.</i>

174
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:36,423
<i>Now I'm gonna tell you what
happened in the dining room.</i>

175
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,837
Oh, no, that's not
what you want.

176
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,742
Man, I can't believe
these are vegan.

177
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:44,976
I've had, like, 20 of 'em.

178
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:47,228
I should get the name
of this caterer.

179
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,698
It's my kitten's
Bat Mitzvah next week.

180
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,150
She's finally
becoming a cat.

181
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:54,185
Oh, God, you are crazy.

182
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:56,287
About cats.

183
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,857
Cats are so honest and real
with their affections.

184
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,076
Ever since my divorce,

185
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,877
it's just been one liar
after another.

186
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,197
That's why it's so refreshing
to meet someone honest like you,

187
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,033
Special Agent Gary Powers.

188
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,418
Listen...

189
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,089
I think we can agree
there's something here.

190
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,174
Something big...

191
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:20,178
that looks
and probably feels real.

192
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,564
Maybe...

193
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:24,265
we can go back
to your place.

194
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:27,218
I can't ask you to delay
intercepting those asteroids.

195
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,571
I do need to intercept
those asteroids.

196
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:31,439
I think we need
to have sex right now.

197
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:35,560
Meet me in the upstairs guest
bedroom in two minutes.

198
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:40,915
I'm just looking
for the vegan spring rolls.

199
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,283
Last one, sorry.

200
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:43,701
Two minutes.

201
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:46,121
How can they all be gone?
The party just started.

202
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:47,255
I know, right?

203
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:49,591
Let's just put on
some music.

204
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:51,909
â™ª

205
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,545
I'll, uh, I'll bring out
the Gouda,

206
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:55,746
we'll open a couple of bottles
of wine...

207
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,348
that are in the basement.

208
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,683
Some jerk was just here.

209
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:00,018
And he was all, like,

210
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,553
"I can't believe
these are vegan.

211
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:02,720
I've had, like, 20 of 'em."

212
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:05,940
Point me into the direction
of this scoundrel.

213
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:08,693
Um... it was
that guy.

214
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:11,546
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out. Look alive.

215
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:16,534
Lily, these spring rolls...
ooh-ee!

216
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:18,903
Kitchen, now.

217
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:22,040
I can't believe that he's
making us go to work tonight.

218
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:23,908
I mean, I think it's time
that somebody took him aside

219
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,077
and told him this is not
how you treat your staff.

220
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:29,330
Well, I'm sort of busy
with the party right now.

221
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:31,449
Fine. I'll do it myself.
But he's gonna scream at me,

222
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,134
and you know that I can't
stand up to screaming.

223
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:35,453
Just go talk to him!
I think I should go talk to him.

224
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:39,474
Barney...
Ah, Lily,

225
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:41,676
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

226
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:43,895
You could have had
anything on that table!

227
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:47,398
Mini pizzas,
bacon-wrapped figs,

228
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,433
pigs in blankets.

229
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:51,469
There was even talk
of an inbound Gouda!

230
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,471
Robin. Okay, listen,
I need your help.

231
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:55,607
I'm about to get in
a screaming match with my boss,

232
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,141
and I'm not good at getting
screamed at,

233
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:58,660
so I need you to warm me up.

234
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:00,445
How?
I want you to scream at me.

235
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:02,664
You know, like you do
to strangers on the street

236
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,082
at the slightest provocation.

237
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:05,450
I don't do that.

238
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:07,085
Come on, lay some of that
classic Scherbatsky

239
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:08,586
mean son of a bitch on me.

240
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:11,122
Treat me like I'm a Girl Scout
trying to sell you cookies.

241
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,208
Four dollars a box
and you're out of Thin Mints?!

242
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,628
You green little...!
I don't do that!

243
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,129
Come on, scream at me.

244
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,381
Like that.

245
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:21,599
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

246
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,935
Marshall, there is plenty
of stuff

247
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:25,887
that I don't get mad about,

248
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,172
like the fact that you're
serving pigs in blankets

249
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:30,007
without hot mustard.

250
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,977
I'm not the type of person
to be driven crazy by a host

251
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:35,363
who refuses to provide
delicious hot mustard

252
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:37,282
in which to dip
my pigs in blankets!

253
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,350
I'm the type of girl who...
keeps her cool.

254
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,319
Who keeps her cool.

255
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:45,356
Wait. Whoa, baby,
are you okay?

256
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,525
Of course.
This party is great.

257
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:51,012
I am handling this.
Oh, God.

258
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:55,416
No...

259
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:56,668
Hummus and veggies?

260
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,387
I'm looking for
hummus and veggies.

261
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:02,056
Robin, can I talk to you about
something very dear to me?

262
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:03,925
Promise me this isn't
about your penis.

263
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:06,327
I promise it isn't
about my penis.

264
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:07,812
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:13,001
Excuse me, sir, could I talk
to you in the kitchen?

266
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,491
Sorry about that.

267
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:22,110
I don't need this
right now, Ted.

268
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:24,529
I swear, if there's
one more crisis...

269
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:26,414
Well, the bees
escaped their enclosure,

270
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,117
but no reason
to "bee" concerned.

271
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,004
No, there is,
we're in big trouble.

272
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,622
What is that smell?

273
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,907
Oh, I doused my suit
with kerosene.

274
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,576
All beekeepers do this.

275
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:40,795
Dad, just take off
the suit right now.

276
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:41,596
All right, fine.

277
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:43,414
Every 30 seconds,

278
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,600
there's another crisis
that needs to be dealt with

279
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:47,268
and I have
to deal with it.

280
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,021
This is... Oh, God.

281
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:51,639
This is parenthood, isn't it?

282
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:52,890
So they say.

283
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:54,475
Okay, it's official.

284
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:56,861
I thought I could do it,
but I can't.

285
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,396
No, Marshall's always at work.

286
00:11:58,398 --> 00:11:59,864
He's got to go back tonight.

287
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,816
And I don't know
if I can handle a life

288
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:04,118
that's just one crisis
after another.

289
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,437
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna
give you a little piece of...

290
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:07,789
Gouda!

291
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,773
God.

292
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,625
Crisis?
Crisis.

293
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:14,128
- Don't eat that. Whoops!
- What?

294
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,463
Gouda's out, Ted.
Don't sleep on the Gouda.

295
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:16,664
Wouldn't dream of it.

296
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,449
So Lily told me you have to go
back to work tonight?

297
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,168
No, I don't have to go
back to work tonight.

298
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,586
Mr. Cootes and I
came to an understanding.

299
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:22,971
But, hey, what's going on
with Robin?

300
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:24,922
I called her
a mean son of a bitch

301
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:26,123
and she took it all weird.

302
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,759
- She did?
- Yeah.

303
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:28,943
Crazy, right?

304
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:30,678
Hey, buddy.

305
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,347
Best housewarming
party ever.

306
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:34,799
Everybody's abuzz.

307
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,300
Abuzz.

308
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:37,852
Oh, good one, Mickey.

309
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:39,153
But, hey, you're right.

310
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,139
Great party.

311
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:51,199
What the hell
was that?!

312
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,507
<i>And that's what happened
in the dining room.</i>

313
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:03,252
<i>Now I'm gonna tell you
what happened in the kitchen.</i>

314
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:07,064
Oh, no, that's not
what you want.

315
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,500
Man, I can't believe
these are vegan.

316
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:10,701
Back to our fight?

317
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,152
Back to our fight.

318
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:14,471
I cannot believe you screamed
at that woman at Zabar's.

319
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:15,839
She was trying to cut in line.

320
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:17,324
She was gonna get
the last kugel.

321
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:18,542
She was 90 years old.

322
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:20,678
It was probably gonna be
her last kugel.

323
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,513
Sometimes in life,
you have to be assertive

324
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:23,830
and stand up for yourself.

325
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:25,165
You called her a whore.

326
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,633
Who wears that much makeup?!

327
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:27,601
Old ladies!

328
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:29,720
Who take money for sex. Exactly.

329
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:32,106
Look, I'm sorry.

330
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:34,841
If I would've left things
in your dainty, lily-white,

331
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,727
never-ripped-
an-old-lady's-wig-off hands,

332
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:38,779
we would be kugel-free
right now.

333
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:40,447
Oh, so, what, I'm too nice?

334
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:42,032
You never stand up for yourself.

335
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:44,485
Remember that sixth grader
who kept stealing your lunch?

336
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:47,321
High school was
a tough time for me, okay?

337
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:48,906
And that girl was muscular.

338
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,574
Forearms like Popeye.

339
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,209
How do you even know about that?

340
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:54,495
Marshall told me.
He also said that

341
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:55,913
you had your mom stop making

342
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:57,464
peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches

343
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:59,199
because of that girl's
nut allergy.

344
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:00,918
I didn't want to add
to her health problems.

345
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,219
She was already in a wheelchair.

346
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,870
Okay, so what?

347
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:06,706
I would rather be nice
than be like you,

348
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,392
always getting in fights
about stuff

349
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:09,843
that's not even worth
fighting about.

350
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:11,044
Disagree.

351
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:13,564
<i>It's like Sun Tzu wrote
in The Art of War,</i>

352
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,599
"Never give up.
Never surrender."

353
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,401
<i>That was Tim Allen
in Galaxy Quest.</i>

354
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:18,552
Whatever, dude.

355
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:20,571
Your problem is any time
you're faced with

356
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,606
the least bit of confrontation,
you run away.

357
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:25,175
Oh, I run away
from confrontation?

358
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,365
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out.

359
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,716
Look alive.

360
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:35,753
Whoops.
Son of a...!

361
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,404
I'm sorry.

362
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:39,123
Maybe that was my fault.

363
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,290
You think?

364
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,675
You're right in my snack track.

365
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:44,128
Hey, nice
beekeeper suit.

366
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,247
Do you know that, uh,
most bees are left-handed?

367
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,716
Did you know bees hate
the smell of kerosene?

368
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,385
I knew that.
Geez, what do you think,

369
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:53,303
this is my first day
as a beekeeper?

370
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:55,973
Nice. Oh.

371
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:58,642
Is that true about
bees and kerosene?

372
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,260
I don't know.

373
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:01,645
Barney...

374
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:02,646
Ah, Lily,

375
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:04,815
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

376
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,650
Barney, that woman
you were talking to,

377
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:07,618
our neighbor Geraldine,

378
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,219
some guy
slept with her

379
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:12,322
and didn't call her,
so she hunted him down

380
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:17,127
and cut off a certain part of
his anatomy with a cheese knife.

381
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:19,580
So, whatever you do,

382
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:21,081
don't sleep with her.

383
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,918
It's funny, she is,
um, waiting for me

384
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,720
in the guest bedroom right now.

385
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:28,622
Oh, God! Oh, God!

386
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:31,141
That was the idea,
but now forget it!

387
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,426
Barney, this is a disaster.

388
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:34,812
I swear, if there
is one...

389
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,963
It's fine. Everything's fine.

390
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:38,482
Hey, ten second
rule, right?

391
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,936
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

392
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:45,439
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

393
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:47,991
I know you're pregnant, but
you need a glass of wine.

394
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:49,809
I got that cheese off
the Internet.

395
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:51,245
I know you got it
off the Internet.

396
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:52,579
Why does that
make it impressive?

397
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,665
You know what else you can find
on the Internet?

398
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,366
Zoo animals masturbating.

399
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:58,168
There's one of a walrus.

400
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,319
He's...

401
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:01,505
Oh.

402
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,552
No...

403
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:20,774
Excuse me, sir, could I talk
to you in the kitchen?

404
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:33,353
Mr. Cootes, I am not
going back to work tonight.

405
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:35,239
Oh, no, she didn't
just say that.

406
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,824
Mickey, could we just
have a minute?

407
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:40,244
Oh, yeah. Sure.

408
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:45,465
Marshall, look, I know
when you started with this firm,

409
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,167
it was all fun and games.

410
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:50,971
The office chair races
were particularly spirited.

411
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:54,308
Until, of course,
Gail went down the stairs.

412
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,976
But for one brief moment,

413
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:58,512
boy, did she fly.

414
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:02,599
I'm not here, I'm not here.

415
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,935
Mr. Cootes, you're working
yourself to death.

416
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:07,387
Just cut loose a little.

417
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:09,856
Have a beer, find a hobby.

418
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,742
Look, son, it's very simple.

419
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:14,561
Um, Mother Earth
doesn't get a night off.

420
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:15,779
Neither do you.

421
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,164
Well, then I quit.

422
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:23,503
And I don't know
if I can handle a life

423
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:25,422
that's just one crisis
after another.

424
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:27,708
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna
give you a little piece of...

425
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,042
Gouda!

426
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:30,010
Maybe he's right.

427
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:32,296
Maybe I do
need a hobby.

428
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,931
Well, hey,
how about beekeeping?

429
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:37,017
Me? No. I-I don't know the
first thing about bees.

430
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,303
You want to know a secret?

431
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:40,671
Neither do I.

432
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:43,023
It's not a secret.

433
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:45,058
Let me try this thing on.

434
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,443
I'm gonna give you
some privacy.

435
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:48,278
All right, thank you.

436
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,529
Okay.

437
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:50,981
Hey, buddy.

438
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:52,816
Best housewarming
party ever.

439
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:54,534
Everybody's abuzz.

440
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:59,623
Okay, maybe it's not
a total disaster.

441
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,791
Great party.

442
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,055
Oh, my God. Oh!

443
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,306
Oh, Mr. Cootes!

444
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:17,674
Mr. Cootes, are you okay?!

445
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:21,061
That was amazing!

446
00:18:21,063 --> 00:18:22,262
Did you see me?!

447
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:24,648
I flew through the air
like a human fireball

448
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,932
and didn't get a scratch.

449
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:27,484
Eat your heart out, Gail!

450
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,970
God, I feel so alive!

451
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:32,572
I want to drink a beer.

452
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:33,690
Oh, yeah.

453
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,242
Okay, one beer, coming right up.

454
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:37,995
Oh, and, uh, Marshall,

455
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:41,648
I think we'll take
the night off tonight, okay?

456
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,417
Sounds good, yeah.

457
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:45,535
But I'll see you Monday?

458
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:47,788
Of course.

459
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,789
Yeah.

460
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:54,127
You know, Robin, I've
been thinking about it.

461
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,763
Guess it's kind of nice
you're such a badass.

462
00:18:56,765 --> 00:19:00,434
It's pretty badass
you're so nice, Ted.

463
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:06,890
Was I supposed to close
the basement door?

464
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,655
God, this feels
so right!

465
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:22,073
We're so great together.

466
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:24,542
I want to spend every minute
of every day with you.

467
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:26,411
I never let you out of
my sight for one second.

468
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:28,079
Not one second, not
one second. I don't!

469
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,381
Oh, God!

470
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:31,582
My last lover was not like this.

471
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,084
He was the worst!

472
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:36,220
Do you know, he didn't even
come to my cat's bris.

473
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:37,839
I mean, what?

474
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:39,207
Well, we showed him.

475
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,425
Yes, we did.

476
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:43,544
Let's just say, the
punishment fit the crime.

477
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,012
I can't wait to
tell everybody

478
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:46,564
that we're boyfriend and girlfriend!

479
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:47,715
Let's do it tonight.

480
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,067
No, it's Lily and
Marshall's party.

481
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:50,384
We'll wait.

482
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:53,521
We can do it at Mittens
and Mr. Pepper's wedding.

483
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,055
Or maybe something...
