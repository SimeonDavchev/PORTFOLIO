1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,178
<i>Kids, in the spring of 2012,</i>

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,830
<i>your Uncle Barney went off
the grid for a couple weeks.</i>

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,506
<i>So I was relieved
when I got a text</i>

4
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:09,191
<i>asking me to come over
to his place.</i>

5
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:11,125
Glad to hear from you, buddy.

6
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:14,091
I was worried something
bad happened...

7
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:15,780
to you.

8
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:17,478
Welcome, brother.

9
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:18,582
What is this?

10
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,105
Ted Evelyn Mosby,

11
00:00:21,237 --> 00:00:23,668
you are about to be
sworn to secrecy

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,598
through the sacred vows
of a Bro Oath,

13
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:29,007
or "Broath."

14
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:33,277
Please, put on
your "brobe."

15
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:35,446
Yeah, I'm not putting on
the "brobe."

16
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:37,148
Ted, just...

17
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,600
just... Okay?

18
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:42,625
♪ Broooo... ♪

19
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:45,455
Wait, are they chanting "bro"?

20
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,754
♪ Bro... ♪

21
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:48,496
I got some local monks
to record this.

22
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:50,130
Yeah! I got a monk guy.

23
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:51,344
Cool, right?

24
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,634
It actually is, yeah.

25
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:53,697
I'll burn it for you.

26
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:54,988
Just remind me after The Broath.

27
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:58,215
Anyway, Ted Evelyn Mosby,

28
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:03,479
this ritual forever binds you
to keep a solemn secret...

29
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:04,792
Which is?

30
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,425
I really like this Quinn girl!

31
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:08,360
We've been spending
tons of time together,

32
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:09,838
and I want the gang to meet her.

33
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,629
But I'm afraid they're
gonna disapprove because,

34
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:15,126
<i>- well, you know.
- I did know. You see,</i>

35
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:17,121
<i>Quinn was a stripper...</i>

36
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:20,073
<i>who had swindled Barney out of
quite a bit of cash.</i>

37
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:21,878
We're inviting everyone
to dinner at Quinn's,

38
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:23,587
and I want them to
keep an open mind,

39
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:25,071
which brings us to The Broath.

40
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:28,042
Place your hand
on The Bro Code.

41
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:29,784
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

42
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,956
Repeat after me.

43
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:35,704
I, Ted Evelyn Mosby...

44
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:39,958
"I, Ted "Why Did I Ever Tell You
My Middle Name" Mosby..."

45
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:42,757
solemnly swear not to
tell our friends

46
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:44,156
that Quinn is a stripper.

47
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:46,103
"...solemnly swear not
to tell our friends

48
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:49,154
that Quinn is a stripper" who
duped you out of lots of money.

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,763
You're only supposed
to repeat after me.

50
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,307
"You're only supposed
to repeat after me."

51
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:53,277
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

52
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:55,433
Silence!

53
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:58,435
Look, I know that things
started out sketchy

54
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:00,771
with me and Quinn, but
I really like her, so please.

55
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:02,593
Do you,

56
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:06,944
Ted Middle-Name-Omitted Mosby,

57
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:10,197
swear to uphold this Broath?

58
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,416
I do.

59
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:15,452
Barney's dating a stripper
who's gonna steal all his money!

60
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,638
Okay, time to go to
Quinn's. Now remember,

61
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:31,846
I told you nothing, okay?

62
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,840
Barney really wants
us all to like her.

63
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:34,944
But how can we?

64
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,787
Quinn totally duped Barney,
and he couldn't even see it.

65
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:40,086
Well, apparently, the sex
is mind-blowing.

66
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:42,785
Ha, I've been there.
Yeah.

67
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,467
I was once with this chick

68
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:47,303
who answered the door wearing
nothing but, uh, whipped cream,

69
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:50,070
a dog collar
and a hot pink thong.

70
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,203
Marshall,

71
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:52,602
you can't tell sex stories

72
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:54,208
about "this chick," because

73
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,614
everyone knows it's me.

74
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:57,364
I'm the only woman
you've ever been with.

75
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:00,216
It's not fair, the guys are
always telling their sex stories

76
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:01,818
and I can top
every one of them.

77
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,021
Baby, you're like 20 slutty
chicks all rolled into one.

78
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:07,273
Sweet talk is not going
to change my mind.

79
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:09,558
Let's focus.

80
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,910
Tonight, we want to make sure

81
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:13,162
that Quinn is not
out to scam Barney.

82
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:15,248
So, when we walk back
through that door

83
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,617
three hours from now,
we should all be able

84
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,836
to answer one simple question:

85
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,006
Do we trust this girl?

86
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:25,208
Well, for one thing,

87
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,093
she seems kind of controlling.

88
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:30,246
Is it okay if I put out
the hummus, bunny face?

89
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:31,631
No, save it for dessert.

90
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:33,049
Idiot.

91
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,969
Uh, ah...

92
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,055
More red wine, beauty-swan?

93
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:41,590
She drinks a lot.

94
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:44,193
Is it okay if I
go pee, sugar lamb?

95
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:45,261
No!

96
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:46,929
You just went three hours ago.

97
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,898
You're right, baby bear!

98
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,071
Yes, so Barney's whipped;
It doesn't mean

99
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:57,156
that Quinn is a con artist.

100
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,608
Well, maybe we could've gotten
a better read on her

101
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,295
if two people
hadn't gone off topic.

102
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:04,831
By the way, Quinn,
your apartment is amazing.

103
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,448
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

104
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,718
I'm actually moving out soon.

105
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,503
If you know anyone
looking for a sublet,

106
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:11,471
this place is rent-controlled.

107
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:13,139
You would not believe
what I pay.

108
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:14,957
<i>Kids, things have been tense</i>

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,592
<i>between Robin and I for weeks.</i>

110
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:18,311
<i>Ever since she moved out,</i>

111
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:20,897
<i>and I gave the apartment
to Marshall and Lily,</i>

112
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,483
<i>I'd been crashing
in university housing.</i>

113
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:25,651
It's 10:00,
damn it.

114
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:27,136
Ned, Martin and Millie,

115
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:28,804
people are trying to sleep!

116
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:31,908
Hey, you were young
like us once, right?

117
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,278
I was never like you guys.

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,498
<i>And Robin was staying
with her coworker, Patrice.</i>

119
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,249
You seem so down today, Robin.

120
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:41,701
I made you cookies.

121
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:44,320
Damn it, Patrice,
stop smothering me!

122
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,007
<i>So, when Quinn said
her apartment was available...</i>

123
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,294
It's mine! It's mine! It's mine!

124
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:52,428
Dibs! Dibs! Dibs!

125
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,431
We got off topic?
What about Marshall?

126
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,133
Hey, I was just
going along with

127
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:59,352
whoever suggested
we play that game.

128
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:00,636
Hey, let's play a game!

129
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:03,222
Uh, craziest
sex-in-public story; I'll start.

130
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:05,024
I was once with this chick

131
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:07,443
who loved to get freaky
in elevators.

132
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:08,844
Doors would close;
Suddenly,

133
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:12,064
she's panting on all fours
like a dog in heat.

134
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:16,152
Marshall, stop.

135
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:17,737
I never said that it was you.

136
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,739
Okay, so anyway, last August,

137
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,958
I go bareback
with this same slut.

138
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,911
She get's pregnant;
Bitch is even hornier.

139
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,696
Oh, yeah? I was once
with this dude

140
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:29,832
who I caught eating
a sandwich during sex.

141
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,300
Big ol' meatball

142
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:33,302
falls out, lands on my back,

143
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,537
rolls on to the elevator floor.

144
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,706
Hmm. Disgusting, right?

145
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:41,477
What, I never said it was you.

146
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,680
Yeah, sorry we didn't stay
as laser-focused as you guys.

147
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:47,049
Hey, at least I got
some evidence.

148
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,652
Look what I found
in Quinn's bedroom.

149
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,571
Barney's taking her to Hawaii.

150
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:53,489
Lily, you snooped
through her stuff?

151
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:55,775
No. It's like
the first thing you see

152
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:58,494
when you jimmy open her desk
drawer with a letter opener

153
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:01,230
her grandfather left her,
according to her diary.

154
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:02,665
First-class tickets,

155
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,034
a four-star hotel--
this cost Barney a fortune.

156
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:08,737
Yeah, this proves that Quinn is
totally using him for his money.

157
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,239
You know what Lily, enough.

158
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:12,741
Guys, even if you're right
about Quinn, this is Barney.

159
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:13,876
He'll come to his senses.

160
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:16,379
I give this whole thing
a week, two weeks, tops.

161
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:18,764
And now, we have
an announcement.

162
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:19,548
Can I tell them?

163
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,217
No.

164
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:22,385
We're moving in together
We're m...

165
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:26,105
Congrats! That's great.
So happy for you.

166
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,756
We gotta end this.

167
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:29,792
Yup.

168
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,491
<i>Kids, as you'll recall,</i>

169
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:37,348
<i>our gang had a subtle way
of letting someone know</i>

170
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,133
<i>they were making a mistake.</i>

171
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:42,183
Where have you been?

172
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,247
Oh, worth it. Hang on.

173
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,058
Hey.

174
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:55,053
You know we would've
hated ourselves, right?

175
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:58,153
So,

176
00:06:58,153 --> 00:07:01,121
did Robin tell you the incredibly
devious thing she did today?

177
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,379
Me?!

178
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,760
Hey, so I just happened
to be in the neighborhood

179
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:08,502
and I thought, "Man, Quinn
is in such great shape,

180
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:10,368
she must love fruit."

181
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:12,910
So, unrelated,

182
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,660
how's the search for
a sub-letter going?

183
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:18,321
This is such a
weird coincidence!

184
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,704
Robin also "just happened"
to be in the neighborhood

185
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:24,187
with a bottle of wine
and her credit scores.

186
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,307
I can't believe you two.

187
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,609
What do you care about more,
protecting your friend

188
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:37,395
from getting hurt or scoring
this girl's apartment?

189
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:38,980
There's a working fireplace!

190
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,733
Patrice is ironing
my pants all wrong!

191
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:43,568
You guys should be ashamed.

192
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,370
Speaking of shame,

193
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:47,939
I was once with this chick
who liked to do hand stuff

194
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:49,657
underneath a jacket
while we were all

195
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,459
sitting around our
favorite booth at MacLaren's.

196
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:52,627
Gross.

197
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:54,462
We share appetizers.

198
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:57,215
Okay, well, I was once
with a dude

199
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:59,784
who couldn't even fantasize
about a three-way.

200
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:02,087
He was all,
"Ew, she's your best friend."

201
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,054
What now?

202
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:04,472
I was once with a
chick who wanted

203
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:07,559
<i>to get it on during a school
production of Peter Pan.</i>

204
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:09,611
Well, I...
Wait, that wasn't me.

205
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,724
So, back to Patrice
and this ironing issue...

206
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,425
I thought I was the first girl
you ever did anything with.

207
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:16,892
Anything serious.

208
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,642
Please don't tell me that
you're jealous of me getting

209
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:21,776
to second base in tenth grade
with Jenna Cristalli.

210
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,086
Don't say that whore's name
in front of our baby.

211
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,424
What's going on?

212
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:31,185
Barney, this in an intervention.

213
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,973
A "Quinntervention."

214
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:39,004
You and Quinn are moving really
fast, and we don't trust her.

215
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:41,171
We're just looking out
for your best interests.

216
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,490
"Quinn-terests."

217
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:48,865
I don't understand. Wh...

218
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:50,734
Wait a sec.

219
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:53,249
Ted Evelyn Mosby...

220
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:55,890
you broke The Broath.

221
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:57,475
How dare you?!

222
00:08:57,477 --> 00:09:01,813
A Broath is the most sacred bond
between-- okay, yeah, I did.

223
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:04,682
Are you aware that
breaking a Broath

224
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:08,486
can have deadly,
even fatal repercussions?

225
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:10,522
Have you studied history, Ted?

226
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:12,190
Extensively.
But I'm a little shaky

227
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:13,524
on fake history, so...

228
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:15,406
The tragic cost of
a broken Broath

229
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:16,045
Uh-huh.

230
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:19,881
Dates back to
Ancient Bro-man times...

231
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:23,802
Hey, Bro-tus,

232
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:26,221
you'd tell me if,
like, a bunch of dudes

233
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:28,640
were conspiring to
assassinate me, right?

234
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:32,060
Um, totally, Caesar.

235
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:34,479
Paranoid much?

236
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:36,714
Just to be sure,

237
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:39,067
can you swear a Broath to me?

238
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:41,352
Sure. I swear.

239
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:43,721
Thanks.

240
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:45,940
You've always got my back.

241
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:09,547
<i>Et tu, Bro-te?</i>

242
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:16,437
And then he banged,
like, a hundred chicks

243
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:18,606
and invented a salad.

244
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:20,091
True story.

245
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:23,194
Well, Quinn lied to you;
She manipulated you.

246
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:24,863
What if she's just using you?

247
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,281
She's not just using me.

248
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:28,099
What about the expensive
trip to Hawaii?

249
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:30,702
What expensive trip to Hawaii?

250
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:33,037
The one I got for you.

251
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:36,124
That was supposed to be
a surprise for Barney.

252
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:38,576
He asked me to meet him here.

253
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,945
What's going on, you guys?

254
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,797
Tell her.

255
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:46,117
Fine, I'll fill her in.

256
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:48,253
And I am so angry,

257
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:51,422
I'm not even gonna make a joke
about "filling her in."

258
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:53,808
Which I did three times
last night, self-five.

259
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,477
My friends think
you're wrong for me,

260
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:58,429
so they're having
an intervention.

261
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,434
A "Quinntervention."

262
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:04,761
I don't understand.

263
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:07,209
Well, see, your name
is Quinn, and so...

264
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,876
I'll explain.

265
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:13,745
I made Ted promise not to tell
them what you do, but he did,

266
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:15,446
and now they don't trust you.

267
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:18,950
Wow, that really hurts.

268
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:20,134
But what's even worse

269
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:23,321
is that you felt
the need to lie about me.

270
00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:25,623
I'm not ashamed of
who I am, Barney,

271
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,658
but you clearly are.

272
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,843
I'm not ashamed of you.

273
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:31,095
I just didn't want them
to judge you without...

274
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,931
Maybe we are moving too fast.

275
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,999
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

276
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,968
I don't think I can do this.

277
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,355
Wait, are you ending things
just like that?

278
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:43,641
If you walk out that door,
you prove them right.

279
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:45,526
You prove that you're just
some heartless stripper

280
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:47,795
who never gave a damn about me
in the...

281
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:52,350
Don't call me.

282
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:58,366
Wow. That
was intense.

283
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:09,066
We just destroyed
what could have been

284
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:11,760
a once-in-a-lifetime shot
at happiness.

285
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,060
I know. I feel guilty, too.

286
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:16,757
Fireplace, balcony,

287
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:18,291
hardwood floors...

288
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,010
Okay, I'll just say it:

289
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:21,829
After everything that
happened between us,

290
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:22,880
I can't believe you wouldn't

291
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:25,332
back down and let me
have Quinn's place.

292
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:28,068
Ted, can I talk to you
out in the hall?

293
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,383
Has it ever occurred to you

294
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,334
that the last few weeks haven't
been easy for me either?

295
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:38,963
In the span of one day,
my engagement fell apart,

296
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:41,847
I lost my best friend,
then I lost my apartment.

297
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:44,147
And-and now I'm about
to lose my job.

298
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,175
What do you mean?

299
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:49,014
I-I've been completely
distracted at work.

300
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:52,045
And now my boss wants to see me
Friday at 5:00,

301
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:55,743
which, around the office,
is known as "fire o'clock."

302
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,849
I had no idea.

303
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:59,117
How could you?

304
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:02,437
The one person I want to talk
to most barely looks me

305
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:05,040
in the eye anymore,
much less returns my calls.

306
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:08,493
Ted, I know it took guts
to tell me you love me.

307
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:12,313
And I-I know how much it hurt
that I didn't say it back,

308
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:13,915
but...

309
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:17,852
Damn it, th-this sucks
for me, too.

310
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:20,588
And I-I miss you.

311
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,995
Is there any way we can just...
go back to normal?

312
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:32,434
I don't think
I can do normal anymore.

313
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:37,806
Barney still isn't answering.

314
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:40,675
We gotta go find him
and apologize.

315
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:46,865
Oh. I thought you were Quinn.

316
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,117
Barney, we're so sorry.

317
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,185
We never should've
meddled like that.

318
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:52,954
Can you forgive us?
I don't know.

319
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,739
You had no right to do that.

320
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:56,541
How can we make it
up to you, buddy?

321
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:02,330
I, one of Barney's
best friends...

322
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:05,166
"I, one of Barney's
best friends..."

323
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:08,920
promise never to interfere
with his personal life again...

324
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:13,158
"...promise never to interfere
with his personal life again..."

325
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,761
unless it's an issue of
health, national security,

326
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:18,563
or he's about to get up
on a fattie.

327
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:23,050
"...unless it's an issue of
health, national security,

328
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:26,053
or he's about to
get up on a fattie."

329
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:30,442
And now, to seal
this sacred vow,

330
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:32,243
the two ladies will kiss.
Barney...

331
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:35,062
The two ladies will kiss!

332
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:40,335
Mmm.

333
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,904
Lil...

334
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,456
Okay.

335
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,740
And now the gentlemen.

336
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:47,008
Dude...

337
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,377
And now the gentlemen!

338
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,765
Let's just...
This is silly.

339
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:58,019
Don't-don't touch
my face.

340
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,924
I was going to say,

341
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:04,592
"And now the gentlemen
bump fists."

342
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,394
How long you been holding
back that one?

343
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:09,647
Hot stuff, fellas.

344
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,683
Did I see a little tongue
in there?

345
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:14,285
I don't understand.

346
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:15,537
Well, if these two

347
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,622
will keep their sweaty paws
off each other

348
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:18,873
for half a second, I'll explain.

349
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,775
It all started
a couple days ago...

350
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,443
I want you to meet my friends.

351
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,045
Should I be nervous?

352
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,964
Is it like bringing me home
to meet your parents?

353
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,081
No, no, no.

354
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,616
Much more stressful than that.

355
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:31,052
You see, my friends, while
awesome, can be presumptuous,

356
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:33,388
meddlesome and
downright destructive.

357
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,807
When they learn what
you do and how we met,

358
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,258
they'll probably try
to break us up.

359
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,477
So let's have
some fun with them.

360
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,962
Mess with their heads.

361
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:44,098
Are you saying...
evil plan?

362
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,733
Hells to the yes.

363
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:47,936
My God, you're hot.

364
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:48,970
Wait for it.

365
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:50,655
Here's what we do.

366
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:53,992
<i>I'll make Ted swear not to tell
anyone what he knows about you,</i>

367
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,643
<i>and he'll cave immediately.</i>

368
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:57,729
Barney's dating a stripper
who's gonna steal all his money!

369
00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:59,731
<i>Next, we invite everyone over.</i>

370
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,333
Is it okay if I put out
the hummus, bunny face?

371
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,835
<i>- And I'll be the bossy-</i>

372
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,371
No, save it for dessert, idiot.

373
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:07,655
<i>Nice.</i>

374
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:09,040
<i>And, finally, we'll announce...</i>

375
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,608
We're moving in together!

376
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,960
I've got an idea.

377
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:13,628
Let's get your friends
Ted and Robin

378
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,929
fighting over my apartment.

379
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,998
Wait, what does that have
to do with you and me?

380
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,516
Nothing. I just
worship chaos.

381
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:20,351
I can't handle how hot
you are right now.

382
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,554
Wait for it.
Next,

383
00:16:22,556 --> 00:16:25,223
<i>they'll try to talk me
into dumping you.</i>

384
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:26,507
<i>And I'll walk in on it.</i>

385
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:27,442
<i>Then we pretend to break up.</i>

386
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,060
<i>And when they crawl back,</i>

387
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,428
<i>begging for forgiveness...</i>

388
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,564
<i>I'll be the bigger man
and let them off the hook.</i>

389
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:35,033
<i>Or make the monkeys
dance for you.</i>

390
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,985
<i>God, you're smart!</i>

391
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:39,454
It's gonna be legen...

392
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm not waiting for
it anymore. Mmm...

393
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:44,392
dary.

394
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:48,029
My God, you two are...

395
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:49,547
Perfect together.

396
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,499
So you're not really moving in?

397
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,051
Well, it started out as a joke,

398
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,836
but the more we
talked about it...

399
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:56,387
The more excited we got.

400
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,706
So, yeah, we are.

401
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,809
You have anything
to say about that?

402
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,729
So happy for you.
Congratulations.

403
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:07,815
Thank you.

404
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,317
Thank you.

405
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:12,186
You two realize this means

406
00:17:12,188 --> 00:17:14,505
my apartment really is
up for grabs, right?

407
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:17,859
I'm sure I'll find
something else.

408
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,527
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

409
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:23,164
<i>And that's the story
of how we met Quinn.</i>

410
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:27,168
<i>That Friday, I met Robin to see
how it went at "fire o'clock."</i>

411
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,404
They promoted me
to on-air talent.

412
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,406
I'm gonna be
Sandy Rivers' new co-host.

413
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:33,741
Oh, my God!

414
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:34,909
How'd that happen?

415
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:35,960
Remember New Year's Eve?

416
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:38,412
<i>When I filled in for Sandy,
it turns out</i>

417
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:40,748
<i>the C.E.O.
of World Wide News liked me.</i>

418
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,249
He said I have "moxie."

419
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:44,052
So he's a 1940s gangster?

420
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:45,419
Apparently.

421
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:48,255
And I got a big raise,

422
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:51,693
so I'm taking this apartment
on Central Park West,

423
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,777
which means...

424
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,145
Quinn's apartment.

425
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:55,546
I already told her
you'd take it.

426
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:59,117
Wow. Thanks.

427
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,118
Yeah.

428
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,435
Hey, and congrats.

429
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:03,187
You deserve it all.

430
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:08,776
You know, I've been
thinking about it, and...

431
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:10,294
I can do normal.

432
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:12,330
To back to normal.

433
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,164
To back to normal.

434
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,126
Uh... I-I should get going.
Yeah.

435
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:26,561
You've got a lot to do.
Totally.

436
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,962
So...
Um, see you soon.

437
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:28,796
See you soon.

438
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:30,297
Yeah.

439
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,600
<i>We wouldn't see each other
for a long time.</i>

440
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:35,636
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

441
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:37,438
Listen, um...

442
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,141
about me getting to second base
in tenth grade

443
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:41,475
with Jenna Cristalli...

444
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:42,994
I don't know what you're
talking about.

445
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,496
I've already forgotten
about that dumb hobag.

446
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:49,316
<i>Yeah, um, it didn't happen while
we were watching Peter Pan.</i>

447
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:53,320
It happened while I was
playing Peter Pan.

448
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:56,591
Here's a photo
from the day I was cast.

449
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,826
That's me in the middle.

450
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:00,828
But then I had my growth spurt.

451
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,182
By opening night, I was too big
for the flying harness,

452
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,350
and, well...

453
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,807
I fell hands-first
right onto Jenna Cristalli.

454
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:15,893
The tissues in her bra saved me
two broken wrists.

455
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:17,311
I'm sorry. I just, I just wanted

456
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:19,781
to have one cool
sex story that wasn't you.

457
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,067
Okay. Next time you tell it,
you were in your dad's car,

458
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:26,204
which you stole to go
to a Metallica concert,

459
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:30,374
and you got to third base
with that slut.

460
00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:34,996
I was once with this chick...

461
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:38,783
who is just the best wife ever.

462
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:44,555
Thank you for being so cool
about what I do.

463
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,591
A lot of guys would be
weird or jealous.

464
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:47,725
Are you kidding?

465
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,044
Who am I to judge
anyone? I'm the devil!

466
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,566
I mean, if you ever

467
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,551
wanted to stop stripping,
I'd support it.

468
00:19:57,553 --> 00:20:00,021
- If you wanted... to.
- Uh-huh.

469
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:02,156
So, you are jealous?

470
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,242
What? No, no, not at all.

471
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,244
I'm just saying,
if you ever wanted to hang up

472
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,946
the ol' G-string,
I'd completely understand.

473
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:11,833
Nah, I like taking my clothes
off for money.

474
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,867
Great.

475
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:15,286
Let me... let me finish.

476
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:19,907
Hypothetically,
what would make you stop?

477
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:22,176
Hypothetically...

478
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:27,248
I would stop stripping
if I ever got married.

479
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,516
Good night.

480
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:38,161
And then we agreed
to "go back to normal."

481
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:45,211
But I'm starting to wonder if we
can ever really just be friends.

482
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:50,633
Anyway, that's the story of me
and Robin, 2005 to the present.

483
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:51,968
What do you think?

484
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,087
I think your stories
are way too long.

485
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:58,524
I feel bad
for his future kids, dude.

486
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:03,529
Hey, my kids are gonna
love my stories.

487
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:07,450
They're gonna... yeah, they're
gonna love my stories.
