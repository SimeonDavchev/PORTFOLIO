1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:04,442
OLDER TED: Kids,
back in 2009,
your Aunt Robin

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,835
was the host
of a morning show
for local New York cable.

3
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:09,137
And it was on pretty early.
How early?

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,510
(LOUD SNORING)

5
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,348
ROBIN: Mike? Wake up.

6
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,053
(GRUNTING)

7
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:15,775
OLDER TED: But then,
everything changed.
Coming up next...

8
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,089
Hey.
Hey.

9
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,221
See my show?

10
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:19,916
Aw, I meant to watch it.

11
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,817
I just got
so busy with the whole
being-sound-asleep thing.

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,790
It took all night,
eight hours down
the drain.

13
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:29,258
It's fine.
But get this.
After the broadcast...

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,200
Hi. Are you Robin?
Yeah.

15
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,996
I'm Don,
your new co-host.

16
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:37,708
OLDER TED: Don was Don Frank,
a seasoned veteran of no fewer

17
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,571
than 38 local
morning news teams
from all over the country.

18
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,381
The guy was
an industry legend.

19
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,047
Oh!

20
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,917
Wow! You are so
going to hit that.

21
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,292
No! I just
think we're going to be
great together on the air.

22
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,923
And on the sofa and on the
bed and on the coffee table.

23
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,718
All right, all right.

24
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,930
I'm gonna go up on the roof
and stand there by myself
for five minutes.

25
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,932
Have fun.

26
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:05,534
OLDER TED: And that's
exactly what she did.
She just stood there.

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,699
All right, kids,
I'm gonna level with you.

28
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,668
That's not
what she did.
Here's what she did.

29
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,367
All right, all right.

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,009
(GRUNTING) I'm going
to go have a cigarette.

31
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,313
What?
What?

32
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,075
OLDER TED:
I promised her
I'd never tell you this,

33
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:20,475
but once upon a time, your
Aunt Robin did enjoy the
occasional cigarette,

34
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:25,288
and occasionally that
occasional cigarette was
more than just occasional.

35
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,256
I just left something
like this in my apartment.

36
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,525
Robin, come on,
take it to the roof.

37
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,164
We said
no smoking in
the apartment

38
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,369
after you torched the
throw rug doing push-ups.

39
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,001
All right,
all right,
all right.

40
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:43,897
Yeah, Robin. I mean, God,
not only is that
a filthy habit,

41
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,141
but also,
can I bum one?

42
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:46,606
Sure.

43
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,714
What?
What?

44
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,985
OLDER TED: Kids, your
Uncle Marshall definitely
doesn't want you to know this,

45
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,857
but he also
smoked off and on.

46
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,956
It all started
when he was 13,

47
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,558
on a camping
trip in Minnesota.

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,030
Come on,
Marshall, let's celebrate.

49
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,228
It's summer vacation.

50
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,671
Okay, but just one.

51
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,267
This is my first
and last cigarette ever.

52
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,580
OLDER TED: And that
was the first of many,
many last cigarettes ever.

53
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,283
That's it.
I am done, I am out.

54
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:29,647
Last... Cigarette... Ev-arr!

55
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,417
OLDER TED:
So, by that point,
I'd heard it all before.

56
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,515
Last cigarette ever.

57
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,487
What are you doing?
You haven't smoked
in six months.

58
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,127
Is this about the McRib?
It's gone, dude. Let it go.

59
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,363
I'm worried about work, okay?

60
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,629
They just hired a new
head of the legal department,

61
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,867
and he's going to
be letting people go.

62
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,033
So that's why
you're worried?

63
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,210
The new head of the legal
department is Arthur Hobbs.

64
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,912
As in Artillery Arthur?
As in your former boss?

65
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,835
OLDER TED:
Arthur Hobbs was
the meanest boss

66
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,210
Marshall or anyone
else had ever had.

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,080
The last time
Marshall worked for
him, it ended like this.

68
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,489
I quit!

69
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,922
Yikes. So, does he
hold it against you?

70
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,557
Worse.

71
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,662
I'm sorry,
who are you?

72
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,531
I'm Marshall Eriksen.

73
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:17,202
Um, we had a fairly
intense screaming match.

74
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,625
No.

75
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,199
Wherein I suggested
that you take your head

76
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,739
and store it
within yourself

77
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,865
in a fashion that,
well, while space-saving

78
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,440
might limit its
exposure to sunshine.

79
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,380
Well, that describes
95% of my employees

80
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,316
and everyone in my family,
except for my dog.

81
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,720
He's such a good boy.

82
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,330
Well, I'll see you later,
Randall Wilkerson.

83
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,792
Marshall Eriksen.

84
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,989
Gary Dinkersfield, right.

85
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,156
Great, he doesn't
remember you.

86
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,700
Not great.

87
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,125
Arthur Hobbs
hating Marshall,
that's no big deal.

88
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,700
He hates everyone.

89
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,668
It's the people
he doesn't know
that he cuts loose.

90
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,607
He just fired
What's-His-Face.

91
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,113
He fired
What's-His-Face, Ted,

92
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,784
and What's-His-Face
was invaluable.

93
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:04,984
Look, I can understand
you getting upset,

94
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,875
but it's not worth
killing yourself over.

95
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,947
Yeah, wait till
you get laid off,
then kill yourself.

96
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,447
Like What's-His-Face.

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,459
Although I guess now it's
more like Where's-His-Face.

98
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,033
Look, it was just
two cigarettes, okay?

99
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,931
I can handle two.

100
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,363
As long as I don't
have three within
24 hours,

101
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,030
then I'm not going
to get hooked again.

102
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,127
What's Lily going to say
when she finds out you smoked?

103
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,169
Lily's not going to find out.

104
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,835
I have a system.

105
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,373
OLDER TED:
Ah, yes, Marshall's system.

106
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,723
Hey, Lil.
You smoked.

107
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,817
Damn it!

108
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,789
OLDER TED: The next morning,
your Aunt Robin was thrilled

109
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,258
to be finally going on
the air with a real pro.

110
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:56,357
In three, two, one...

111
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,870
Hi, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

112
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,831
And I am Don Frank.

113
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,171
Two teens were
arrested late last night
for stealing a police cart.

114
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,137
No, I'm sorry, not
a police cart,
a police car.

115
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,677
(LAUGHING) Screw it.
Brain fart.

116
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,877
Don't you hate those?

117
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,515
Look at that,
the teleprompter's
still running.

118
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:17,792
Something about a woman
giving birth on an uptown bus.

119
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,721
Well, no point in
jumping in halfway.

120
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,017
I'll just wait
till it's done.

121
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:21,958
(GIGGLING NERVOUSLY)

122
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:27,157
And she
cut the cord
with a Metro Pass.

123
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,097
We'll be right back.

124
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,661
And we're clear.

125
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,870
What the hell was that?
Don, you said "brain fart."

126
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,603
Look, Robin,
you seem like a nice kid,

127
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,898
but this is my 39th
local news show, okay?

128
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,810
And in that time,
I've learned three things:

129
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,042
avoid the all-you-can-eat
sushi buffet in Bismarck,

130
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,938
do not go to the bathroom
with your lapel mic still on,

131
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,811
and three, at this hour,
your entire viewing audience

132
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,150
is one half-drunk slob
sitting in his
underwear, so...

133
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,847
MIKE: Back in five, four...

134
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,620
Well, let's
do a great show for
that half-drunk slob.

135
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,529
Well, that half-drunk
slob appreciates it.

136
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,362
OLDER TED: The next day,
Marshall found himself
craving a cigarette.

137
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:04,729
It was driving him crazy,
so he decided to get
some fresh air.

138
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,098
Oh, no. You're not
up here to jump,
are you?

139
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,370
No, no, no, no.

140
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,139
I fired a lot
of people today.

141
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,976
I don't
need another
jumper in my file.

142
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:15,742
(CHUCKLING)

143
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,750
Oh, uh, cigarette?

144
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,923
No. No, thank you.

145
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,652
That's too bad.

146
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,747
You know what
I miss, Jeffrey?

147
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,759
Getting to know
somebody over a smoke.

148
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,761
People are so
interchangeable now,

149
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,464
but you share a butt with
somebody, you got a real bond.

150
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:39,225
You know what?
I will take one.

151
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,239
Okay.
Thank you.

152
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:45,312
I'm Marshall, by the way.
It's Marshall,
Marshall Eriksen. Yeah.

153
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,642
Tell me something,
Marshall Eriksen.

154
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:52,778
How would you
like to see a picture of
the cutest dog in the world?

155
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,016
There he is.
He's a good boy.

156
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,762
Hey.
You smoked.

157
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:05,762
Yes, I smoked, and it
was my third of the day.

158
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,196
You know what that means?
I'm a smoker now.
It's all over.

159
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,701
I even bought a pack on the
way home and a lighter and
a Vikings lamp,

160
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,995
which has nothing
to do with anything,

161
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,066
but I saw it in
the window and
I liked it.

162
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,874
Damn it, Marshall.

163
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,636
We already have four
Vikings lamps and
smoking kills.

164
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,607
It was a way to
bond with my boss, okay?

165
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,475
You should have
seen me up there.

166
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,654
That is a cute dog.
Yeah.

167
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,523
Are those your kids?
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

168
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,881
Hey, look what
I got at the mall.

169
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,220
(CHUCKLING)

170
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,157
There he is. There he is.
Go ahead, you can pet him now.

171
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,258
No.

172
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,656
Yeah, yeah, come on,
he likes it.

173
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,955
Scratch him
under the chin.

174
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,001

175
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,365
(LAUGHING)

176
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,103
I don't care
what your reasons are.

177
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,338
You know how I
feel about smoking.

178
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,973
Now, give me the cigarettes.

179
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,209
And the lighter.

180
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,158
Ah! That's the stuff.

181
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,163
What?
What?

182
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,855
OLDER TED: Oh, yeah,
add your Aunt Lily
to the list.

183
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,927
Whenever Uncle Marshall
fell off the wagon,

184
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,966
your Aunt Lily got dragged
right down with him.

185
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,926
What you doing?

186
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,071
(SIGHING) If you must know,
I am reaching out to City Hall

187
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,866
to try to get the mayor
on our show.

188
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:28,108
Oh, my goodness,
you are adorable,

189
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,805
but the
mayor's not coming
on a show nobody watches.

190
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,708
My colonoscopy had
more viewers than
this show.

191
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,551
At least that had
some twists and turns.

192
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,986
Okay, you know,
I don't know why
you're acting like this.

193
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,691
I mean, maybe you're just
bitter because you never
had a shot at a network job,

194
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,724
but I think I still do,
so I really need to focus.

195
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,020
I've been on a network.

196
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,234
You were on a network?

197
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,995
It was
the best Labor Day
weekend of my life.

198
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,635
When you do the news,
you're in these
ergonomic chairs.

199
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,902
It feels like
you're sitting on a cloud.

200
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,570
Which was nice
'cause it was right
after my colonoscopy.

201
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,410
And the dressing rooms... Oh.

202
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,944
There's dressing rooms?

203
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,250
You bet your sweet headset
there's dressing rooms, Mike.

204
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,053
No changing
in the KFC bathroom
across the street. No, sir.

205
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,520
It was heaven.

206
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,287
But the second
you get used to it,

207
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,485
they go find
someone who isn't "going
through a bitter divorce"

208
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,227
and doesn't "reek of gin,"

209
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,633
and before you know it,
you're stuck in
a dead-end gig,

210
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,526
surrounded by
people going nowhere,

211
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,068
doing the news in
your tighty whities.

212
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:31,738
Okay, the underwear
thing was your choice,

213
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,035
and I don't like
that it's catching on.

214
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:36,606
Ah! Looking good, fellows.
Feels good, right?

215
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,407
God, I want to kill him.
Of course people watch
the show.

216
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:44,149
You guys watch the show,
that's, like, two right there.

217
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,957
Oh, my God.
You guys still
haven't seen my show.

218
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,461
What? We never miss it.
We've seen it!

219
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,333

(BOTH STUTTERING)

00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,558
It's black.
Right. Yeah.

222
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,931
With, like,
silver around the edges.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,140
Not your TV set,
my show set.

224
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,642
BOTH: Oh!

225
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,035
God, if I can't even get
my best friends to watch,
who's going to watch?

226
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:11,177
Lots of people.
You got bedridden insomniacs.

227
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,354
Bums camping outside
a department store.

228
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,724
People waiting in the ER,
where the TV is in a cage,

229
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,245
so you can't
change the channel.

230
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,157
Do you have any stalkers?

231
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:26,532
Yeah, but
even Leonard
won't watch my show.

232
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,633
I can't believe those guys
are smoking out there.
It's freezing out.

233
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:33,127
Remember when you used
to be able to smoke
in bars?

I think that hot girl
over there's smiling at me.

TED: Polo!
BARNEY: Polo!

239
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:50,276
Well, it's dividing our group
into smokers and non-smokers.
And that's not healthy.

240
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,350
You're right.

241
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,553
Let's go have a smoke.

What?

I'm not proud of it.

Look at you two. Smokers.
Just like the rest of us.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,799
I am not a smoker.
I only smoke in
certain situations:

247
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:15,781
post-coital,
when I'm with Germans...
Sometimes those two overlap.

248
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,783
...coital, birthdays,
to annoy my mom,

are mathematically

'cause Lord knows I have,
pregnancy scares.

Why are you
smoking right now?

I'm always pre-coital, Ted.

254
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,128
You know, maybe
smoking's not so bad.

255
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,397
I mean,
at least it gets us
out in the fresh air.

really works my abs.

to myself at 13 years old.

back to that moment...

a second.

to that interview smelling
like smoke?

a little bit closer to
your ass!

334
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,241
I am ready to
do this right now!

OLDER TED: None of us knew
what we were fighting about.

336
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,149
We just knew
we wanted to smoke,

337
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,984
more than anything
in the world.

(MARSHALL GRUNTING)

339
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,033
OLDER TED:
It wasn't going very
well for Robin, either.

340
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,892
Sorry I'm late.

341
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,300
Someone used
the microwave, and
the elevator stopped.

342
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,500
What are you doing?

343
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,025
Okay, Don. Don,
seriously, not tonight.

344
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,871
Okay, I'm a little bit
on edge

345
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,765
because I quit smoking
for my interview with
the mayor, so just...

346
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:42,337
Oh! Oh,
you precious little
porcelain unicorn, you.

347
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,679
(CHUCKLES) Why
would you do that?

348
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,013
Why?

349
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,519
Because I care, Don.

350
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:52,291
I care about the show,
I care about my career.

351
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,562
Unlike you,
you unprofessional jerk!
You're sloppy, you're rude,

352
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,693
and I wish you worked
half as hard

353
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,428
as the elastic on those
stretched-out underpants.

(SIGHS)

355
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,633
I'm starting to feel
like this is getting
a little personal.

356
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,097
No, Don, it would be
getting personal if
I would say

357
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,437
that the
reason you bounce
from market to market

358
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:13,312
is because
you're a loser.
A lazy, obnoxious loser.

359

Hi, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

362
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:31,915
You think I'm a loser?
You're right. I'm a loser.

363
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,491
But at least
I've accepted it.

A plucky raccoon has
been cheering up patients

at a local
senior center.

366
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,627
I used to be just like that.
Always wanting more and
never getting it.

367
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,471
It's a dead end, Robin.

368
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,137
You're never going
to be a network anchor.

369
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,507
Just like you're never
going to quit smoking.

370
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,776
What are you doing?

371
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,954
I'm enjoying a cigarette.

372
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,523
Oh! That'll get you there.

373
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,419
That's good.

Yeah. Professionals?

You know who's working
the camera right now?
A chair.

We're on a show
where we can't even
get the cameraman to watch.

That's why the mayor
canceled, Robin.

380

And that's why Mike is
on a fried chicken run.

No, thank you.

Why?

Because of
our millions and millions
of impressionable viewers?

Okay. If any
impressionable viewers
have a problem with this,

we're all going to smoke.

how dangerous it is
to wake a sleep-smoker?

It's fine. I bought
a pack on my way home.

Yeah.

Yeah, but that Don guy,
what a tool.

Well, no,
he actually
apologized to me.

No, I mean when he stood up.

pretty revealing.
