I'm good, Boomer.

Gentlemen,
I'm a faculty member,
and you're under age,

12

to confiscate this
and this and...

You can keep that.

what I didn't know was

somewhere in that class,

"Drop the act, baby doll.

Then when she brings it,
I'll just spit it out

anywhere near as hot

to that woman,

the school's policy

202
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,809
about students and
professors dating
is really strict.

she has a point.

Yeah, and think about it.
If the rules are that strict,

your job in jeopardy.

they were right.
I had to let it go.

The Unicorns?

339
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,608
Who Will Cut Our Hair
When We're Gone?

340
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,154
I have never met
anyone else
who has this album.

341
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,220
That's my roommate's.
I borrowed it.

342
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,379
Oh.

343
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,487
Well, well, what about this?
World's End by T.C. Boyle?

344
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,790
That was a birthday gift
from my roommate.

345
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,092
Haven't checked it out yet.

346
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,394
Oh.

347
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,155
Oh, you should.
It's a good read.

348
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,802
What about this?
This is ridiculous.

349
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,600
You play bass?
Seriously, ask my friends.

350
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:44,243
I always say,
"My ideal woman

351
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,211
"does not play bass,"
because this is clearly
your roommate's.

352
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,277
She's in a band.

353
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,178
Damn, that's cool.

354
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,778
This is unbelievable.

355
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:58,153
You just picked out the
only three things in here
that are my roommate's.

356
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,515
So, does your
roommate's band
ever play shows, or...

357
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,552
Get out.

358
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,392
OLDER TED: Kids,
as you probably guessed,

359
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,025
that wasn't the night
I met your mother.

360
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:14,073
Although I think
I glimpsed her foot.

361
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,801
But I did get a little bit
closer to meeting the woman
of my dreams.

362
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,567
And your mom?
Well, she got her
yellow umbrella back.

363
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,705
He was just so special,
you know?

364
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,376
I feel like
we should give him
a moment of silence.

365
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,116
Followed by, like,
20 minutes of grunting.

366
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,821
I'm gonna make you
feel all better.

367
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,486
Hmm.

368
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,385
Let me just
go freshen up.
All right.

369
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,528
Oh, wait. No, no,
that's not the bathroom!

370
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,562
That...

371
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,497
Are these yours?

372
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,635
I'm suit-sitting
for someone.

373
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,170
Barney, you lied to me.

374
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,865
(SIGHS)

375
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,576
You have to choose right now.

376
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,409
Me or the suits.

377
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,191
* I know what you're thinking
What's Barney been drinking?

378
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,819
* That girl was smoking hot

379
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,655
* Yes, I could've nailed her
But no, it's not a failure

380
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,490
* 'Cause there's
one thing she is not

381
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,655
* To score a ten
would be just fine

382
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,564
* But I'd rather be
dressed to the nines

383
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,567
* It's a truth
you can't refute

384
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,643
* Nothing suits me
like a suit!

385
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,480
* Picture a world
Where all the boys and girls

386
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,579
* Are impeccably well-dressed

387
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,881
* That delivery guy
in a jacket and tie

388
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,753
* That puppy in
a double-breast

389
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,192
* That '80s dude
with muttonchops

390
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,718
* That baby
with a lollipop

391
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,823
* That lady cop
who's kind of cute

392
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,197
* Nothing suits them
like a suit

393
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,229
* Suits
* A wingman I can wear

394
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,274
* Suits
* They're oh, so debonair

395
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,270
* Suits
* The perfect way to snare

396
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,342
* A girl with daddy issues

397
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,770
* Suits
* In navy blue or black

398
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,466
* Check out this perfect rack

399
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,438
* I want to give them
a squeeze

400
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,707
* Oh, really?

401
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:12,346
* Then answer these questions
if you please

402
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,564
* What would you do
if you had to choose

403
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,832
* Between your suits
and a pot of gold?

404
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,900
* Suits

405
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:23,999
* What would you say
if you gave your suits away

406
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,860
* And in return
you'd never grow old?

407
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,027
* Suits

408
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,025
* What would you pick?
One million chicks

409
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,766
* Or a single
three-piece suit?

410
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,671
* It's moot

411
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:31,703
* What if world peace
Were within your reach?

412
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,638
(STUTTERING)
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

413
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,813
It's suits. Come on,
Lily, get your head
out of your ass.

414
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,682
* Two, three, four

415
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:43,578
* Girls will go
and girls will come

416
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,316
* But there's
only one absolute

417
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,463
* Every bro on the go
needs to know

418
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,318
* That there's no
accepted substitute

419
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,358
* I'm sorry, suits,
let's make amends

420
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,504
* My Sunday best
are my best friends

421
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:03,200
* Send casual Friday
down the laundry chute

422
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,910
* 'Cause nothing
suits the undisputed

423
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:16,654
* Oft-saluted
suitor of repute

424
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,645
* Like

425
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,664
* A

426
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,759
Wait for it.

427
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:34,599
* Suit

428
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,604
* Nothing suits him

429
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:40,966
* Like a suit

430
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,907
* Suit Up! Suit Up!

431
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,942
* Suit Up! Suit Up!

432
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,022
Then again,
she is pretty hot.

433
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,321
I choose you, baby.

434
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,024
First thing tomorrow,
I'm getting rid
of these suits.

435
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,264
Really?
Yeah.

436
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,429
BARNEY: Mmm.

437
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,602
(WHISPERING)
You guys are fine.
