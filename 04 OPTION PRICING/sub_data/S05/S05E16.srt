00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:04,435
OLDER TED: Kids,
in many of my stories,

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,572
I'm a starry-eyed romantic
on a noble search for
true love.

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,607
In this one,
I'm just a jerk.

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:13,283
Well, guys,
tonight is the night.

5
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:17,094
I'm inviting Tiffany up to
my place to see my antique
camera collection.

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,348
It's Ted's bait.
Bait?

7
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:22,117
A true gentleman
invents a pretense to lure

8
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:24,056
an honorable lady
into his apartment,

9
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:26,162
some item of
interest or beauty

10
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:27,804
you can both pretend
to admire for five minutes

11
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,398
before she hops
on your disco stick.

12
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,071
Right. She's coming
up to borrow a book,

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,800
or check out
an album on vinyl.

14
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,304
Or to see your
new rap poster.

15
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:38,666
(SCOFFS) Rap poster?
Who would that work on?

16
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,436
It was the
first week of college.

17
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,784
I was really
into Wu-Tang Clan.

18
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,254
Yeah, bait is tricky.

19
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,779
It has to be something
interesting enough
to get the girl upstairs,

20
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:50,445
but not so interesting
that it overpowers
the night.

21
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,794
BARNEY: I found that
a slot machine was too fun.

22
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,260
(EXCLAIMING)

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,130
And a trampoline turned
out to be too dangerous.

24
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,502
But then I found
the perfect bait.

25
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,202
A teacup pig.
(GRUNTING)

26
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,204
Oh...

27
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:10,636
A teacup pig?
Who's that working on?

28
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,641
You have a teacup pig?
You have a teacup pig?

29
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,183
Can we see the teacup pig?

30
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:15,979
Can I borrow
your teacup pig?

31
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,809
Yes, you can
borrow my teacup pig.

32
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,645
You have a teacup pig?

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,550
Oh, my gosh,
I can't believe
you have a teacup pig.

34
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,682
You're just so cute.
Yes, you are
the cutest piggy ever.

35
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,762
What?

36
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,388
Were you always this pretty?
Or are you gonna give me
that whole

37
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,693
"Oh, in high school, I was
really shy and awkward" line?

38
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,155
I was shy and awkward.

39
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:36,795
I was like 100 pounds heavier
and I had these crazy
buck teeth.

40
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,170
Seriously?
No.

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,440
I've always been hot.
What are you gonna do?

42
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:47,313
Do you know who else
would love this teacup pig?

43
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,841
Hmm.

44
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:49,876
My boyfriend.

45
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,188
You have a boyfriend?

46
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,357
I know. So annoying, right?

47
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:11,266
I mean, he's not really
my boyfriend.

48
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,769
Oh, good.

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,400
I mean,
technically,
he kind of is.

50
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:16,736
Well, is he or isn't he?

51
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,470
Some of both, but
definitely not neither.

52
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,578
Are you getting any of this?

53
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,476
Look, I really like you.

54
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,883
I just need you to be patient.

55
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:31,145
I don't want to lose you,
big brown eyes.

56
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:37,791
Yep. Somebody doesn't
want to lose "big brown eyes."

57
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,495
Oh, Ted.
She's got you on the hook.

58
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,499
What? What?
I'm not on the hook.

59
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,771
Oh, you are
totally on the hook.

60
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,569
She's stringing you along,
but she's not committing
to you,

61
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,642
but she's keeping
you around, just in case,

62
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,911
like an old can
of chili in the pantry.

63
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,541
Um... Who's buying
canned chili and not
eating it immediately?

64
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,777
Amen, sister.

65
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:00,953
But, Ted,
don't feel bad.
We've all been there.

66
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,521
I've been on
both sides of it.

67
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,850
I've been a hookee
and a hooker.

68
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,785
Move past it, guys.
I've been a little bit loose,
but money never changed hands.

69
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,587
I've been on the hook.

70
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,395
Lisa Walker. Picture it.
1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.

71
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,726
So, I was,
like, thinking, Lisa,

72
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,740
do you maybe want to,
like, go out with me?

73
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,814
That sounds great.

74
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,682
But I'm sort of
seeing this guy.

75
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,781
He's got
a LeBaron convertible
and an in at the roller rink,

76
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,683
so I'd hate to
burn that bridge.

77
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,820
I understand.

78
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,950
But how about this?

79
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,688
You can be my secret boyfriend
who does all my homework
for me.

80
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,304
All right.

81
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,397
You want to
see my rap poster?

82
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,395
Poster whore!

83
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,965
Anyway, Lisa Walker
strung me along for months

84
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:02,605
until, one night, I went
to go tell her how much
I loved her,

85
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:03,613
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN ADMIRATION)

86
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:04,854
in song.

87
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,608
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN DISDAIN)

88
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,577
MARSHALL: She wasn't
home yet, so I waited.

89
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,419
And waited.

90
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,358
I woke up
four hours later
covered in snow,

91
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,632
and that's when I saw it,

92
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,702
Lisa's footsteps.

93
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,531
She had walked right over me
and into the house.

94
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,538
It was the best thing
that could've happened.

95
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,570
It got me off her hook.

96
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,935
Okay, that is definitely not
what's going on with me
and Tiffany.

97
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:34,744
Listen to this.

98
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,776
I'm really into you.

99
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,622
I just can't be
with you right now.

100
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,490
Eh? Eh?

101
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,789
Ted, "right now" is the
classic on-the-hook
catchphrase.

102
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,862
Yep. "Right now"
paints a picture of

103
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,961
some sort of
magical future time
when everything will work out.

104
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:56,333
But the truth is
that will never happen.

105
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,734
It's like this,
"I can't be with you."

106
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,496
Boom! "Right now."

107
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,895
(IMITATING DOOR CREAKING OPEN)

108
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,105
Yeah, I think my
high school boyfriend,

109
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,710
Scooter, is still
sort of on the
hook for me.

110
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,382
Sort of? He totally is.

111
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:14,082
The poor guy showed up at
our wedding hoping to win
you back.

112
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,854
Yeah. It's still sometimes
weird when I see him at work.

113
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,854
Wait, what?

114
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,787
Scooter works in
the school cafeteria.
We've talked about this.

115
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,134
Hey, Lily.
Nice dress. Tater Tots?

116
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,399
(MOUTHING) I love you.

117
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,773
We most certainly
have not talked about this!

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,370
Yes, we have.
I've mentioned
it tons of times.

119
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,813
Lunch lady Scooter.

120
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,408
I thought that you
were referring to some
sort of long overdue device

121
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:44,782
that carries
around those poor,
underappreciated lunch ladies.

122
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,582
This explains a lot.

123
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,675
Lunch lady Scooter
was there again today.

124
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:53,117
Yeah, did you jump on
that thing? Give it a ride?

125
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,393
No!
Really?

126
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:57,163
If it were me,
I'd be riding that
scooter all day long

127
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,930
until I broke
that thing in half.

128
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,161
So those poor women
still have to walk
everywhere?

129
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,797
Wait, Scooter is
working at your school?

130
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,044
Are you jealous?

131
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,769
No, I just feel
bad for Scooter.

132
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,135
'Cause the only reason he took
that job is he thinks he has
a shot with you.

133
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,414
You have to make it
clear that he doesn't
so that he can move on,

134
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,945
and a real lunch lady
can get her job back.
Damn!

135
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,680
I've tried.

136
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,646
Hey, Lily.
I saw you have
seventh period free.

137
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:29,616
So do I. You want
to run away together?

138
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:34,597
Let me be clear, Scooter,
there's no way you and I
can ever be together.

139
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,171
Right now.

140
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,605
I'll see you tomorrow, Lily.
It's Tijuana Tuesday.

141
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,477
"Right now"?

142
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,582
You "right nowed" Scooter?

143
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,615
You need to let Scooter
off the hook once and
for all.

144
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,090
You're right.
Day after tomorrow,

145
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,848
that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

146
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,117
Why not tomorrow?

147
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,694
Baby, I can't
ruin Tijuana Tuesday.

148
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,500
Really? You're really gonna
sit here all night watching
the door

149
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,531
because Tiffany said
she'll "try to stop by"?

150
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,797
Barney, I'm not gonna just
give up on her.

151
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,236
OLDER TED:
I should've
given up on her.

152
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,011
This girl is special.

153
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
She was the devil.

154
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,946
Things are gonna
work out with Tiffany.

155
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,078
No, they're not, dumbass!

156
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:31,115
Ted, let me be clear,
this girl is a poison

157
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,521
and you need to cut her
out of your life forever.

158
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:36,793
Hey, there she is.

159
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,104
Oh, she brought
some of her co-workers.

160
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:50,167
Hang on to this girl, Ted.
Hang on to her and never
let go!

161
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,579
Ted, these are some of the
hottest girls I've ever seen.

162
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,982
And they all
work with Tiffany?

163
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:00,953
Yep.

164
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,221
There can only be
one explanation
for this.

165
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:09,791
Ted, is
Tiffany a (STUTTERS)
pharmaceutical sales rep?

166
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,263
Yeah. How did you know that?

167
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,831
And you never
thought to mention that?

168
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,895
What? It's just a job.

00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,702
Ted, throughout time,

172
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,937
there has always been
one cutting-edge profession

173
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,943
to which hot girls,
like Tiffany, have flocked.

174
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,106
Shall I walk you
through the history?

175
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,983
I'm gonna explicitly say no.

176
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,052
It all started
2.5 million years ago.

177
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,178
BARNEY: Man was a hunter.

178
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,747
So the hottest profession
of the day? Gatherer.

179
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,858
Homo erectus, indeed.

180
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:50,634
As man mastered technology,
the hottest profession of
the day evolved.

181
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,234
I'm pretty sure
it's a hernia.

182
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:52,965
Can you check again?

183
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,335
And then man
took to the skies.

184
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,313
And so hot women
put on high heels
and became stewardesses.

185
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,183
I am in the upright
and locked position.

186
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,862
And then man said,
"Life is hard.

187
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,588
"I should
start taking lots
of prescription drugs."

188
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,855
And so,
hot girls rolled
into doctors' offices,

189
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,163
looking sexy enough to render

190
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,355
the very erection
pills they peddled
ironically redundant.

191
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,897
So, now, pharma girls are
today's hottest profession.

192
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,567
Hey, big brown eyes!
How are you doing?

193
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,975
I'm good.

194
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,678
Hey, by the way, you ditch
that loser boyfriend yet?

195
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:38,851
No, sir.

196
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,815
Touched my nose.

197
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:49,962
Dude, ditch Tiffany
and join the Barnacle in
a pharma girl free-for-all!

198
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,330
Side effects may include
loss of clothing, rug burn,

199
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,629
shortness of breath and sore
abdominals the next morning.

200
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,132
What in the world is up?

201
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:05,270
Hey, so, I know that
you've been having trouble
letting Scooter off the hook.

202
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,305
I decided what
you need is practice.

203
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,140
Now, you say
the problem is
his cute, sad eyes?

204
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,254
Well...

205
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,647

206
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,017
All right, shut it, woman.

207
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:25,034
Now, I want you to
look at this teacup pig,

208
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,898
and tell him that there's
no way that you could
ever be with him.

209
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:37,002
Teacup pig,
there is no way I
can ever be with you.

210
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,813
Oh...

211
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,009
Right now.

212
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,717
Oh, come on, grow a pair!

213
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:52,849
I'm sorry. But he's
just so freaking cute.

214
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:57,186
I just want to cuddle him
all day long. Yes, I do.

215
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,734
You know, it's funny,
I remember when you used to
say things like that about me.

216
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,060
Well, I still do.

217
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,834
Yeah. Not as much, Lily.

218
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,771
Not as much.

with her boyfriend.

not on the hook.

229

Oh, you're still on the hook.

230
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,859
Uh-uh. Listen to
how we spent last night.

231
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,862
TED: First, we cuddled.

232
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:40,796
Then, we shared
chocolate cake.

233
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,274
Then, well, I don't usually
join in on locker room talk,

234
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,744
but I gave her
a pretty sensual foot rub.

(INAUDIBLE)

236
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,910
And, let me guess, it didn't
go any further than that.

237
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,317
Well, no, but...

238
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,919
And, tell me,
did you by any chance
make that chocolate cake?

239
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,290
It was a mix.
Dude.

240
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,932
There's no shame
in admitting it, Ted.

241
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,858
We've all been
on people's hooks,

242
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,964
and we've all
kept someone on a hook.

243
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,096
Um, I most
certainly have not.

244
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:14,201
What? Are you joking?
What?

245
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,044
What about that girl from the
university library, Henrietta?

246
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,011
Henrietta and I
are just friends.

She gave me foot rubs.

Long ones.
I'm not proud, kids.

Henrietta around

for the same reason
that Tiffany likes
having you around.

It's a nice
little ego boost.

341
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,329
You know what?
We're not gonna work, ever.

342
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,630
I'm done.

343
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,566
And it's
really better
for the circulation

344
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,240
if you knead the arches
with your thumbs.
Now I'm done.

345
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,177
Marshall, I can
do this by myself.

346
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,479
Okay. Well, then, prove it.

347
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,081
And grab me a pudding.

348
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,559
Listen up, Scooter, there
is no way you and I will
ever be together.

349
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,403
MARSHALL: Right now!

350
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:15,302
Marshall!
I'm sorry. But he's adorable.

351
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,165
Listen, I don't
want to be with you.

352
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,105
Right now.
Hang in there, Scoots.
I'm not gonna live forever.

353
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,512
Last night,
I was with this
pharma girl who was so hot

354
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,475
you should call a doctor if
you don't have an erection
for more than four hours.

355
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,115
Am I right, people?

356
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,691
Yeah, there's no people.
Just the girl you most
recently dated.

357
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:41,089
Hey, Barney, I want you to
meet the newest pharma girl.

358
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,458
Gladys Reynolds. Nice
to make your acquaintance.

359
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,296
I represent
statins and other
cholesterol-lowering drugs.

360
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,304
Come on, girl.
Let's go get our drink on!

361
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:49,795
Okay.

362
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,341
It's over.

363
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,713
What's over?

364
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,182
Pharma girls are no longer
exclusively hot chicks.

365
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,682
It's the end of an era.

366
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,323
You're being
a little dramatic.

367
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,719
Am I?

368
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,420
It starts out with a Gladys.

369
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,493
Next thing you know,
a few not-so-fabulous
gay guys enter the ranks.

370
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:13,232
And before you know it,
pharma girls look like
the crew

371
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,330
on a Southwest flight
from Albuquerque to
Little Rock.

372
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,463
It's over.

373
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,171
Okay.

374
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,600
OLDER TED: So that night,
I went straight to
Henrietta's,

375
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,595
all set to let her
off the hook.

376
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,323
This is Jack.
He's the best
man at the wedding.

377
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,850
I'm done.

378
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,197
Yes! The answer is yes!

379
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:55,541
No!
Oh! It gets worse.

380
00:18:55,568 --> 00:19:00,438
It's perfect!
Mom, Dad! Ted proposed!

381
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,683
Oh, my God!
I knew this day would come!

382
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,209
Oh! Oh!

383
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,354
Son!
Yeah, well...
There's been a...

384
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:10,319
No! What did you do?

385
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,890
I seriously
considered just marrying
her out of sheer awkwardness.

386
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,561
But I did
what I had to do.

387
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,959
I did what anyone
keeping someone on
the hook should do.

388
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,662
I broke her heart.

389
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,595
Henrietta, I'm sorry
if this is blunt, but
I think I owe you this.

390
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,274
I don't want
to be with you.

391
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,369
Right now?

392
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,539
Ever.

393
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,406
But we're still
getting married, right?

394
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,505
It was brutal.

395
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,278
Oh. I'm sorry, buddy.

396
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,947
Honesty is tough, but in
the end, it's the far
kinder alternative.

397
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:48,657
Yeah.

398
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:50,659
Hey, sweetie.

399
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,926
Hey, Mike, I have
to tell you something.

400
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,365
Wait, did you finish
my delicates?

401
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,540
I got one more load.
Ah. It can wait. (CHUCKLES)

402
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:06,743
I...

403
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,479
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?

404
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,754
Still in
mourning over the end
of the pharma girl era?

405
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,853
No. I realized that
their reign had to end

406
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,856
to make room for some
new hot girl profession.

407
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,929
Maybe it'll be intergalactic
communications officer

408
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,999
on a rocket ship to
some distant solar system
we can't possibly imagine.

409
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,570
Maybe it'll be meter maids.
We just don't know.

410
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,538
But one thing is sure.

411
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:43,541
The future glows
like a giant sun

412
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,346
shooting amber rays of light
into our hearts and minds.

413
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,818
Wow, what changed your mind?

414
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,991
The realization that
hope springs eternal, Robin.

415
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,962
That and this little
bottle of purple pills
I found in my couch cushion.

416
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,332
I don't know what they are,
(LAUGHING) but they're
amazing!
