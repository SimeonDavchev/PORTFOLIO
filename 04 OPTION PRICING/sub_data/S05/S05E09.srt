to the prerecorded voice

my belongings?

the same thing for us.

not to interfere
with Lily's meal.

I supported you with
all of those random people,

170
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,255
but this is your father.

171
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,004
Okay, can't
we at least just
give him some turkey?

172
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,870
No.
Come on, Lily.

173
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,969
Please, I can't ask the guy
to leave on Thanksgiving.

174
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,171
Oh, you don't have to ask.

175
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,773
Just tell him that it's
really important that
he be here.

176
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,236
And before you know it,

177
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,684
he'll be
at a board game
convention in Toledo,

178
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,750
giving your braces money to
some guy claiming to be
Milton Bradley.

179
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,221
He was just out trying
to provide for the family.

180
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:40,319
No. No, that's
what my mom did
by working two jobs.

181
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,993
Marshall, that man broke
my heart every single
day for 20 years.

182
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,525
Well, then we'll just
give him some dark meat.

183
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,132
No, seriously, Robin,
you should get the slap.

184
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,567
I mean,
you're a great slapper.

185
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:59,114
In fact, I want to study
slapping under your tutelage.

186
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,309
I want to be
your slap-prentice.

187
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,782
Don't sell
yourself short there, Teddy.
You're a slapping rock star.

188
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,883
Your name should
be Eric Slap-ton.

189
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,915
Okay, okay, guys,
this is torture.

190
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,250
Just put me in the chair...
Slapping throne.

191
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,054
...and get it over with!

192
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,856
Okay, he's all yours.

193
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,488
No, no, no, no.
It's you, I insist.

194
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,822
Okay, I'll do it.
Great.

195
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,587
Wait, what?

196
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:19,726
I'm just saying,
I'll slap him.

197
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,900
What, so that's just, like,
the end of the discussion?

198
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,300
Well, you said
I could slap him.

199
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,871
Uh...

200
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,239
I was just being nice.

201
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,698
If anyone's gonna slap him,
it's gonna be me.

202
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,168
No, it's not.

203
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,642
This is interesting.

204
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,809
Lily, he's family, okay?

205
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:44,218
And I'm sorry, but you
just don't cut off family.

206
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,891
(SCOFFS) Well,
that's easy for you to say
when you come from the most

207
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,690
ridiculously close
family in the world.

208
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,023
We are not
ridiculously close.

209
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,888
Really?
Yeah.

210
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,696
What about the Eriksen
family dinner every
single Sunday?

211
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,869
Everything looks delicious,
Mother Eriksen.

212
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,228
Thank you, Papa Bear.

213
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,637
Marshall, would you like
to say grace?

214
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,711
Well, I would be
happy to, Mother.

215
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,610
Everyone, please join hands.

216
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,654
Dear Lord...

217
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,993
I'm sorry,
but that's weird.

218
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,348
A family should be that close.
And I want our future family
to be that close,

219
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,018
and that includes your dad.

220
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,256
I can't believe
you're taking his side.

221
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,932
Lily...
Let me be clear on this.

222
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:33,331
That man will never cross
the threshold into this
home, ever!

223
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,766
It's just gonna be,
like, five more minutes.

224
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,373
Hopefully soon, amigo.

225
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,714
I'm fighting
a losing battle
with hemorrhoids here.

226
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,411
That's one
of the diseases?

227
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,810
No.

228
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,375
Ted, there is an hour
before the sun sets,

229
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,017
at which point,
neither one of us
gets to slap Barney.

230
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,422
So, just let me have it.

231
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,324
I'm the one who had the idea
to call the Port Authority
Lost and Found.

232
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,956
That's a good point.
Rebuttal?

233
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,931
I'm the one who
slipped the guy
a 20!

234
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Philosophical conundrum.
Idea versus execution.

235
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,195
Please discuss at length.

236
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,231
I carried
that huge turkey
all the way up here.

237
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,896
I paid for cab fare.

238
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,065
Well, you slept with
one of my best friends!

239
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,213
What? You said you
were okay with that.

240
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,809
Well, I'm not!

241
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,311
Well, why didn't you
say something at the time?

242
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,142
Because I'm still
in love with you!

243
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,251
Do you really want
to slap Barney so bad

244
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,893
that you
would lie about
being in love with me?

245
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,758
I really want
to slap him, okay?

246
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:32,129
Yes, your dad has made some
mistakes in the past, but
he's a different person now.

247
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,059
He's moved out of
your grandparents' house.

248
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,234
He's got a job.
He's paying off
his IRS debts.

249
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,933
Wait, how do
you know all that?

250
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:40,927
Like, body language.

251
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,943
Okay, well, yeah,
we met for a drink last week.

252
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,784
I miss her a ton.
Little princess.

253
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,511
She ever talk about me?

254
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,076
Yeah. Yeah, like,
all the time. Um...

255
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,047
She tells this one
really sweet story about...

256
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:02,316
So never, huh?
No, not a word.

257
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:06,125
But it doesn't
have to be that way.
We can fix this, right?

258
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,899
(SCOFFS)

259
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:11,298
You know, I always thought
it'd get fixed at the wedding.

260
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,801
I even wrote a toast.

261
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,944
But then, no invite.

262
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,839
Hell, I haven't even
seen a wedding photo.

263
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,875
MARSHALL: And then,
right before my eyes,
your father broke down crying.

264
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,953
(CRYING)

265
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,216
That's it! You're
coming to Thanksgiving!

266
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,863
You invited him?

267
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:38,358
The guy
was, like, blubbering.
What was I going to do?

268
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,431
And then,
some jerk at the next
table called him a sissy,

269
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,900
which I thought was
totally uncalled for.

270
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,429
I can't believe you.

271
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,003
Marshall, what gives you
the right to do that?

272
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,373
You and I are married.
And that means he's
my family, too.

273
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:59,305
Mickey, come on in.

274
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:16,162
Ted, you better roll quickly.
Your gallbladder's about
to burst.

275
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,026
You know,
Mickey, it's been,
like, half an hour.

276
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,895
I think we should
go look for Lily.
Nah.

277
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,603
She just needs some
time to cool down.
Let's finish the game.

278
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,144
Yeah, play another round.
Best of seven!

279
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,941
Damn it, Robin!
I've known Barney
the longest.

280
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,384
I get to slap him.

281
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,948
That slap is mine, Mosby.
I've never slapped Barney

282
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,549
above the waist.

283
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,221
Look,
I've wanted to slap Barney
since the moment I met him!

284
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,249
ROBIN: You don't think
that I want to slap Barney?

285
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,894
I've waited so...

286
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,549
Wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

287
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:43,517
This slap was supposed to
be a wonderful thing, a gift,

288
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,256
and look, it's turned
us against each other.

289
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,259
My God, you're right.

290
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:52,066
This once
pure fruit has turned
into a poisoned slap-ple.

291
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,543
You know what?
Seriously, you take it.

292
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,998
Are you sure?

293
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:57,837
Slap-solutely.

294
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,637
I really think that we
should go look for Lily.

295
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,014
Ted? Gallbladder about to pop.

296
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,445
Okay, it's decided.

297
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,049
Barney, come on.
Get in the throne.

298
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,652
Are you...
Yep. Come on.

299
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,953
(STUTTERING) Well, you...

300
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,516
Well, I guess that is
the best decision, Robin.

301
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,425
I mean, men are
stronger than women.

302
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,228
Don't listen to him.

303
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,330
Okay? It's been decided.
Okay.

304
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,602
I mean, that's what
you've always wanted,
isn't it, Robin?

305
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:28,041
A strong man to
take care of you?

306
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,498
I mean,
sure, growing up,
you were a scrapper,

307
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,607
playing hockey with the boys,
skinning your knees on
the ice.

308
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,611
But what
you couldn't
tell your teammates,

309
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,913
what you couldn't
even tell yourself,

310
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:44,647
was that
all you really wanted
was that pretty, white dress

311
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,454
in that pretty, white chapel.

312
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,917
And at the end of
that center aisle,

313
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,387
strewn with
pretty, white flowers,

314
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:57,256
a man, to do all of
your slapping for you.

315
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,397
Let me at him!
Robin! Come on!

316
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,701
Hold on!

317
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,972
Whoa!

318
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,502
Oh, my God.
What just happened?

319
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:08,377
Sorry, Ted.
Gallbladder burst.
You move back three spaces.

320
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,642
You come in here,

321
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,648
and you watch your
daughter leave and
you don't even care.

322
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,520
And now
you've destroyed
Thanksgiving dinner!

323
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,519
Lily worked
all day on this!

324
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,591
Relax. It's not real bile.

325
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,190
It's just
lead-based
paint from China.

326
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,563
And horse bile.

327
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,732
OLDER TED:
And at that moment,
Marshall gave Mickey a look

328
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,430
none of us had ever
seen him give anyone.

329
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,704
What's this?
What's he doing?

330
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,432
Did you swallow
some of that paint?

331
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,697
This is my
you're-dead-to-me look.

332
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,636
Oh.
Okay.

333
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,141
Yeah, you know,
Lily's is so much better...

334
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,543
Get out of my house!

335
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,408
Hey.

336
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,376
Mr. Park's, huh?
This is the last place
I expected to find you.

337
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,088
Marshall...

338
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,020
Lily, I'm sorry.
But just hear me out.

339
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,086
I used to think
that family was a right.

340
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,426
But it's not.
It's a privilege,
and it has to be earned.

341
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,555
I kicked your dad out.

342
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:09,337
And I promise, baby, I will
never make you see him again.

343
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,769
Now what? Baby,
what, what, what happened?

344
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,674
Marshall, I came in here
because it was cold

345
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,637
and this was the only place
that was open.

346
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,206
I wasn't even gonna
look Mr. Park in the eye.

347
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,520
And then I found out

348
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,579
Mr. Park died.

349
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,715
Oh, my God.

350
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,723
He really is dead to me.

351
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:34,226
And if I feel this bad
about never making up
with Mr. Park,

352
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:37,131
a guy who meant
literally nothing to me,

353
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,634
(CRYING)

354
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,043
we gotta go get my dad.

355
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,670
Okay. Here.

356
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,275
OLDER TED: So that's how
on Thanksgiving, 2009,

357
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,108
your Aunt Lily
performed a miracle.

358
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,014
She brought a man
back from the dead.

359
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,447
Everyone.
Before we get started,

360
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:03,224
Barney, we're going
to need you on the
slapping throne.

361
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,786
Slap Bet Commissioner,
surely tying me to
a chair is a breach...

362
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,555
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Less yapping, more slapping.

363
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:12,367
Ted, Robin. It's two
minutes until sundown.

364
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,369
Have you
guys decided
which one of you is

365
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,501
going to get to slap
Barney right in his face?

366
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,241
It's gonna be Ted.

367
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,413
What? Why me?

368
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:27,152
Last year, you got left at
the altar. You lost your job.

369
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,550
(SIGHS) But you've come
such a long way since then.

370
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,723
I'm so proud of you, Ted.

371
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:36,222
You deserve to slap someone
in his face as hard
as you can.

372
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,690
Thanks.

373
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,585
Oh, this is the worst.

374
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,274
Mama!

375
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:53,412
No, Robin.
Look. You just went
through your own breakup,

376
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,510
and while I
know you and Barney
left it on good terms,

377
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:59,812
isn't there some
part of you, deep down,
that wants to slap him

378
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:00,676
right in his face?

379
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:02,878
There is.

380
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,315
I know there is.

381
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,551
This is
basically
hell on Earth.

382
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,586
All right.

383
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,564
Don't.

384
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,733
TED: You got this.

385
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,431
It hurts!

386
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,603
No. I can't do it.

387
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,501
I can't take
this from you, Ted.

388
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,603
Nor I, you.

389
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,544
Thank God.

390
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,410
So, I'd like to
make a gesture.
Mickey?

391
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,709
Oh, no way!

392
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,541
I'm glad you and Lily
are trying to work
things out.

393
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:35,418
So, to welcome you
to our little family,

394
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,148
I'd like to
offer you this slap.

395
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:38,654
Really?

396
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,623
Well, I feel
a little weird.

397
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:46,285
I just met Barney and I don't
have anything against the guy.

398
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:50,226
But how often do you get
a chance to slap someone
right in his face?

399
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,233
(CHUCKLES)

400
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,295
(GRUNTS)

401
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,573
Soft!

402
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,572
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

403
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:01,937
(SIGHING) Thank God.

404
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,514
Lily,

405
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,184
I know I haven't been
much of a father to you.

406
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,683
You are kidding me.

407
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:12,245
So, for all the ballet
recitals that I missed,

408
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,915
for all the art shows
that I should've been at,

409
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,485
for the wedding
gift that I never got
a chance to give to you,

410
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:24,196
princess, I give
this slap to you.

411
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,231
Oh, Daddy!

412
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,766
No. No, no, no, no.

413
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,241
She is the Slap
Bet Commissioner.

414
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,940
She's supposed
to remain impartial!

415
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,811
Slap Bet Commissioner
says it's okay.

416
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,907
This is not good.

417
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,883
Okay.

418
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,981
Please, please, please.
Let me, let me, let...
Shh.

419
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,883
Just close your eyes.
It'll be over soon.

420
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,845
Running through a meadow.

421
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:51,357
I can't do it.
Why can't I do it?

422
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:56,431
Because this slap has done
exactly what I hoped.

423
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,373
It's brought us
all closer together.

424
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:02,268
And it's caused us to
recognize both the frailty

425
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:06,372
and the greatness in
ourselves and each other.

426
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,666
Oh, give me a break.

427
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:09,941
And that is why

428
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,748
there will be no slap today.

429
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,582
(EXCLAIMS)

430
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,647
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my God!

431
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,216
This is the best
Thanksgiving...

432
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,326
That's four!

433
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,428
So, turkey?

434
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,935
