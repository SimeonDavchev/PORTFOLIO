OLDER TED: Kids,
when you're in your 30s
and live in New York,

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,338
there's a few places
you just never want to be.

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,207
Times Square on
New Year's Eve.

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:10,136
Rockefeller Center
around Christmastime.

5
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,911
Yeah.
But most of all...

6
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:15,479
A college bar?
Man, we're probably
gonna run into my students.

7
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,189
They're gonna corner me
and want a free lecture.

8
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,592
I don't even have
my slide projector.

9
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:23,664
Ted, I've been
skee ball champ here
since law school.

10
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,594
I have to pop in
at least once a month
to maintain my record.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,800
Whoa, looks like
you've been gone awhile.

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,072
Some guy named Big Fudge
has been cleaning up.

13
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,872
Yeah, he has.

14
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,143
And you're Big Fudge.

15
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:37,512
The biggest.

16
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,571
So, by the way,
I have to tell
you something.

17
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,709
Yep.

18
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,083
I invited Jenkins.

19
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:44,013
Jenkins? No way.

20
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:47,348
We'd all started
hearing about Jenkins
a few weeks earlier.

21
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:50,115
You guys will not believe
what Jenkins did this time.

22
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,954
Who's Jenkins?

23
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,759
He's this
hilarious new lawyer
at Marshall's office.

24
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,892
Hilarious!

25
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,257
Okay, so, there's this jar
of maraschino cherries in
the fridge at work,

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,658
so Jenkins says,

27
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,530
"200 bucks,
I'll eat the whole jar."

28
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,674
So we give Jenkins
200 bucks,

29
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,565
and Jenkins ate
the whole jar!

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,310
(LAUGHING)

31
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,405
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

32
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,748
Jenkins.

33
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,683
OLDER TED:
And after that,
the stories kept coming.

34
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,189
So the CFO comes in
to sign some
acquisition papers.

35
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,618
So Jenkins goes,

36
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,317
"Excuse me, Mr. Wilcox.
I think we forgot
one of the documents."

37
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:40,068
Jenkins!

38
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,104
So we all go out
for beers after work.

39
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,070
Jenkins gets up
on the table

40
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,438
and starts gyrating
like some sort of
deranged stripper.

41
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:51,848
Next thing you know,
off comes the shirt.
It was so gross.

42
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,854
Jenkins.
Jenkins.

43
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,915
Right?

44
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,124
Well, it'll be great
to finally meet
the famous Jenkins

45
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:01,047
after all those
stories.
Yeah.

46
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,891
And there's about
to be one more story.
I'm gonna bang Jenkins.

47
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,028
What?
You heard me.

48
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,704
You want to have
sex with Jenkins?

49
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,533
With Jenkins, on Jenkins,
near Jenkins. You name it.

50
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,840
I want to wear Jenkins
like a sock.

51
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:20,073
You... But you're...
Haven't you all...
I'm... Really?

52
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,780
Hey, guys.

53
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:22,842
Ted, this is Jenkins.

54
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:24,914
Oh!

55
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,163
Look, this is gonna
sound crazy,

56
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,899
but I thought
Jenkins was a guy.

57
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,774
What? That's crazy.
What gave you that idea?

58
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,804
I don't know, maybe
the whole Jenkins-peed-out-
the-window-of-a-cab story.

59
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,070
Yeah. Much more
impressive now,
isn't it?

60
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,268
Yeah!

61
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,610
Okay, I'll come clean!

62
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,035
It all started
a few weeks ago.

63
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,710
By the way, four eyes,
new lawyer.

64
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,149
This is Jenkins.

65
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,184
Watch out for this guy.
He steals stuff.

66
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,780
I don't steal stuff.

67
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,648
And I don't wear glasses.

68
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,185
I'm Marshall.

69
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,517
Hi, Marshall.

70
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,531
So, are you really
a Vikings fan,

71
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,563
or was he lying
about that, too?

72
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,268
Why? Is this a trap?
Are you a Packers fan?

73
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,801
My wife knows I'm here.
She doesn't have money,

74
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,597
but what she does have
is a very special set
of skills.

75
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,340
I'm a Vikings fan, too.
I bleed purple and gold.

76
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,006
I'm from Pelican Rapids!

77
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,314
Pelican Rapids? No way!
Yeah.

78
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,377
My grandpa lives
in Pelican Rapids.

79
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,445
Well, I mean,
he's dead now,

80
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,083
but he haunts a barn
off Route 108.

81
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,247
(LAUGHS)

82
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,586
TED:
Whoa! Hold it. Hold it.

83
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,821
Dude, if you tell me you
have a thing for a woman
that is not your wife,

84
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,257
I will drag you outside
and kick your ass.

85
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:45,363
Okay, first of all,
come on, buddy.

86
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,426
You can't handle
the Fudge.

87
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:51,465
Second of all, no,
I think of her
like a big brother,

88
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,602
who, I guess,
has boobs.

89
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,837
But so does
my oldest brother,
Marvin Jr. Anyway,

90
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,573
that night,
I told Lily about...

91
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,638
Jenkins.

92
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,977
I can't wait
to meet him.

93
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,312
MARSHALL:
I should have corrected her.
It would have been so easy.

94
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,419
But I didn't.

95
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,581
So, after that, whenever
I talked about Jenkins,

96
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,520
I always avoided pronouns.

97
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,756
So the head of marketing
comes in to choose people
for the mid-west audit.

98
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:19,763
So he goes, him,
him, her, him, him,

99
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,161
Jenkins, him, her...

100
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,370
I don't understand
why you wouldn't
just tell Lily.

101
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,833
Do you really think
she'd be all that jealous?

102
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,540
Ted, think about
those stories I told you.

103
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:40,647
(WHISTLING)

104
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,475
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

105
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,993
Yeah, I could see
how that'd be a problem.

106
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,564
Exactly. That's why
Lily can't find out.

107
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,193
Lily can't
find out what?

108
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,888
That Marshall's gonna
buy her a horse.

109
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,631
You are?
That is so awesome!
I love those things!

110
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,404
Guys, why is
that kid over there
staring at me?

111
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,872
I think I know
what this is.

112
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,640
I think it has
finally happened.

113
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,150
I'm getting recognized
from my show.

114
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,482
Robin, that is so cute.

115
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,719
But that's Scotty.
He's one of my students,
and he's looking at me.

116
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,086
How weird is it
that I'm more
famous than you?

117
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,324
(CHUCKLES) Not at all,
'cause you're not.
I'm on TV.

118
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:25,892
Yeah, and I have 30
students in my class.

119
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,759
That's what,
30 times your viewership?

120
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,429
Now let's give Scotty
a little thrill.

121
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,728
Buying a drink
for the old prof.

122
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,971
All right, Scotter,
one question about
neoclassical architecture

123
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,137
and that is it.
You're Robin Scherbatsky,
right?

124
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,476
What?
Yes, I am.

125
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,882
Wow! Look,
I didn't mean to stare.

126
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,314
It's just... I watch
your show all the time.

127
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,681

00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,857
It's Professor Mosby.

We're friends.

Holy crap!
Robin Scherbatsky's friends
with my econ professor!

133
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,198
It's architecture!

134
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,903
All right, you know what,
Scotty, you're crowding us.
Hit the bricks.

135
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:07,997
Wait a minute.
You're Big Fudge!

136
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,138
Go!

Hey, baby,
I'm on my way up.

00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,208
What? Why?

140
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,447
There was a measles outbreak
at school and they called
a half-day.

141
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:23,283
Thought I'd come by here,
have lunch, maybe give you
the measles?

142
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,520
Okay.

143
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:29,056
Um. I have a problem.
That was my wife.

144
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,562
When I first mentioned you,
she mistakenly thought
you were a guy,

145
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,055
and so...
So now you're worried

146
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,927
that once she finds out
I'm a woman, she's gonna
totally flip out.

147
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,196
Yes, exactly.

148
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,034
Oh, jeez. Oh, gosh.

149
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,439
Okay, okay.
I was in an improv group
in Pelican Rapids.

150
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,242

Okay.

Hi, Lily. I'm from
the French Embassy.

154
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:56,082
I'm here because of a small
but significant cheese
incident that occurred.

155
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,619
She's Jenkins!

156
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,887
You're Jenkins?

157
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,699
Yeah, well, that
Camembert crisis isn't
gonna resolve itself,

158
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,233
so I'll catch you guys
on the flip-flop.

Marshall cringed.

160

he had feared.

Anyhoo, lunch?

167

00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,027

she wasn't jealous.

169

of your relationship.

00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,734
What's that
supposed to mean?

171
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,198
Well, it's like this,
my man.

172
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,966
Every good relationship
has a reacher and a settler.

173
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:53,007
Exactly. One person
reaches for someone
out of their league,

174
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,813
the other one settles
for someone below theirs.

175
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,406
I did not settle for Lily.

176
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,548
Okay, yes,
she's a little short,

177
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:06,224
and true, my mom says she
doesn't have the hips to birth
an Eriksen child, but it...

178
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,756
Oh, my God,
you guys think
I'm the reacher.

179
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,691
That's why
Lily's not jealous.

180
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,827
The settler is never
jealous of the reacher

181
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,762
because where's
the reacher gonna go?

182
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,528
The settler, Lily, is the
best thing that the reacher,
Marshall, is ever gonna get.

183
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,599
No! Okay, yes,
I'm lucky to have Lily,

184
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:25,669
but Lily is just
as lucky to have me!

185
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,939
Okay? Neither one of us
is the reacher.

186
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,308
Dude, you are so the reacher.
You're getting her a horse.

187
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,608
(LAUGHING)

188
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,047
What?

189
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,575
Shh. Take the hit.
Take the hit.

190
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,290
Thus ending
modern architecture's
very brief experiment

191
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,956
with the V-frame house.

192
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,360
Um. Excuse me for a second.
What are you doing here?

193
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,671
(LOUDLY) I noticed
you forgot something
this morning,

194
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,244
so I thought
I'd bring it by.

195
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,342
Your pen.

196
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,813
This is your pen.

197
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,111
And you chewed on the end
of this recently.

198
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,843
Not a problem, Ted.

199
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,339
Your class was on
my way to work...
No, it's not.

200
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,480
...at
Come On,
Get Up, New York,

201
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,945
where I'm an anchor, so...

202
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,154
I watch your show
all the time.

203
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,193
What? You watch the show?

204
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:16,393
Oh! Well, paint me flattered!
Any other fans out there?

205
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,886
Oh! We got...
Okay, all right.

206
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,158
Thanks for
coming by, Robin.

207
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,186
Well, tune in tonight.

208
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,730
I'm doing a great piece
on snail poison.

209
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,495
Also, who's got
the worst pizza
in New York?

210
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,807
I'll give you the answer
after traffic on the ones,
threes, fives, and nines.

211
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,443
Really? You guys
watch her show?

212
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,978
It's like watching
a well-lit aquarium,
but not as interesting.

213
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,946
And now that I
think about it,
not as well lit.

214
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,584
Well, the truth is,
we watch it for
the drinking game.

215
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,492
The who now?

216
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,393
Her morning show
comes on so early

217
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,985
we're usually
still at the bar,

218
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,927
so whenever she
does an interview,

219
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,862
you have to drink
every time she says
"but, um."

220
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,569
"But, um"?
"But, um."

221
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,232
Apparently,
she says it a lot.

222
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,871
It's funny.
I had a drinking game
based on Robin,

223
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,867
but it was
actually on Robin.

224
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,269
I'd pour Peach Schnapps
in her belly button...

225
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,480
Dude, we agreed
we wouldn't do this.

226
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,011
Sorry. You're right.

227
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,947
She didn't like it anyway.
Said it woke her up.

228
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:17,522
Does she really say
"but, um" that much?

229
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,854
OLDER TED: That night,
we found out just
how much she said it.

230
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,421
That's great,
but, um...

231
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,719
"But, um."
Nice.

232
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,361
This wasn't your first
spelling bee, was it?

233
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,555
Nope. Third.

234
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,456
Oh! Good for you,
but, um...

235
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,329
But, um.
But, um.

236
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,828
But, um...
But, um... But, um...
But, um... But, um...

237
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:38,111
But, um... But, um...
But, um... But, um...
But, um... But, um...

238
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,371
(LAUGHING)

239
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,369
(SLURRING INDISTINCTLY)

240
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,180
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

241
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,747
Hmm.

242
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,576
Interesting article
in the paper.

243
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,761
Says that in every
relationship there's
a reacher and a settler.

244
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,022
Really? Let me see it.

245
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,389
It's not
in this newspaper.

246
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,128
It's in one
I read awhile back.

247
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:04,633
This newspaper reminded me
of the other newspaper.
Anyhoo...

248
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,628
What do you think
about that?

249
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,940
Well, I guess sometimes
that's the case.

250
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,470
But not in ours.

251
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,008
What? No, of course not.

252
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,273
Right.

253
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:20,183
Well, say,
gun to your head,

254
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:24,017
you had to say
one of us was
the reacher.

255
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:28,024
Well, I'd say it's neither.
That's what makes us great.

256
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,418
Okay, now,
there's a gun
to my head,

257
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,231
and our future children,
and our future cat or monkey,

258
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,764
depending on who wins
the game of Risk

259
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,729
we've been playing
for three years.

260
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,428
Nope. No reacher,
no settler.

261
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,170
Mmm. Mmm.

262
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,244
Well, how about this...

263
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,765
OLDER TED:
This went on for a while.

264
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,241
Until finally...

265
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,150
Our two kids,
our eight grandkids,
our 11 great-grandkids

266
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,145
are all on a plane
piloted by Oprah,

267
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,919
and it's about to crash
into an art museum

268
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,589
with all of your
favorite paintings,

269
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,256
and the only way,
the only way to
save everything,

270
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,226
is just to answer
the question.

271
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,455
Are you the reacher
or the settler?

272
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,170
And Oprah's
tried everything?

273
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,804
Everything!
You have to decide now!

274
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,571
(SIGHING)

275
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,339
Well, I guess
if I had to say,
then maybe I'd say

276
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,511
I'm the settler.

277
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,248
How could you say that?

278
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:30,524
She thinks that
she's the settler.

279
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,823
I mean, that's it.
I gotta prove to her
that I am not the reacher.

280
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,088
I gotta make
her jealous.

281
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,556
Well, that's easy.
Here's the plan.

282
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,794
Step one,
sleep with Jenkins.

283
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,060
Step two, I sleep
with Jenkins first.

284
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,059
Step three,
we do step two first.

285
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,271
I'm gonna go get
started on step two.

286
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,044
Okay, okay,
I got something.

287
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,443
Remember the other night,
the skee ball game?

288
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,314
When you were putting
nothing but wood
in the 50-hole?

289
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,943
Whatever.
Just another night
for Big Fudge.

290
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,479
(KABOOM PLAYING)

291
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:01,054
* Hello, baby, ooh!

292
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,124
* Swish, sock, bonk, ping

293
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,554
* Hello, baby, ooh!

294
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:11,685
* Fad, flip, flop, wing

295
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,588
* Ooh!

296
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,760
* Swish, sock, bonk, ping

297
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,400
* Hello, baby *

298
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,969
You thought
she was into me?

299
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,844
Full-on lady wood.

300
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:29,414
Yes. Of course.
A plan taketh shape.

301
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:34,776
If Lady Lily's jealousy
young Marshall cannot budge,

302
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,278
then perchance,
fair gentles,

303
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,920
Big Fudge can
make her jealous.

304
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:42,989
Okay, let me
try that again.

305
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,586
If Lady Lily...

306
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,087
I got it, buddy.
I got it.

307
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:52,001
Ted, I have got
a great idea.

308
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,695
Is it clean your hair
out of the shower drain
when you're done?

309
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,297
Seriously,
it's like you're trying
to carpet the tub.

310
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,640
If you wanted to print out
one of your lectures
or something,

311
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:05,877
I could read it on air.
Coming from a more
entertaining source,

312
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,416
your students might
actually pay attention
and learn something.

313
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,621
Oh! You're entertaining?

314
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,593
Last night there
was three minutes
of dead air

315
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,792
while you sewed a button
back on your sweater.

316
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,824
Look, just because
your class likes me
more than you...

317
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,331
You're a drinking game!

318
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,362
What?

319
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,998
That's why they watch.
They made a drinking game
out of you.

320
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,973
Every time
you say "but, um,"
they do a shot.

321
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,373
"But, um"?
Yeah.

322
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,565
I don't say "but, um."
I have never said "but, um."

323
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,738
Well, then I guess
it's not a very good
drinking game,

324
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,736
which would mean last night,
when Barney and I played it,

325
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,608
I didn't get super wasted
and throw up all over myself.

326
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,219
(LAUGHING) Wait!
I did both of those
things, so face!

327
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,487
Hey, Jenkins.
Hey, buddy.

328
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:54,556
Hey, so Lily and I
are gonna go back to
that college bar again,

329
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,197
and we were wondering
if maybe you wanted to come.

330
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,504
You could just, like,
watch me play skee ball,

331
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,436
or do exactly what
you did the other night.
Something like that.

332
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,272
It's really up to you.
I mean, I know that...

333
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,011
(SCREAMING)

334
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,019
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

335
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,890
Hey, baby,
what are you doing home?

336
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,000
"Baby"? That's a name
I don't deserve.

337
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:31,927
What?

338
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:32,699
Jenkins kissed me.

339
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,740
She kissed me.

340
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,072
The other day she
saw me play skee ball,
and I don't know,

341
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,609
I guess she caught some
of the Big Fudge fever.

342
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,844
But you have to know,
I stopped it right away,

343
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,411
and you're the only one
for me, baby.

344
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,016
Oh, I see what this is.

345
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,115
This is about the whole
reacher-settler thing.

346
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,058
Come again
for Big Fudge?

347
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,834
You want to make me jealous,
so you're making up a story
about Jenkins.

348
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,863
I'm not making this up!
This happened!

349
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,230
That woman kissed me,
with tongue.

350
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,369
Her tongue
was in my mouth!

351
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,295
Sure it was.

352
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,710
It was thick and rough,
like a starfish arm!

353
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,083
I'm so jealous!
I'm just gonna
go over there

354
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,814
and punch her
right in the nose.

355
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,208
Give her
a knuckle sandwich!

356
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,481
Come on, baby.
You want some soup?

357
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,988
It happened!

358
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:31,355
Do you have any
split-pea left?

359
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,060
These are just a few of
the many contributions
he made to architecture,

360
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,570
and yet,
he is only remembered
for one thing.

361
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:46,073
That, my friends,
is the sad legacy of
Gregorio Francetti Gazebo.

362
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,475
Any questions?

363
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,442
Hey, do you want to go out
drinking with us tonight?

364
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,151
What?
Yeah, we were gonna play

365
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,683
the Robin Scherbatsky
drinking game.

366
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,417
We were wondering
if you wanted to
join us.

367
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:01,554
Well, what can I say except,
"But-ums up."

368
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,091
Can I still come?

369
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,133
I'll pay.

370
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,355
(ALL MURMUR IN AGREEMENT)

371
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,070
So, your third book
was your breakout novel,
but, um...

372
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,044
But, um!
But, um!

373
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:19,343
Damn! Sorry.

374
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:23,336
But... Just "but,"
no "um." Just "but."

375
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,880
Your first novel was
written more quickly.

376
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,046
That's correct.
But, um...

377
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,675
But, um!
But, um!

OLDER TED:
And it was right then
that Robin got an idea

380
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,527
that would end
the drinking game forever.

381
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,132
I wanted to ask you
about the novel

382
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,595
you're writing
right now, but, um...

But, um!
But, um!

388

No. No, no, no.
Don't drink.
It's a trap.

389
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,114
I think I'm gonna go.
You can keep your 10 bucks.

I'm so sorry
I kissed you yesterday.

That's okay.

399
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,736
And I'm sorry I
had sex with you
in the mail room.

400
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,865
That wasn't me.

401

Good grief! That's two
awkward conversations
I have to have today.

402
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,184
I don't normally do that.
I was really drunk.

403
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,647
You were drunk
at 8:00 in the morning?

404
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,875
Yeah, I don't know
how that happened.

I thought snail pellets
were safe, but, um...

00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,829
I gotta get to work.

Man, that game is
really catching on.

Damn it!
How could I do this?

410
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,670
It's okay.

411
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,674
No, you know what?
It's not okay.

You're the nicest guy
in this stupid office,

413
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,841
and I really don't want
to screw up our friendship.

414
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,538
This is so embarrassing.
Please don't tell anyone.

415
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:09,021
No, who am I gonna tell?
Lily? I told Lily.

416
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,981
For Pete's sake.
Well, I gotta go talk to her.
I gotta apologize.

417
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,991
No! No! No!
Yes.

418
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:17,063
Marshall, I'm just gonna
tell her that it happened,
that it meant nothing,

419
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:17,893
and that I'm sorry.

420
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,227
No, I...

421
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:25,974
Yes. Yes. Do that.

422
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,302
I will.
Yeah,

423
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,697
and if you don't
have time for all that,

424
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,838
just tell her it happened
and that you're sorry.

425
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,974
And if you're in a real rush,
you don't even have to say
"I'm sorry."

426
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,410
Just tell her
that it happened.

427
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,175
That's the important part,
that it actually happened.

428
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:41,945
So, emphasize that
as much as you can.

429
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,254
And so, Lily,
I guess what I'm saying is,
it happened.

430
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:48,758
I feel terrible about it,
and I'm really sorry.

431
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,861
Well, it happened.

432
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:56,134
What are you gonna do?
It happened. Terrible.

433
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,595
But like I said,
it happened.

434
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,395
Exactly. And I feel
awful about it.

435
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:03,697
And I'd hate myself
if what I did hurt you
in any way,

436
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,970
or affected
your relationship
with Marshall.

437
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,278
Please forgive me.

438
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,481
Kiss my husband?
My husband?
