OLDER TED:
Kids, everyone has
one or two moments

2
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:05,442
when they make
a huge, crazy decision

3
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:07,183
that changes
their lives forever.

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,278
This is the story of mine.

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,310
It all started with
a visit from my mom

6
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,615
and her longtime boyfriend,
Clint, who was always saying
stuff like...

7
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:19,918
Ted, your mother
is a very, very
erotic woman.

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,623
Please don't.

9
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:26,285
As a painter/songwriter/
volunteer fear fighter,

10
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:31,527
I find her
incredibly sexual.

11
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:34,465
But you have
your own sexual memories
with your mom, don't you?

12
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:35,472
Please don't.

13
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,873
Exiting her womb.
Receiving her milk.

14
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,605
You get me?

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,740
(CHUCKLES) Good.

16
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,077
I cannot believe
I am with that man.

17
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:47,524
Mom, Mom, it's okay.

18
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,818
You don't have to settle.
There are plenty of guys...

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,720
He's so cool.
And he picked me.

00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,791
Well, I'm glad
you're both so happy.

00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,927
Well, good.
Because we do
have an announcement.

24
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,347
OLDER TED: Yes,
my mom was lapping me.

25
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,952
Getting married
for a second time,

26
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,853
before I was
even married once.

27
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:28,655
I was so
happy for them,
so freaking happy.

28
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,659
Still, weddings can
be magical.

29
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,061
For all I knew, I'd end up
sharing a dance with my
own future wife there.

30
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,104
And if you don't
boil those jam jars,

31
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,901
it's just
a welcome mat for bacteria.

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,703
OLDER TED: That wasn't her.

33
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,240

34
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:46,172
We are so happy for you.

35
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,537
I feel like
I'm 19 again.

36
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,506
It's like
the last 35 years of
my life never happened.

37
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:55,575
So wonderful to hear, Mom.

38
00:01:55,616 --> 00:02:00,216
Son, to show
that your mom and I
will always be there for you,

39
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:04,764
I want you to have this
beautiful picture, that
I painted.

well, this life,

48
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,619
I've waited for
a muse like Virginia.

49
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:30,217
Baby,

50
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,889
this is your song.

her trembling bosom

Oh, God.

how the song got
to this ending.

it's stupid, but...

what Robin just did?

73

And then,
I told you guys
what Robin just did,

74
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,963
but you were there for that.
I got to tell the rest of
the wedding.

I can't overstate

second wedding.

what about your toast?

emergency or
something.

he disappeared to.

maybe, let somebody

who isn't having some
sort of manic episode
drive for a while?

Yeah. And where
the hell are we going?

my mom get married,

I realized
how far behind
I was in my own life.

115
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,475
I just had to
get out of there.

116
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,347
So I went back
to my hotel room,

117
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,516
and got onto this Web site
I sometimes visit when
I can't sleep.

I didn't. I...

122
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,231
That's not the part
of the night I was
talking about.

123
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,735

real estate auction site.

124
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,938

properties and...

bought my dream house.

you bought this house?

I mean,
I made a bid online,

130
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,986
I won the auction
the next day, and
I got approval.

131
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,432
I just
finalized
the paperwork.

132
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,028
And was
the Blair Witch
easy to deal with,

133
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,400
or did she haggle
over the closing costs?

Don't even joke
about that, man.

room will be the study.

are welcome in here,

if they're reading
a book, but no toys.

139

It's not a question
of withholding love.

140

It's a question of
drawing boundaries.

This is gonna take years,
and a small fortune to
make livable.

I'm an architect.
I'll find a way.

And if I start right now,
it'll be done by the time

146

the old wifey and I
are ready to move in.

147
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,031
Is she in the room
with us right now, Ted?

Okay, okay.
I know. I haven't
found Mrs. Mosby yet.

You can't just skip ahead to
where you think your life
should be.

It doesn't work that way.
Yeah, I got to agree.

be the stupidest
thing you've ever done.

Let's lay off Ted.
Thank you.

158
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,375
All right. We've all done
some stupid things in
our lives.

159
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,186
For example,
I remember a time

160
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,548
when I dropped some
bottle rockets in
the toilet,

161
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,418
and I tried
to dry them off
in the microwave.

162
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,487
You must've been
drunk off your ass.

163
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,126
No. Too stupid
to be an adult.

164
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,700
He was
obviously a kid
when that happened.

165
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,559

a kid even get...

MARSHALL:
I was...

173
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,354
Drunk.

174
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,051
(DINGING)

175
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,383
Yeah.
Hey.

176
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,818
You know, I'm glad
Robin got it right.

177
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:37,694
(WHISPERING) 'Cause she's
very sensitive and fragile.

178
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:42,355
I'm referencing the time
she cried at Clint's song.

179
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,355
And even though
I'm whispering,

180
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,067
I actually hope
she hears me.

181
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,769
It wasn't me.

182
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,071
What?

183
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,442
I'm not the one who
cried at Clint's song.

185
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,583
CLINT: * ...and true

186
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,379
Are you crying?

187
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,981
I know
it's stupid, but...

188
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,483
CLINT: Everyone.
* And the dragon

189
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,845
* And the dragon

190
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,194
They're just so happy,
you know.

191
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,059
Not as happy as I am.

192
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,459
I will give you $500
if this just happened
to you instead of me.

193
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,631
500 bucks? Deal.

194
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,401
Thank you, Robin.

195
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,198
You just
saved me unspeakable
public humiliation and shame.

196
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,701
Hmm.

197
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,003
Guys, guys. Guess
what Robin just did?

(ALL LAUGHING)

199
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,344

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

201
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,136
Hi, I'm here
for the inspection.

202
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,175
Oh! Great.
I was worried
you weren't coming.

203
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,980
Well, I was actually
here a few minutes ago,

204
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,282
but I guess
the doorbell doesn't work.
Hmm.

205
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,783
Oh! Hey,

206
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,049
doorbell does not work.

207
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,318
Wait, wait,
you're just getting
this place inspected now?

208
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,187
Well, yeah.
Ted...

00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,685
(ALL CLAMORING)

210
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,957
All right.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

211
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,926
All right.
Let's all remember that

212
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,034
we've all done
some stupid things
in our lives, okay?

213
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,966
For example, I once
tried to ride my bike
down an extension ladder

214
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,613
from the roof of
a two-story house.

215
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,676
The only looming
question is,

216
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,909
was I drunk or a kid?

217
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,013
(GASPS)

218
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,384
Drunk.
Kid.

219
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,652
Drumroll, please.

220
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,077
MARSHALL: I was...

221
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,018
JUDY: (SCREAMING)
Marshall's dead.

222
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,623
Marshall's dead. Marshall.
MARSHALL: A kid.

(EXCLAIMING)

225
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,289
Moms, right?

226
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,497
Just always making
a big deal out of nothing.

227
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,270
Came out of that
coma in under a week.

228
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:29,338
Hey, let's check out
the porch, huh? Come on.

229
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,009
I'm gonna
put a grill out here,
every Sunday, right here.

230
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,209
It's gonna be
a total sausage fest.

231
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,410
Hmm.

232
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,611
Sausage party? Burgers.

233
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:37,854
Right, I'll do...
We'll do burgers.

234
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,348
Ted, stop it.
You can't keep this house.

235
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,780
It's a huge mistake.

236
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,375
Lily, listen to me.
I had a plan, okay?

237
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,047
Wife, house, kids.

238
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,686
As it turns out,
the universe is
being kind of a wad

239
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,392
about the whole
wife and kids part.

240
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,463
So what's the one
thing I can control?
The house. I bought it.

241
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,804
It's not a huge mistake.

242
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:00,369
Exactly. Now,
me driving my brother's
car the wrong way down I-94,

243
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,070
that was a huge mistake.

244
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,540
Drunk.
Kid.

245
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,671

(GRUNTING)

250
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,324
Wow, Barney,
what, did you cry on
that guy or something?

251
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,050
Uh... You got leaky pipes.

252
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,887
But the bright side, the pond
in your basement is drowning

253
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,963
some of the larger,
slower rats.

254
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:27,962
The rest of them, well,
they're headed this way.

255
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,030
See, you should've
waited to find out the
problems with this house.

256
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,997
You can always find
problems with any decision.

257
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,766
But you can't
let that stop you.

258
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,705
Freshman year,
Marshall knew right away

259
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,470
he wanted to
spend his life with you.

260
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,878
What if someone had been
there to second-guess
that decision?

261
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,652
Bye.

262
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,023
I know we've only
been on two dates,

263
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:54,221
but, damn it,
Lily Aldrin, I'm...
I'm gonna marry you.

264
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,294
Not so fast.

265
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,963
We got some
structural issues here.

266
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,525
These hips are not
Eriksen-baby compliant.

267
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:09,035
And this thing right here
does not have a proper filter.

268
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,709
That's a maintenance issue
that's never gonna go away.

269
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:15,779
And I know
you think that you like
this gothic exterior now,

270
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,909
but deep down,
didn't you always

271
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,745
picture yourself
in something Spanish?

272
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:24,548
I recommend you look
into the rental option.

273
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,524
But Marshall took
that leap of faith,

274
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,063
and it's the best thing
that ever happened to
you both.

275
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,390
It was Robin.

276
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:37,225
(GASPING) "What?"
Yes! It was Robin who
cried at Clint's song.

277
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,304
"But she said..."
I know what she said.

278
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,402
But here's what
she didn't want
you to know.

279
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:47,605
Listen, Barney, I can't
stand all these jokes
about me crying.

280
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,410
If I pretend to reveal that
you were the one who cried,
will you go along with it?

281
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,108
Sure.

282
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,316
(SIGHING)
I made a mistake
letting you go, didn't I?

283
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,751

Dude, you almost had us.

286
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,719
You always take it
one too far.

287
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,187
Damn it.

288
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,226
All right, good news.
I think we'll be out
of here early.

289
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,731
Really?
Yep.

290
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,073
I finished
downstairs and the outside.

291
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,569
Now, I could keep looking
and see what else I can find,

292
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:18,611
besides the black mold,
the damaged retaining wall,
the frayed electrical wires,

293
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,238
the lead paint,
the water damage,

294
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,883
the fire damage,
the sun damage,

295
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,909
the broken furnace,
the rotted floorboards...

296
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,014
Hey, look at that,
no termites.
Ooh.

297
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:28,176
The cracked chimney,
the bats, the rats,
the spiders,

298
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,245
the raccoons, the hobo,
the detached gutter,

299
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,424
the outdated fuse box and the
paint job in the kitchen,
which is fine,

300
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,964
but the trim really
clashes with the countertops.

301
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,790
Or I could just recommend

302
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:42,156
that you do not
buy this godforsaken
Guantanamo Bay of a house,

303
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,095
and suggest that we all
get our asses out of here

304
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,501
before a medium-sized wind
blows the whole sumbitch down.

he found a hobo?

Okay, yes.
There are problems.

But I see this house
for what I know it can be.

I see a swing on
that tree outside.

I see a wreath on the
front door at Christmas,

315
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,943
I see a grill
out on that patio,

316
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,209
where I'll be
barbecuing every weekend.

317
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,308
I see a life that I
know I can have here.

00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,909
Just want to make sure
the report is thorough.

327

(CLICKING TONGUE)
Oh, you were right.

328
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:06,206
This was a huge mistake.
It's just...

329
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,046
Everyone's moving on but me.
You guys got a place
years ago.

330
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,682
Robin's getting
serious with Don.

331
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,388
Barney, maybe,
that's a new tie?

332
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,920
Thank you. Jeez.

333
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:18,163
Now, my mom's remarried.

334
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,931
I'm exactly where
I was five years ago.

335
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,201
I'm sick of it. I'm...

336
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,500
I'm ready for the life
that fits into this house.

337
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,067
That's all right, buddy.

338
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,943
Sometimes, people make
the wrong decisions
in life.

339
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,377
Like your mother.

340
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,683
What do you mean?

341
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:43,551
Ted, as you know,
I've always been very,
