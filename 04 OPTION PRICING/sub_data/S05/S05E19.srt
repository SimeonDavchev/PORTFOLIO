OLDER TED: Kids,
you may be wondering
how many of these stories

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:05,305
I'm telling you are true.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,039
It's a fair question.

4
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:12,475
After all, there's a fine line
between a good story and
a bald-faced lie.

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,823
I never met anyone
who could work that line
better than your Uncle Barney.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,389
Heck, he could
jump rope with it.

7
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,048
I love to
travel myself.

8
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:20,287
Really?
Hmm.

9
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:21,691
Where's the best
place you've visited?

10
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,722
Hawaii's nice.

11
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,587
A buddy of mine
lives in Seattle,
that's a good spot.

12
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,757
But the best place,
I'd have to say
the moon.

13
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,297
Hi, Neil Armstrong.

14
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,373
No! You did not
convince a girl you were the
first man to walk on the moon!

15
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,544
That happened seven years
before you were born.

16
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,482
Ted, baby doll, minor hurdle.

17
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:45,149
Oh, yeah, our spaceship
passed through a wormhole

18
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,579
or some gamma
rays or something.

19
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,345
I started
aging backwards,
blah, blah, blah.

20
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,854
So, you work
in a yogurt shop,
that must be wild.

22
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:58,492
Although, I did actually
work in a yogurt store
in high school.

23
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:02,426
And it was indeed wild.

24
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:06,633
Anywho, 20 minutes later,
the eagle landed.

25
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,237
We knocked space boots.

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,140

related double entendres.

28
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:17,707
Why do you feel
the need to lie
all the time?

29
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,105
I'm not lying!

30
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:20,577
Guys, we made sweet love.

31
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:21,424

What are you
talking about?

36
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:29,786
I thought you just
interviewed the mayor.

37
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,763
Mayor McWoof.

38
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,732
He wears a dog costume,
and teaches kids
not to litter.

39
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,801
At least
he's supposed to.

40
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,529
I don't want to
talk about Mayor McWoof.

41
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:42,766
I want to talk about these
amazing insoles from
Bon Appe-Feet!

42
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,713
Just look how
shock absorbent they are!

Oh! Sorry, Robin.
Got bored.

47

Yeah, I don't blame you.

48
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:05,264
Man, just one
decent interview would
be so nice for a change.

49
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,793
Fine. I'll look at
my schedule,

50
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,297
see when I'm available.

51
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,929
But I want a list of
questions ahead of time,

52
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,333
and my personal
life is off limits.

53
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,266
Ted, you caught
seven peanuts
in a row.

54
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,602
It's impressive but
it's not newsworthy.

55
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,337
You caught seven in a row?

56
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,242
Seven in a row.
Whoa!

57

But that's not
what I'm talking about.

58
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,505
No, I'm talking about
how I was selected to

59
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,575
build a scale model of
the Empire State Building,

60
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:31,385
for the largest re-creation
of the New York skyline in
the world.

61

Is that the thing you were
playing with the other night?

62
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,717
I wasn't playing.
I was working.

63

"I saw you in the street."

00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,496
"Yes."

Ted?

67
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:51,637
Are you acting out
the last scene of Sleepless
in Seattle with little dolls?

68
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,272
How long have
you been out here?

69
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,877
Ten seconds.
Yeah. Just the last scene.

70
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,777
Oh, Ted. Again?

71

You know, I don't...
I actually...

74
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,364
I don't think that
I should have to pay,

75
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,360

a fan of pizza.

78
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,498
Marshall,
we've driven halfway

79
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,771
across the country
for a piece of pizza,
literally, hundreds of times.

80
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,669
I once caught you
eating pizza in
the shower.

81
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,512
Marshall,
there's a cartoon
of you on our coupons.

82
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,808
I'm not saying
Marshall's a guy
who likes pizza,

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,680
but last time he went in
for a physical, doctor says,

84
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,609
"Marshall, you got
to stop eating pizza."
Marshall says, "Why?"

85
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,014
Doc says,
"So I can examine you."

86
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,345
But seriously,
we kid because we love.

87
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:37,692
All right, look, the reason
that I don't have any money
on me

88
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,818
is because

89
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:42,018
I got mugged.

Better.

Oh, my God!
You got mugged?

95
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,979
Who mugged you?

96
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,815
Was he wearing
a black skull-knit cap
and a five o'clock shadow?

97
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,850
Did he say,
"Stick them up"?
Yes, Barney,

98
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,985
because I got mugged in 1947,
at the corner of Abbott
and Costello.

99
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,633
No. I was cutting
through Central Park
on my way home from work.

it was a gun?

170
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,220
No, guys.
I was walking
home from work,

171
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:40,234
through Central Park,
and I stopped at the zoo.

172
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,801
Watch it.
Don't get any closer.

173
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,643
Oh! It's cool. It's cool.

174
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,200
(MONKEY CHATTERING)

175
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,853
You're telling us...

176
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,912
That you got mugged...

177
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,048
By a monkey.

178
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,953
I got mugged by a monkey.

179
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,263
(ALL LAUGHING)

180
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,598
You got mugged by a monkey?

181
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,031
Yep. I got
mugged by a monkey.

182
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,537
I was embarrassed,
so I made up the
other story.

183
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,640
But the point is,
Lily, you don't
need a gun.

184
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:25,942
(LAUGHING)
Forget about the gun.

185
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,113
We're on this now.

186
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,110
Wow, monkeys are
mugging people now?

187
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,812
It really is
a jungle out there.

188
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,214
(GASPING) Oh, my God.

189
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,915
That monkey
has our address.
What if he's in a gang?

190
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:38,988
I hope
he doesn't
do a swing by.

191
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,059
Why didn't you
just ask the zookeeper
to get your wallet back?

192
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,789
'Cause I saw
what the monkey
was doing with it,

193
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,634
and I didn't really
want it after that.

194
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,029
Hey, guys.
What's up?

195
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,202
Oh! Some new information
has come to light on
Marshall's mugging.

196
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,102
Oh, really?
Did they catch the guy?

197
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:54,904
Well, he's behind bars.

198
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,067
Well, where did they
find him?

199
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,575
I'm guessing
naked in a tree,
throwing his own feces.

200
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:04,879
Oh. I've seen that guy.
See, that's why I take cabs.

201
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,282
You know how they
caught him, right?

202
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,248
There was a tail on him.
There was a tail on him!

203
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,688
Okay, what is going on?

204
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,861
All right, Robin,
here's what happened.

205
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,689
No, no, no, no, no.
Let me tell it.
It's my story.

206
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:23,057
You see, young
Marshall was at the
zoo, eating a banana.

207
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,366
No, I wasn't eating a banana.
If you're gonna tell it,
tell it right.

208
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,101
You're right.
The banana was
on the ground.

209
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,987
There was no banana.

210
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,659
There was no...
There was no banana.

211
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,358
Marshall, I apologize.
Truly.

212
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,288
Robin, here's what happened.

213
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,155
(MONKEY CHATTERING)

214
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,764
Oh, God.
Oh, God, don't shoot.

215
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,067
There was no banana!

216
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,069
Come on, Barney.
I know Marshall didn't
get mugged by a monkey.

217
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,600
Marshall?

218
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:06,709
That part he got right.

219
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,840
What?

220
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,176
Guys, this is not
an uncommon thing, okay?

221
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,681
In Thailand, in China,
in Costa Rica,

222
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,875
people get mugged
by monkeys all the time.

223
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,687
Monkeys are gatherers.
Because of their
inter-social dynamics,

224
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,920
having a predisposition
towards stealing

225
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,115
gives one
a genetic advantage.

226
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,357
You were mugged
by a monkey.

227
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:31,104
Maybe he was just curious.
Were you wearing a yellow hat?

228
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,431
Marshall,
in all seriousness,
this is a great story.

229
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,166
I mean,
can I interview you
about it on my show?

230
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,242
What? He gets
to be on your show?
What about my model?

231
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,871
No one wants to see a guy
come on my show and play
with dolls.

232
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,678
Okay, first of all,
that is not what it is.

233
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,151
And second of all,
you just had a guy

234
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,108
on your show
playing with dolls.

235
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,717
So, your dolls
are favored to win

236
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,979
at the Rhinebeck Collector
Awards next month.

237
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,688
Only if they
behave themselves.

238
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,460
Last year,
I found one of them
cavorting with a G.I. Joe.

239
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,418
(LAUGHING)

240
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,786
It's not funny.

241
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:03,026
What were you thinking?
What if you'd gotten
pregnant?

242
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,273
And you invited him back
for a follow-up interview!

243
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,068
Only because the FBI
asked us to keep him
occupied

244
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,301
while they
searched his house.

245
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,867
Come on, Marshall,
I need the story.

246
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,406
It's got everything.

247
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,012
Crime,
monkeys, no stupid model
of the Empire State Building

248
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,305
that takes up my
entire living room

249
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,116
and makes the whole
place smell like glue.

250
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,089
Come on.
Do this for me, as a friend.

251
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,918
It'd be fun
to see you on TV.

252
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:27,894
Yeah.

253
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:32,761
Okay, can you promise
to present it in a way

254
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,363
that doesn't make
a joke out of the fact

255
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,804
that I got
mugged by a monkey?

256
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,230
You got mugged
by a monkey.

257
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,772
Oh, my God!
I just got mugged!

258
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,035
What?
Is what I was saying

259
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,883
to this girl at
the bar earlier.

260
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,209
It was completely terrifying.

261
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,154
I just want to
forget this ever happened

262
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,020
and try to move
on with my life.

263
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,818
Oh, you poor thing.

264
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,250
Neil?

265
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,845
Neil?
I...

266
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:00,387
Neil?
I...

267
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,990
Neil!

268
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,462
Lady, my name's not Neil.

269
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,930
It's Ba... (GAGGING)

270
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,358
Why are you calling him Neil?

271
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,233
Because that's his name.
He's Neil Armstrong.

272
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,532
The cyclist?

273
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,304
I thought you
were supposed to be
on a shuttle mission.

274
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,943
I thought you
just got mugged.

275
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,940
Okay, I can do this.
You see,

276
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:26,113
I was on my way
to the launch pad
when I was mugged.

277
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:30,546
And the mugger took
my space shuttle keys.

278
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,553
Nailed it.
Who's up for
a three-way?

279
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,315
I am!
Me, too!

280
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,564
(CHUCKLING)

281
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,328
And it was
the best three-way ever.

282
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,829
Strange, 'cause you look like
you just had two vodka tonics
thrown in your face.

283
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,763
You have
lime in your hair.

284
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:52,244
The story's better
with my ending...
Just... Okay?

285
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,182
So, there we are,
zero gravity.

286
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,378
The three of us wearing
nothing but space helmets.

287
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,380
ROBIN: Marshall.
And I...

288
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,911
You won't believe it.

289
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,318
I pitched
the monkey mugger
story to my producer,

290
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,349
and he loves it!

291
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,893
Oh! Wow.

292
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,119
Yeah. Yeah.
Really? Cool.

293
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,885
I mean,
who's ever heard of a guy
getting mugged by a monkey?

294
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,393
No one, except
for the good people

295
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,925
of Thailand,
China, Costa Rica, and
plenty of other countries

296
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,603
where monkey crime is
an extremely common nuisance.

297
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,901
Well, the best part is,
he said that it might get
picked up to go national.

298
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,535
Guys, this
monkey mugger story
could make me famous.

299
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,406
Me, too.

300
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,309
(STAMMERING) Guys, this
is bad. I can't do this.

301
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,305
So it'll be a little
embarrassing. So what?

302
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,276
It's not that.

303
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,075
Guys,

304
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,318
(WHISPERING)
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.

305
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,588
So, you weren't
mugged by a monkey?

306
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,527
No, I wasn't.

307
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,532
So, what you're saying is,

308
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,574
the monkey tricked you
into giving him your wallet?

309
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,641
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

310
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,038
So, you mugged the monkey?

311
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,171
Guys, there was no monkey!
It was a human being
with a gun.

312
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,583
Are you sure it
wasn't one monkey

313
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,422
standing on
another monkey's shoulders
wearing a men's trench coat?

314
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,948
Be about the right height.

315
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,023
No! I...

316
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,152
I just made that story up
so that Lily wouldn't get
a gun.

317
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,017
The truth is that
it never happened.

318
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,559
I don't buy it!

319
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,091
What?
You heard me.

320
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,657
I think you were
mugged by a monkey.

321
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,534
You just don't want
to go on Robin's show,

322
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,133
'cause you're afraid
it'll make you look
like a big joke.

323
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:25,965
Well, won't it?

324
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,969
The biggest
'cause it's so funny.

325
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,042
Well, it never
happened, okay?

326
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,011
And I can lie to you guys
about it, because you're
my best friends.

327
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,370
I am, but go on.

328
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,937
But I can't
lie about it
on national TV.

329
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,212
Ted, you've
known him the longest.
Is he telling the truth?

330
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,386
Ted, don't.

331
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,362
I can't tell.

332
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,628
He smells good.

333
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,965
I just can't tell.

334
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,673
Well, I'm still
saying it happened.

335
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,975
Maybe. But, Marshall, if you
didn't get mugged by a monkey,

336
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,410
you can't let Robin
report it on her show.

337
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,714
I mean, this could
hurt her credibility.

338
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,245
Oh, please. Journalists
lie all the time.

339
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,352
I'm sorry,
but I will believe that

340
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,594
Jack Palance is dead
when I see the body.

341
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,320
Okay, this may come
as a shock to you,
Barney,

342
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,115
but people don't
like to be lied to.

343
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:27,387
Wrong.
They don't like finding
out they've been lied to.

344
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,027
"Because a lie is
just a great story

345
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,203
"that someone ruined with
the truth." Barney Stinson.

346
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,643
Case in point,
what that girl
Sarah did to me.

347
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,069
You mean what you did to her.

348
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:41,065
No. I mean
what she did to me.

349
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,608
The truth is,
I'm afraid the
three-way story

350
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,583
didn't go exactly as
I said it did.

351
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,712
Nailed it.
Who's up for
a three-way?

352
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,191
Lisa, wait.

353
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,089
Yes, Neil?

354
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:54,751
You're Lisa?

355
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,217
Sarah, wait.

356
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,025
Look,

357
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm not Neil Armstrong.

358
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:05,099
I'm sorry I lied.

359
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:09,602
Well, I guess I wasn't
completely honest with
you either.

360
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,336
I mean, I said that I was 28,
but the truth is that I'm
really 31.

361
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,443
And if
we're being
completely honest,

362
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,045
I went to the doctor the
other day and found out...

363
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,018
Thirty-one!
I was happy, very happy,

364
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,520
thinking that I had
nailed a 28-year-old
with some sun damage.

365
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:31,594
People want
the lie, Marshall.
They need the lie,

366
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,264
which is why,
as far as I'm concerned,
you were mugged by a monkey.

367
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,265
Just as sure as I
had that three-way.

368
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:41,368
I am
the greatest
in the world!

369
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,741
(CHUCKLING)

370
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,799
Barney,
is that the
three-way belt?

371
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,367
You know it.
Props!

372
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,441
Man, I slept
so great last night.

373
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,348
(SIGHS)
Can you believe
I almost bought a gun?

374
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,351
I'm so glad you got
mugged by a monkey.

375
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:02,556
Okay, you guys got me.

376
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,659
I was just nervous.
I got mugged by a monkey.

377
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,532
Yes! I knew it!

378
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,359
Wait a minute.

379
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:11,255
Now I'm thinking
you really weren't
mugged by a monkey.

380
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,268
Come on, Ted.
Why would he make
something like that up?

381
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,500
Yeah, come on, Ted.

382
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,135
Come here.

383
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,379
Okay, seriously,
what is that cologne?

384
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,381
It's intoxicating.

385
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,620
OLDER TED: So, late
the following night,

386
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,648
we all went to
the set of Robin's show.

387
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,253
Okay, Marshall,
now, don't be nervous.

388
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,215
What we're going to do is,
we're going to sit you...

389
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,123
What the hell is this?

390
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,385
I don't know.

391
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,563
Looks like something
covered by a sheet.

392
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,131
Guess if you
want to find out,

393
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,660
you're gonna have
to do a story on it.

394
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,164
You're gonna be
covered by a sheet

395
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,756
if you don't
get your stupid
model out of here.

396
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,439
Dude, what are you doing?

397
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,668
I don't think Marshall's
going to lie on TV.

398
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,473
And when he backs out,

399
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,835
I want to be there for
my friend Robin with
a story.

400
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:58,554
Or rather, 102 stories,
because that's how tall

401
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,378
a certain iconic
New York landmark is.

402
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,354
Now, I want to buy a gun.

403
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,653
Whoa, the monkey's here.

404
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,585
Surprise.
We thought it would help
the story to bring him here

405
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,460
so you could
face your attacker.

406
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,789
Yeah, because
of this incident,

407
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,694
we will be
sending Captain Bobo
to a wildlife sanctuary.

408
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,757
Ooh! I bet
he'll like it there.

409
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:21,466
No, ma'am. You see,
we'll be splitting him
up from his mate Milly.

410
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,801
They've
been together
for a long time.

411
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,211
His mate's name is Milly?

412
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,810
OLDER TED:
And then the
interview began.

413
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,911
Marshall,
in your own words,
describe what happened.

414
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,284
Well, I would...

415
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,884
I... I would
love to tell you
what happened, Robin.

416
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,889
But...

417
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,488
I'm just...
I'm so curious as to

418
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,720
what is going on
underneath that sheet.

419
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,385
Well, we're not here
to talk about that.

420
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,594
We're here to talk
about your mugging.

421
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,856
Right. Well, people get
mugged in New York City
all the time, Robin.

422
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:53,195
But how often
do you get to see
whatever's under that sheet?

423
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:53,733
Mike, can we get
a shot of that?

424
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:54,626
We'll be right back.

425
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,667
We're clear.

426
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,842
What the hell
are you doing?

427
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,840
Okay, Robin, I wasn't
really mugged by
a monkey, okay?

428
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,643
I just made up that story
so that Lily wouldn't buy
a gun.

429
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,605
So, you weren't
mugged by a monkey?

430
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,484
No, what are you
talking about, baby?

431
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:06,482
Of course I was
mugged by a monkey.

432
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:09,323
Great. Tell it to America.
We're back in five.

433
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,179
No. No.
No. Not back in five.
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.

434
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,948
Okay, that's it.
I'm getting a gun.

435
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,645
No, no. Don't get a gun.
I was mugged by a monkey.

436
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,257
Well, then,
Bobo here is going away.

437
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,289
Wasn't. I wasn't
mugged by a monkey.

438
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,525
Ted, do you have any idea
if Marshall was mugged by
a monkey?

439
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,689
None whatsoever.
Just tell me,

440
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,728
were you or were you not
mugged by Captain Bobo?

441
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,603
Yeah, baby,
just tell us
what really happened.

442
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,902
Yeah, Marshall,
just tell us the truth.

443
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:27,573
Come on, you promised.

444
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,900
(ALL CLAMORING)

445
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,941
OLDER TED:
And that's when
Marshall realized

446
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,672
there was only one
thing he could say.

447
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:35,607
All right.

448
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:37,813
Here's the truth.

449
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:39,678
I...

450
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,449
am going back to bed.

451
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,654
OLDER TED: And that was it.

452
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,686
We never found out
what really happened to
Uncle Marshall's wallet.

453
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,962
But we do know this.
Aunt Lily never got
a gun.

454
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,932
Aunt Robin's credibility
remained unimpeached.

455
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,372
And Bobo and Milly lived out
their days together in the
Central Park Zoo.

456
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,569
(SIGHING) Damn it.

457
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,644
All right, Ted, mike up.

458
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,940
Miked up and made up.
Red leather, yellow leather.

459
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:10,484
That wasn't
very satisfying.

460
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,840
When I tell everyone
at work this story,

461
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,278
I'm saying he was
mugged by a monkey.

462
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,954
And I'm gonna keep
the banana-on-a-string
thing. That was working.

463
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,822
Barney, enough with the lies.

464
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,550
You can't just tack on
a new ending

465
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,616
because you're
not satisfied with
how a story wraps up.

466
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:26,934
Oh, really? Well,
mark my words, Mosby.

467
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,429
Someday, you'll
be telling this story,
and you'll see it my way.

468
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,133
Doubtful.

469
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,774
OLDER TED: And then, kids,
you'll never believe what
happened.

470
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,870
The monkey got loose.

471
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,609
He's got one of my dolls!

00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,284
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

474
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,239
He's climbing the building.

475
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,054
Bobo, come here.

476
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,850
I'll get him.

477
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,321
Is this really happening?

478
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,427
Sure is, Ted.
