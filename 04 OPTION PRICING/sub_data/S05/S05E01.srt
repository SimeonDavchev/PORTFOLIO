OLDER TED:
Kids, on my first day
as a college professor,

2
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:15,124
there were two things
I didn't know that
I wish I did.

3
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,119
The first thing
was that your mother
was in that classroom.

4
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:22,959
The second thing?

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,330
Well, to explain that,
we have to go back to

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,959
the beginning
of the summer,

7
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,634
when, after a year
of wrestling with their
feelings for each other,

8
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:33,803
Barney and Robin
finally, well...

9
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,304
Whoo!

10
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,906
Lily, volume.
Use your indoor "whoo."

11
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,368
Sorry. (SOFTLY) Whoo.

12
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:42,177
It's just they kissed!
They're finally a couple.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,980
(GASPING) Oh, my God,
you guys.

14
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,411
This is our first
double date!

15
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,877
First of millions!
What if our kids
get married?

16
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,046
Oh, I love this!

17
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,824
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,252
Lily, listen.

19
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,517
Barney's awesome.

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,426
Robin's more
than just awe "some."
She's awe "quite a bit."

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,900
She's awe
"a whole darn lot."

but we'll totally still
be friends.

Oh, yeah.

27
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:12,114
Is it something I did?

28
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,740
Oh, no. No, no, no. God, no.
Lily, it's not you. It's us.

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,006
Yeah. It's us.

We were gonna take
cooking lessons together,

34
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,426
and we were gonna go
on camping trips together,

35
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,799
and then we were gonna sit
around telling funny stories

36
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,268
about our
cooking lessons
and our camping trips.

the summer went by
way too fast.

the Friday before my first day
as a college professor.

it's weird.

about smoking in here?

00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,619
I just thought of a reason.

173
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,856
OLDER TED: The next night,
Robin and Brad went to
a hockey game.

174
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,926
You're probably wondering
why I've been quiet
all night.

175
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,096
Um...

176
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,144
Damn it, Hordichuk!
You miss another
gimme like that,

177
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,510
I'm gonna come down there
and put a slapper right
up your beerhole!

178
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,140
Come on!

179
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,714
Not really.

180
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,214
The truth is, I feel kind
of weird being out with you.

181
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,313
Oh, man.

182
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,178
Is this the talk?
What?

183
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,986
No, this is good.
Let's get it all
out of the way.

184
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,159
Robin, I'm looking
for something serious.

185
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,718
No, Brad, no, it's...

186
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,157
But before we
go any further,

187
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,931
you should know something
about my stuff below the belt.

188
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,061
I was born
a little different.

189
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,996
God, no. Brad, no.

190
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,272
This is about me and Barney.
You and...

191
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,872
Oh! So, you guys are...

192
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,714
Well, we don't know
what we are.

193
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,639
I mean, my heart says,
"Leap into it."

194
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,835
My brain says,
"It's a bad idea."

195
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,777
Sounds like you guys
need to have the talk.

196
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,682
We're not gonna have the talk!

197
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,084
Would you just
have the talk, okay?

198
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,216
It's a five-minute
conversation, and then you
get to have sex afterwards.

199
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,962
It's great!
Back me up, Ted.

200
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,319
I don't think
the talk is necessary.

201
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,216
(HIGH-PITCHED) What?

202
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,927
Thank you, Ted.

203
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,199
Because Robin is
already his girlfriend.

204
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,658
(HIGH-PITCHED) What?

205
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,727
MacLaren's Bar,
four years ago.

206
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,136
How do you keep a girl
from becoming your girlfriend?

207
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,338
Simple, the rules for girls
are the same as the rules
for Gremlins.

208
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,111
Gremlins?
Gremlins.

209
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,110
Rule number one,
never get them wet.

210
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,683
In other words,
don't let her take
a shower at your place.

211
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,823
Number two, keep
them away from sunlight,

212
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,848
i.e. don't ever see
them during the day.

213
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,654
And rule number three,
never feed them
after midnight,

214
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:17,057
meaning she doesn't sleep over
and you don't have breakfast
with her.

215
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,730
Ever.

216
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,829
What about brunch?
Is brunch cool?

217
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,299
No, Ted, brunch is not cool.

218
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,996
Okay, new topic.
How do I pick a tie?

219
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,866
Simple. Remember in
the movie, Predator...

220
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,275
I've done all three of
those things with Robin.

221
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,908
Is she my girlfriend?

222
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,776
Just once, I wish you guys
would call me on Tuxedo Night.

223
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,551
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

224
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,755
time to pucker up for the
New York Rangers Kiss Cam!

225
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,990
CROWD:
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

226
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,234
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

227
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,830
Okay, how about this?

228
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,001
If you kiss me and
you feel bad about it,

229
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,059
you're meant to be
with Barney.

230
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,067
(SIGHS) Why not?
Lay it on me.

231
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,343
Hey, Brad.

232
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,082
Brad, we can't fight
like this all night!

233
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,281
We both got
some good shots in.
Let's call a truce!

234
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,954
It's okay, dude.

235
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,993
I shouldn't go kissing
some other guy's girlfriend.

236
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:21,048
BARNEY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Girlfriend? Hey, come on.

237
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,058
That's putting it
a bit strongly. Okay.

238
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,830
A bit strongly.
She's not my girlfriend.

239
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:28,528
Yeah. A girlfriend's
a bit much, Brad,
okay? We...

240
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,801
Okay, seriously.
We're at the point
of physical violence.

241
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,103
Now, will you
please have the talk?

242
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,505
Because of that? Come on.
That's my thing.

243
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,038
I'm always
punching guys, girls.

244
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,144
I'll punch a baby.
I don't care.

245
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,908
OLDER TED: Finally,
my first class had arrived.

246
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,377
For real this time.

247
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,275
I knew I had to make
a strong impression.

248
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,217
I had thought of
everything. Except...

249
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,793
TED: Wait.
Does professor
have one "F" or two?

250
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,893
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

251
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:02,055
Professor. Professor.
They're all staring at me.

252
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,025
Professor. I don't know.
Just do something!

253
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,944
Two "F's".

254
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,039
That looks right.
I think that's right.

255
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,417
Hey, sorry I went
a little too far
last night.

256
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,586
Look, we've been over this.

257
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,793
Unless I say "flugelhorn,"
you haven't gone too far.

258
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,304
No, I meant punching Brad.

259
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,629
Right. Look, don't even
worry about it. It's... Oh!

260
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,366
God. The doorknob's
broken off.

261
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,342
We're locked in here.
Did you do this?

262
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,671
No.

263
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,305
Flugelhorn. Did you do this?

264
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,880
No.

265
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,640
Ted.

266
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,908
Ted, are you out there?

267
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,546
Ted's not here, Robin.

268
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,482
Lily, let us out of here.

269
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,216
I'd be glad to.

270
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,491
Just as soon as you
and Barney have the talk.

271
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,856
Lily! Come on. Let us out!

272
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,226
No. Sit down,
define the relationship,

273
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,835
write down
that definition
on a piece of paper,

274
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,608
slip it under the door and
if I like what I read,
you can go.

275
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,538
We are not having the talk!

276
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,343
Then you'll die in there.

277
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,035
You're gonna
lock us in here?
Well, guess what?

278
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,847
Maybe we'll spend the
whole day having sex!

279
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,620
Well, guess what?

280
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:32,218
I brought Marshall with me,
so maybe we'll do the same.

Hey, guys.

282
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,786
OLDER TED: I still
hadn't decided what kind
of professor I wanted to be.

283
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,626
Authoritative or cool guy.

284
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:45,571
I thought I would
decide in the moment.
And I did, about 20 times.

Do not call me T-Dawg.

my crossroads moment.

00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,936
What kind of professor
was I gonna be?

298
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,905
I had to decide.

until the end of the lecture.
Thank you!

was not your mom.

Wait, let me finish this
real quick.

306
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,828
Here's what that
girl would have said.

307
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,731
I'm sorry to bother you,
Professor Mosby,

that's kind of funny, Lily.

00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,037
Not good enough.

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,570

the slightest inclination

my time and yours.

359
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:26,624
Economics 305 has
been taught right here
in Building 14, Room 7.

360

Yeah, buddy, I'm sure
200 architecture students

361
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:33,227

all got the room wrong.

That's rough.

Yeah, but
here's the funny thing.

369
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,790
By that point, I didn't
have time to think about

370
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,562
what kind of teacher
I was going to be.

371
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:08,101
I just got up there and
talked about architecture.

372
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,298
And it was kind of great.

373
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,032

had a girlfriend
for a long time.

I hope
that doesn't
make you mad.

Mad?

I suck at relationships.

Man. He really got it right.

but he really ruined
me for other men.

I wasn't in the room
for this conversation,

405
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,147
but I have to imagine
Robin said something
like that.

406
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,751
Maybe we should go back
to being just friends.

407
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,853
Maybe.

stop having sex.

isn't gonna work.

at being friends,

being in a relationship.

the whole summer lying
about being just friends.

Really?
Yeah. Really.

but it feels good to say.

We're both
afraid of commitment,

426
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,230
but the fact is,
we also can't live
without each other.

427

And if the alternative
is not being together,

428

taking this risk 'cause
