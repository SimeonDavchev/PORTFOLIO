00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:04,409
OLDER TED: Kids, on a warm
March evening in 2010,

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,438
a New York City Police boat
pulled a 34-year-old
white male

3
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:08,784
out of the Hudson River,
your Uncle Barney.

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,209
All right, kid,
let's hear the story,

5
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,575
from the beginning.

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,123
Well, it all started
a week ago.

7
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,249
I was making time at
the local watering hole.

8
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:21,256
Enter, a dame.

9
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:32,497
Nothing sexier than
a man in a fine cravat.

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,373
Except for a woman
who appreciates
a fine cravat.

11
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,368
How about we
just call it a tie?

12
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,111
(BOTH LAUGHING)

13
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,107
(LAUGHING)

14
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:46,346
You see,
a cravat is
a kind of tie.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,350
I get it.

16
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:52,122
Anyway, next thing you know,
I get her back to my place.

17
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:56,863
Barney, when
I get in bed with a man,
my body becomes a machine,

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,360
fueled by desire and lust

19
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:05,303
and a singular
hunger to satisfy
my lover's every carnal need.

20
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,803
Good thing the
cleaning lady's
coming tomorrow.

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,110
Well, good night.

22
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:13,739
What? Wait, what?

23
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:17,484
I thought your body was gonna
become a machine, fueled by
desire, lust,

24
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,511
and a singular
hunger to satisfy
my every carnal need?

25
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:21,848
No.

26
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,031
(ALL LAUGHING)

27
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,196
You know, I really think that
Don and I are hitting our
stride as a news team.

28
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,235
Yeah.
Well, all credit goes

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,270
to this lady on my left.

30
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,274
Well, come on.

31
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,206
That story you
did on which rodents
to avoid on the subway...

32
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,281
The answer
may surprise you.

33
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,578
It's all of them.

34
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,623
I got to run, okay?
Okay.

35
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:55,348
LILY: Well, bye.
I'll see you.
It's good to meet you.

36
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,883
Yeah, you too.
Okay. Bye, Don.

37
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,247
(SIGHS)

38
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,787
Okay, Robin,
that guy is awesome.

39
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:04,332
He's funny.
He's smart. He's handsome.

40
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,158
You got to scoop him up
before someone else does.

41
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:07,864
I hope you're not
talking about you?

42
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,225
It has been four months
since you broke up
with Barney.

43
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,365
Maybe it's time
to put yourself
back out there.

44
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,901
Yeah, exactly.
Barney's dating again,
and he couldn't be happier.

45
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,506
I couldn't
be more unhappy.

46
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,809
All night long,
she's hot and heavy for me.

47
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,311
I get her back to my place,
and she just bolts?

48
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,354
I mean, at least,
when I run out on a girl,

49
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,319
I have
the common courtesy
to sleep with her first.

50
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,779
It's called manners.

51
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,547
Sounds like
she read that book,

52
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,415
Of Course
You're Still Single.

53
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,394
Take a Look at Yourself,
You Dumb Slut.

54
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,490
Well, it...
It's this book that helps
single girls find a husband.

55
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,962
It's Robin's copy.
I've just...

56
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,226
I've leafed through it
a little bit.

57
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,325
Is that right? Well...
Really?

58
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,337
Men Are From Mars...

59
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,969
Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine!

60
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,914
Barney, when you
were with this girl,

61
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,511
did she suddenly
slip the word "sex"
into the conversation?

62
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:01,515
I'm in the inter-sex-tion,
and I only have a couple
of sex,

63
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,949
before the light changes.
Anyway, everyone's
honking at me.

64
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:09,785
And it totally sex.
But, I can't turn around,
because a jogger slipped

65
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,663
and fell in
horse sex-crement.

66
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,303
Go on. Go on.

67
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,270
Did she make
excuses to establish
physical contact with you?

68
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,933
Is this cashmere?

69
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,638
Cashmere?

70
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,640
(SCOFFS) This is
hand spun virgin Merino.

71
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:30,243
The fibers in this suit are
less than 12 microns thick.

72
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,548
Twelve microns?

73
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,616
I love a tiny fiber.

74
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,649
Well, you're in luck.
'Cause mine's the tiniest.

75
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:43,287
And the more you touch it,
the softer it gets.

76
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,289
(MOANS)

77
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,828
She did that, too!

78
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,433
Now, here's the final test.

79
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,696
Next time you see her,
ask her out for the
following night.

80
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,865
The book says
that's forbidden.

81
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,514
So, she'll probably
give you some lame excuse,

82
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,710
like this, "Oh, I can't
do anything tomorrow tonight,

83
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,753
"I've already made plans
to clean my garbage disposal

84
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,478
"and treat myself
to a bubble bath.

85
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,384
"But how about
next week some time?"

86
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,686
Aha! You're trying that,
Of Course You're Still Single.

87
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,849
Take a Look at Yourself,
You Dumb Slut crap on me!

88
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,557
It's not crap!

89
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,529
Of Course
You're Still Single.

90
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,688
Take a Look at Yourself,
You Dumb Slut
is a brilliant book.

91
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:23,327
And, it scares away guys
who are only interested
in getting laid.

92
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,934
Why not just say
you have a kid?

93
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,596
You'd be surprised how
many jerks there are
out there.

94
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,766
That's why the book says,
"Never sleep with a guy
on the first date."

95
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,344
Totally.
"Or the second date."

96
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,743
Of course.
"Or the third date."

97
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,884
Well...
"Or the fourth date."

98
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,378
Would you tell me
how many dates?

99
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,380
Seventeen.
(STUTTERS)

100
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,615
Excuse me,
is anyone using this?

101
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,358
(EXHALES)

102
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:51,488
Yep. Here it is.
"No sex until after 17 dates."

103
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,785
Barney, if
you're not gonna
take her out on 17 dates,

104
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,827
I think
you should
just give it up.

105
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,732
ROBIN: Hmm.

106
00:04:56,764 --> 00:05:00,774
Oh, no. I'm not the one
who's gonna give it up,
she is.

107
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,501
Because thanks
to Ted's book...

108
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,836
That's Robin's.
It's Robin's book.

109
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,771
...I can stay two steps
ahead of her at all times.

110
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,007
There's a loophole in here
somewhere, and I'm gonna
find it.

111
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,042
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

112
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,709
Hello?
Hey, Robin.

113
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,576
Oh, hey, Don.

114
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,915
Listen, do you want
to go out Saturday night?

115
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,891
Saturday night?

116
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,449
Is he asking you out?

117
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,888
Say yes! Say yes!

118
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,062
Look, Don, listen,

119
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,031
it's really
sweet of you to ask.

120
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,530
And you're a great guy.

121
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,033
Yes, I'll go out with you.

122
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,404
Robin, are you okay?

123
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,974
Um, I just
have a little cold.

124
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,802
That's probably
what you're hearing.

125
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,107
But Saturday
night sounds great.

126
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,108
We can even go
to a steak house.

127
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,380
And you can bring
home some prime rib
for my friend Marshall.

128
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,711
Okay, got to go.
Love you, bye.

129
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,546
What the hell
are you thinking?

130
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:52,391
Robin, you've
got to do this, okay?
A great guy like Don is rare.

131
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,090
And speaking
of rare, prime rib.
Don't forget. Thank you.

132
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,131
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it!

133
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:07,901
Guys, this is her!
She wrote the book!

134
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:12,105
Huh. Her name must be Anita.
Okay, my plan was to sleep
with her.

135
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,079
But this changes everything.

136
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,848
New plan,
I'm going to
sleep with her.

137
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,145
Boy, this girl that
Barney's going after,

138
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,124
she kind of sounds
like the anti-Barney.

139
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:30,094
I love how
the universe decided
to bring those two together.

140
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,863
Actually, Anita's going
after Barney because
I told her to.

141
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,103
Wait, you sicced
Anita on Barney?

142
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,565
How do you
even know her?

143
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,514
She was on my show.

144
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,979
But, um, if you had
to summarize your book,

145
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,538
in 30 words or less.

146
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,578
I'll summarize it
in one word, Robin.

147
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,053
And that word is "no."

148
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,152
By saying "no" constantly
and consistently,

149
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:02,485
you empower yourself
while simultaneously
turning any jerk

150
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,133
into a submissive,
sniveling, puddle
of a man.

151
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,858
Hmm. And isn't that
every girl's dream.

152
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,725
(CHUCKLES) After the break,
we're gonna talk about
your new book,

153
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,904
Of Course
You Don't Have
a Retirement Plan Yet.

154
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,943
Take a Look at Yourself,
You Dumb Slut.

155
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,968
Due out in June.
We'll be right back.

156
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,541
MIKE: We're clear.

157
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:20,713
You guys want any coffee?
Thank you.

158
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,981
Oh, you know what,
Mike, that'd be great.

159
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,109
You?

160
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,083
No.

161
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,218
What about you, Robin?
You dating anyone?

162
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:33,119
Oh. Dating's not
really my bag right now.

163
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,523
Uh-oh.
Did somebody
break your heart?

164
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,027
And then,
I told her everything.
It just came pouring out.

165
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,559
And by the end
of it, she said...

166
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,704
This Barney needs
to be taught a lesson.

167
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,901
You say the word
and I will destroy him.

168
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,573
What do you mean?

Just say the word.

171
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,937
Come on.
That stuff doesn't
really work, does it?

172
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,846
I didn't know
what you wanted, so
I got you a cappuccino,

173
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,978
an espresso,
a latte, a decaf...

174
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,553
Oh, hi, Robin.

175
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,522
And this is
a Turkish coffee.

176

Thank you, Mike.

177

ROBIN: I didn't think
I was gonna think about it,

179
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,258
but then,
I thought about it.

180

Oh, this pilates instructor
was off the charts.

181
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,698
Picture Robin,
but younger.

182
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,126
And bigger boobs.

183
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,208
Maybe not bigger,
but more shapely,
and bigger.

184

00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,606

against the StairMaster,

186
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,054

Do it.

Anyway, we do it.

I was still really
upset about the breakup.

193
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,267

mourning period.

194
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,869
There was a lot of Scotch and
a lot of long nights at the
shooting range.

195
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,912
Hmm. I hope those
weren't the same nights.

Geez, Lily, it's not
like I remember all
of them.

Robin was going through
a mourning period?

198
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,616
I mean, she seemed
fine after the breakup.

199
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,678
Oh, you know how she is.
She tries to keep her
emotions to herself.

200
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,848
But, yeah,
I caught her
crying a couple times.

201
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,886
She cried?
Like real tears?

202
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:17,827

realized what a jackass
he'd been to Robin.

and he couldn't be happier.

00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,123
Robin, I know you're upset.

337
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,449
What? No.

338
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:29,624
I have never been happier.
And this Anita sounds lovely.

339
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,786
I am so glad that
you two just randomly
happened to find each other.

340
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,626
It just warms
my freaking heart!

00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,808
So, are you sure
you're not upset?

346
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,309
Well, of course
I'm upset, Barney!

347
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,282
Don't you see how constantly
talking about your conquests

348
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,482
makes me
feel like I'm just
another number to you?

349
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,254
But you're not just
another number to me.

350
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,723
You know,
and now you're taking Anita,

351
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,251
who you barely know,
on this amazing date,

352
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,488
when I never got
treated that way.

353
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,391
It just...

354
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,226
It just sucks, that's all.

bad at being a boyfriend,

but I had no idea
I'd be so much worse
at being an ex-boyfriend.

358
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,413
I'm sorry.

359
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:30,779
What can I do to
make it up to you?

360
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,091
Nothing, Barney.

361
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,761
You've already proven that
I'm not important to you.

362
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,058
Oh, stop that. I'm serious.
Ask me for anything.

363

Uh, okay,
don't sleep with Anita.

364
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,725
Done.
Barney,

365
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,534
of course you're
gonna sleep with her.

366
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,636
Why else would
you be taking her
on this superdate?

367
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,269
She's not going on
the superdate, Robin.

368
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,542
You are.

Oh, hey, Anita.
I totally meant to call you.

Well, I'm breaking all
my rules coming down here,

376
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,597
but nobody
stands me up like that,
so, are we going out or what?

I'm sorry, I made
a promise to a friend.

378
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,273
I have to say no.

get lucky after the 12th date.

No.
