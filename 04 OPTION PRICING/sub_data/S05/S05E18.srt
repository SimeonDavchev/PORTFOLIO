OLDER TED: Kids, your
Aunt Lily has always been

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,312
one of those people who
loves their birthday.
Loves it.

00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,510
(BEEPING)

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,341
It's my birthday!

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,375
So it's a good thing
she married Marshall.

6
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:18,285
(BEEPING)

7
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:22,219
It's still my birthday!

8
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,356
Because he loves
planning birthdays.

9
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:27,702
Feliz Cumpleanos, baby.

00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:32,828
The theme of today's birthday
breakfast in bed is

12

13
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,144
It's, uh...

14
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:43,113
How on Earth did we end up in
the lyrical rolling hills of
Northern Spain?

15
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,684
Yay!

16
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,422
Baby, tonight is
gonna be so much fun.

17
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,518
Just the five of us,
black-tie dinner,

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,120
and Ted is
picking up your favorite

19
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,292
cognac pumpkin
cheesecake from Edgar's.

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,460
Yay!

21
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,288
Okay. I am off to run
your super secret
birthday errand.

22
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,385
Yay!

23
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:01,828
And I'm taking
this guy with me,

24
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,432
because I don't like the way
he's looking at you.

25
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:04,534
Yay.

26
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,699
A new camera.

27
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,107
Oh, thank you, Marshall!
I love it!

28

(CLEARS THROAT)
Well, a little bonus.

29
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,407
I took some naked
pictures of myself

30
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,653
before I wrapped it,
put a bow on it.

31
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,308
There wasn't a bow on it.

32
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:20,477
Wrong "it."

get some great shots of our

OLDER TED:
Now, kids, you've seen your
Aunt Lily's photo albums:

37
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:32,857
leather bound,
acid-free paper,

38
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,263
adorable
handwritten captions.

39
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,796
And most importantly,
the group shot.

40
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,671
Cute photo, right, kids?

41
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,800
But what you don't see
is what happened 10 seconds
before this picture was taken.

42
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,867
Okay, I wanna get
the perfect group shot.

43
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,706
Marshall, sit
between Robin
and Barney.

44
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,281
Why?

45
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,910
Oh, you know, light,
color balance, aperture.

46
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,716
You're just saying
camera words. Wait.

47
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,649
You don't want Barney and me
to look like a couple in
this picture, do you?

48
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:01,756
Of course I don't!
You two aren't gonna last.
I'm going for timeless here.

49
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,519
How dare you!

50
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:04,827
That is so rude!

51
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,888
It's true.
Totally true.

52
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,897
We're running on fumes here.
But still rude.

We hated Lily's group shots.

Okay, maybe
I get a little bossy,

56
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,907
but I just wanna
remember those times.

57
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,909
Like tonight.
I can't imagine
a better birthday

58

than being here, with
just my four best friends.

(SHAKILY) And Amanda. Yay.

64
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:56,512
Ted, you were supposed
to bring a cheesecake,

65
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,914
but instead you
brought two grocery bags

66
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,675
and a woman we've
never seen before.

67
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,453
Hi, I'm Marshall.
Welcome to our home.

68

Start talking.

69
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,616
Well, Amanda's gonna make
Lily a cake. She's a chef.

70
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,964
We met when I was
at a restaurant last week,
and I sent some soup back.

71
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,730
Luckily she's got such
pretty hair,

72
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,259
I didn't mind
eating a little bit of it.

73

The Shedder at work.

glad you're making my
birthday cake.

In honor of
Lily's 32nd birthday,

76
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,940
I've got a lot
of great games planned,
starting with Lilial Pursuit.

77
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,284
Ah, clever.

78
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:29,739
Okay, who's got number one?

79
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,707
I do.

80
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,815
Of course you do.
Okay, Amanda goes first.

81
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,548
Thirty-two
seconds on the clock

82
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:39,024
to answer as many
questions as possible.

83

And, go!

84
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:44,292
Question one, what is
Lily's favorite color?
(TICKING)

85
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,985
Well, she's wearing pink,

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,660
so I'm gonna say pink.

87
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:49,696
Yeah, that's Robin.

88
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,030
Oh. Uh...

89
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,835
Her favorite color is elbow.
(MOUTHING) Yellow.

90
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,305
I believe Ted was
mouthing the word "yellow."

91
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,480
Which also
would've been wrong.

called Gilding The Lily.

Thank you.

Okay, you've all written down
your favorite things about
the birthday girl,

95
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,685
and, Lily-pad,
you guess who
wrote what.

96
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,696
"Lily makes everyone
in her life, from her
friends to her students..."

97
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:22,899
(WHISPERING) Lily's
a kindergarten teacher.

98
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,770
That's what he
means by students.

"...feel loved.

oatmeal raisin cookies ever,

"can recite every line
from Goonies..."

101
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:32,768
Lily saw Goonies
in the theater right after
her parents separated.

102
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,006
For a long time after that,
she had real trouble
trusting people.

person I've ever met.

No, that was me.

get back to that cake.

if you need anything.

You don't want Amanda
in the photo, do you?

127

No, no. It's just, you know,
auto focus, shutter speed,
zoom.

ruin my precious memories!

thinking of Santa,

my mother has Easter
tea with her friend Bunny.

It's Sara.

154
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:01,591
Close. It's Lailanie.
She just had to come
to Christmas

155
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,932
because you said,
"Guys, she might
be the one."

156
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,498
And she's not the only
"might be the one."

Don't look, don't look!
Why aren't you looking?

172
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,097
It's Slash
from Guns N' Roses.

173
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,896
ALL: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

174
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:54,638
Okay, okay. Group shot.
Group shot! Come on!

175
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:58,675
And we got it!
We got a picture
with Slash on my birthday.

176
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,812
Awesome, right? Right?

177
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,748
We were there.
We know how this ends.

178
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,182
Wrong!

179
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,986
ROBIN: You know what's
funny about this picture?

180
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,720
He was grabbing my ass.

181
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,686
LILY: Really?
He was grabbing my ass, too.

182
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,834
He was grabbing my ass, too.
How many hands does that
guy have?

183
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,530
No wonder he's
such a good guitarist.

184
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:18,632
Actually, sorry, dude.
I thought that you were Lily.

185
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,726
Wait a second,
look at these
pictures again.

186
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:24,138
Barney has the
same pose in each shot, and
these are, like, years apart.

187
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:33,847
Ah, yes, about that.
I never take a bad picture.

188
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,851
Never have. Never will.

189
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,093
(SCOFFS) Dude,
there has to be
a bad picture of you.

190
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,588
Nope! Not one.

191
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,850
What about from
elementary school?

192
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,318
Everyone has bad
pictures from school.

193
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,255
Not the Barnacle.

194
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:50,227
I always
look drop-dead,
stone-cold amazing.

195
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:54,003
Unlike Marshall, who just
looks dead, stoned, and cold.

OLDER TED:
He was right, kids.

197
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,636
Your Uncle Marshall
does a lot of things well,

198
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,541
but he does not
take a good picture.

199
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,950
They're not all bad, okay?
Like, here.

200
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,319
Here, look at this one,
my eyes are open.

201
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,618
Marshall, no!
You did put a bow on it!

202
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,191
Chip and dip, Barney?
Sure.

203
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,891
A-ha!
(CLICKS)

204
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,622
Got it!
A bad picture.

205
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,191
Is it, though?

206
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,273
No, wait.
You were eating a chip!

207
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,168
Where's the chip?

208
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,900
It is physically impossible
for me to take a bad picture.

209
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,037
I don't know why.
Ask God.

210
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,808
Look, Lily,
I'm sorry about Amanda,
but I'm just gonna say it.

211
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:37,854
You are being
a birthday brat.

(GASPS)

213
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,884
You're all bent out of shape
just 'cause you think
I ruined a couple of pictures?

214
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:47,316
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, Ted, these girls
have ruined so many events.

215
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,964
Or are you
forgetting Paris?

216
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,190
What happened in Paris?

217
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,055
It was junior year,
and I was studying
abroad in Paris,

218
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,625
and hadn't seen
Marshall for two months.

219
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,304
Two months!

220
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,401
And I had just
started having sex.

221
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,643
I wasn't ready to
stop for two months.

222
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,211
And Marshall was coming
to visit over spring break.

223
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:10,139
And at the last minute,
Ted decided to come
with the girl

224
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,877
he had just gotten back
together with, Karen.

225
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,724
Karen.

226
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,849
I am so excited
you're here.

227
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,685
I'm so excited
to go to Paris.

228
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,060
I'm so excited
to have sex again.

229
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,290
LILY: But just before
the plane took off...

230
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,195
Wait, I wanna
tell you something.

231
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,968
Really?
'Cause I think I wanna
tell you the same thing.

232
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,229
Is your thing, "I had
sex with my philosophy
professor last night"?

233
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,773
'Cause that's my thing.

234

longest seven-and-a-half
hours of Marshall's life.

When I picked them
up at the airport...

238
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,726
Ted broke up with me.

239
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,258
I need to sleep in
your room this week.

240
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,862

was terrible.

of the Eiffel Tower,

What? How do you do that?
You weren't even standing up.

256

The camera loves me, Robin.

257
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,789
More than loves me.
The camera lusts after me.

some nice lingerie, pop in

these girls could
be the one.

in the group photo.

she's not gonna
ruin your birthday.

00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,577
* Happy, Happy Lily Day

340
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,416
All done!
I hope you like it.

341
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:28,128
"Happy 42nd birthday, Lori."

342
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,628
OLDER TED: Kids, you know how
I've told you about Lily's
you're-dead-to-me look?

343
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,967
That expression she gets just
before she explodes in
white-hot rage?

344
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,965
Well, this wasn't it.

345
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,107
(CHUCKLES)

346
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,752
But this was Marshall's.

347
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,120
Forty-second?
Does this hot piece
of ass look 42 to you?

348
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:57,523
Or does she look
like her name is Lori?

349
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,627
Oh, Marshall, it's okay.

350
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,088
No, Lily, it's not okay!

351
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,457
Ted, get this stranger
out of my house.

352
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,055
I am so sorry.

353
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,027
Out!

354
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,479
(DOOR CLOSES)

355
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:25,223
* Happy, Happy Lily Day
Happy, Happy Lily Day *

356
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,799
Well,
Amanda refused to come back.
She thinks you guys hate her.

357
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,528
Marshall,
you have to go apologize.

358
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:42,065
You ruined Lily's birthday,
and you want me to apologize.

359
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,442
If anything,
you should apologize to me.

360
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,441
What are you talking about?

361
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:49,043
Ted, you bring girls
to these intimate events,

362
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,136
and it makes them think
that things are
really serious.

363
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,348
And then,
when you break up with them,

364
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,679
you know who
they turn to? Me.

365
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:58,294
I've been
your girlfriend
clean-up crew for years.

366
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,488
February, 2005.
I had just come back
from a marathon study session

367
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,691
at the law library.

368
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,692
Hey, hey, Natalie.
Where's Ted?

369
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,725
We broke up. Again.

370
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,227
Uh-oh.

371
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,495
Won't you sit with me for
a little while? Just sit.

372
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,636
Oh, man. You know what?
I've been up for, like,
36 hours.

373
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:23,282
(SOBBING INCOHERENTLY) Yeah,
but I don't have anyone
else to talk to.

374
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,680
Just for a few minutes.
Thanks.

375
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,853
(SIGHS)

376
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,750
(WEEPING)

377
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,653
And, at first, I was
completely sympathetic.

378
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:37,386
But, damn it,
Ted, over the years,
you've made me cynical.

379
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,564
You know what?
I'm gonna go get
us some Rocky Road,

380
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:43,502
and we're just gonna sit here
and talk it out until it
makes sense.

381
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,200
I just thought
we had something
so special, you know?

382
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:53,335
Me, too.
Yeah, but, you know,
life goes on, sweetheart.

383
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,243
I don't know how I'm gonna
put my life back together
after this.

384
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,436
Oh, shut up.

385
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,747
Well, I'm sorry my
search for true love

386
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,321
has been such an
inconvenience to
you guys.

387
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,751
You know what?
Maybe your precious pictures

388
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:07,886
would look
a lot better if
I wasn't in them.

389
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,420
They'd look a lot better
if Marshall weren't in them.

390
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,156
Cheap shot, cheap shot.

391
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,562
You know what these
pictures are, Lily?

392
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,433
They're a big, fat lie.

393
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,232
They're posed.
They're touched up.

394
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,174
They're what you want our
life to be, not what it is.

395
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,469
That's not true.
Oh, yeah?

396
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,401
Okay. Look at this one.
Halloween, two years ago.

397
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,907
You and Marshall
got in a huge fight

398
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,008
because you didn't
wanna dress up
as penguins.

399
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,209
No, no, no.
It's not just that
she didn't want to.

400
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,412
It's that she called
penguins lame. Penguins.

401
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,605
And yet, here you are,
smiling like nothing's wrong.

402
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,517
Completely phony.

403
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,690
Oh! Robin's birthday,
three years ago.

404
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,289
Robin had a cold,

405
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,722
and you made
her change out of her
pajamas for the picture.

406
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,286
And then you pinched
my cheeks really hard
to get some color in them.

407
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,296
Yeah, but you
looked pretty.

408
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,529
And then we all ate
chocolate cake in my bed.

409
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,625
Actually, that was
a really nice night.

410
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,896
Yeah, it was.

411
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,404
Yeah, I guess it was.

412
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,467
Hey, look at this one.

413
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,207
This is the first picture
the three of us ever
took together.

414
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,813
That's right. It was.

415
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,154
Hey, you remember
how it happened?

416
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,647
Okay, ready?

417
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,581
Wait, wait, wait.
What pose should we do?

418
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,717
Buddy cop picture?

419
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,693
Oh, no, no. What about
an '80s sitcom about
two roommates

420
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,233
who never
agree on anything?
Mmm-hmm.

421
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,456
Nice. Okay, one, two...

422
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,304
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

423
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,931
Hi, Marshall.
Ready for the movie?

424
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,696
Um, yeah.
Just a second, though, okay?
We're about to make history.

425
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,936
We're about to take our
first ever roommate picture.

426
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,571
Yeah. Hey, why don't you
get in the picture, too?

427
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,377
Really?
Yeah.

428
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,479
Wait. What are
you doing, Ted?

429
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,780
What if we break up?

430
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,381
What if you don't?

431
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,284
Come on.
Come on.

432
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:46,915
(CLICKS)

433
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,393
I forgot all about that.

434
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:52,732
Marshall and I had just
been dating a few weeks,

435
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,729
and you invited
me into the picture.

436
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,658
Well, I liked you.

437
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,897
We have to get Amanda back.
Really?

438
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,942
Ted, you believed in me.
It's my turn to believe
in you.

439
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,839
For all I know,
she's the one.

440
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,472
Thanks, Lil.

441
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:10,937
I think Lori's age
has made her very wise.

442
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,807
They say your 40s are
when you really get
to know yourself.

443
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,515
Mmm.

444
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,318
OLDER TED: So, your
Aunt Lily called Amanda.

445
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,990
All right, people,
gather around.

446
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,248
Let's make a memory.
Okay.

447
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,818
Okay, Marshall.
No, Marshall, try this.

448
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,526
Keep your eyes closed
until the last second,

449
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,928
and when I say so,
open them. Okay?
Okay, Ted.

450
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Hey, Barney,
is that a hole
in your suit jacket?

451
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,425
What? Where?

452
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:32,528
Now, Marshall.

453
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,565
(CLICKS)

454
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,571
ROBIN: Damn it!

455
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,313
Ted, name that bitch.

456
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,583
Bertha... Bertha?

457
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,322
No. It was my birthday.

458
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,448
Your brain
makes associations
in a very obvious way.

459
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,994
All right,
people, gather around.

460
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,719
Let's make a memory.

461
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,425
Hey, Robin,
what's in this
dip that you made?

462
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:04,498
It tastes like cilantro, and
you know that cilantro
makes me...

463
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:05,931
(SNEEZING)
(CLICKS)

464
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,725
ROBIN: Yes!
