00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:05,539
OLDER TED:
It was the fall of 2009
and I was a professor now.

2
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,813
So, I decided to change
my look a little bit.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,381
And people were noticing.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,550
Ah, tweed.

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:14,249
Textile of the eunuch.

6
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:16,782
You know, I've always wondered
why those tweed jackets have
elbow patches.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,247
Because the people
who wear them are
constantly going,

8
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,487
"Aw, geez,
why can't I get laid?"

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,756
You are wrong.

10
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,061
The ladies dig
the professor look.

11
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:27,804
You know,
there is something to that.

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:31,668
I remember thinking my tenth
grade math teacher was
very sexy.

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,469
I wonder if Harold's
still in jail.

14
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,638
What? Tax evasion.

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,709
Among other things.

16
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:44,381
So, guys, Marshall and I
wanted to invite you to
our place

17
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,312
for a little
couples' night.

18
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:49,247
Sure. Why not?

19
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,653
OLDER TED:
For years,
Marshall and Lily had been

20
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,394
the only married couple in
a group full of single people.

21
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,661
It got lonely.

22
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,858
(DOORBELL RINGING)

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,530
So, they were always
searching for another
couple to double-date.

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,759
There was only one problem.

25
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,363
Welcome.
Gouda?

26
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,366
They sucked at it.

27
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,298
(LAUGHING) This is great.

28
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:09,274
We're having fun.
You're having fun, right?

29
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:13,243
So, should we just go ahead
and lock the four of us in
for New Year's?

30
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:16,184
Um, it's April.

31
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,110
Right. Sorry.
We're getting
ahead of ourselves.

32
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:20,807
Let's talk Thanksgiving.

33
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,148
(GASPS) Our parents
(IN SING SONG)
really want to meet you!

34
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:30,786
Well, we should
probably be going.

35
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,434
Wait. No, wait, if you leave
now, Colonel Mustard just
gets away with it.

36
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,631
It's getting pretty late.
We're going to go.

37
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:36,563
There's still pie.

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,600
Tonight was fantastic.
We should do it again.

39
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:50,437
I'm sorry, Marshall,
but Falguni and I are just
not that into you. And you.

40
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,808
OLDER TED:
But just when Lily and Marshall
were about to give up,

41
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,416
two of their best friends
in the world got together.

42
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,349
(DOOR OPENING)
And hope returned
to their hearts.

43
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,445
(WHOOPING)

44
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,257
So, when Lily said...

45
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,459
Marshall and I wanted
to invite you to our place

46
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,261
for a little couples' night.

47
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:08,403
Sure, why not?

48
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,629
OLDER TED: Barney and Robin
had no idea what they were
about to walk into.

49
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,274
Okay. Game time.

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,840
Let's review
the flow of the room.

51
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,908
Barney and
Robin enter here.
Stop here for margaritas.

52
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,768
That's a great
conversation starter.

53
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,777
We can tell them
about our trip to Cabo.

54
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,939
Great, 'cause I got
that story about
Sammy Hagar

55
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,877
and the
Belgian waffle
locked and loaded.

56
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,283
Then we'll move on
to the hot apps station.

57
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,646
And, depending on
how things are going,

58
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,794
some lively
pre-dinner charades.

59
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,790
Right, but we'll
play that one by...

60
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,255
Sounds like?

61
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,233
Okay, you can
be Robin's partner.

62
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:42,502
(DOORBELL RINGING)

63
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,227
Baby, we can do this.

64
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:52,265
Welcome.
Gouda?

65
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:55,306
OLDER TED: Meanwhile,
my half-baked theory that
ladies dig the professor look

66
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,913
was actually
proving to be true.

67
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,414
So, is it hard
to grade papers?

68
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,346
No, you just
got to make it fun.

69
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:04,521
For example, every time I spot
a grammatical error,
I do a shot.

70
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,692
I'm trashed right now,
and I blame our
public school system.

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,620
(GIGGLES)

72
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,456
Sometimes things just seem
to magically fall into place.

73
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,232
So, you said you
live right upstairs?

74
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:15,502
Whether it's in
the dating world...

75
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,299
Take care. Bye.
Bye!

76
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,871
...or the double-dating world.

77
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
Nailed it!
Best night ever!

78
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,914
Worst night ever.

79
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,811
(SIGHS)

80
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,862
Hey, how was
the big couples' night
with Marshall and Lily?

81
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,625
Brutal.
Really? How?

82
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:54,744
It was like we were on a date
with a sad, chubby girl our
mom made us call.

83
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,268
Yeah, and they
were so nervous,

84
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:58,314
that they
weren't even making
sense half the time.

85
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,809
Hey.
Come on in.

86
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Would you like a margarita?

87
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,409
In Cabo,
I saw Sammy Hagar
eating a Belgian waffle!

88
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:09,716
And they kept shoving
platters of food in
our faces.

89
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,450
Let me guess. Did Marshall
get, like, super intense
about the cheese?

90
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,846
(GASPS) Yeah,
how'd you know?

91
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,617
Poor Marshall.

92
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,756
Lily's this gourmet cook,
and all she lets Marshall do

93
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,591
is pick out one
sad block of cheese.

94
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,758
That's
prosciutto-wrapped melon.

95
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,866
You guys
are going to want to
get in on this gouda.

96
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,468
That's seared scallops
with a mango chutney.

97
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,741
Seriously, don't sleep
on the gouda.

98
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,870
And that's
lobster ravioli in
a black truffle oil.

99
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,476
Tick tock goes
the gouda clock.

100
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,980
We didn't realize
there was gonna
be dinner.

101
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,082
We sucked down
a couple of tacos
outside the subway.

102
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,824
P.S., not sitting great.

103
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,986
And if anything didn't go
according to plan, they
would freak out.

104
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,333
What do you mean,
the egg timer
is broken?

105
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,990
What are we going to
use for charades, sweetie?

106
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,357
I'm working on it, darling.

107
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,766
Okay? Just stall them.

108
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,898
Now, Robin.
You work in television.

109
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,714
We're experiencing some
technical difficulties.
You get that?

110
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,378
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
So, we're still laughing.

111
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,078
Right? Laugh, Marshall.

112
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:11,178
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

113
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,617
Come on,
they just got excited.

114
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,049
They've been looking for
couple best friends forever.

115
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,645
Plus, I'm sure
they weren't that bad.

116
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,364
Show him.

117
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:27,701
This is a web site Marshall
already made about last night.

118
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,498
It's called
itwasthebestnightever.com.

119
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,136
MARSHALL:
* It was the
best night ever

120
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,670
* Laughter raining down
like April showers

121
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,676
* Oh, we talked for hours...

122
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,875
Oh, that's no good.

123
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,747
* Best night ever
Then we played charades

124
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,487
* Lily made some crÃ©me brÃ»lÃ©e

125
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,525
* And now that
we're best couple friends

126
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:05,431
* There's only one thing
left to say...

127
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,770
* Are you free?
Are you free?

128
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,472
* Are you free?
Are you free?

129
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,814
* Are you free next Saturday?

130
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,440
That's the 17th.

131
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,775
* Are you free?

132
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:16,539
Friday or Sunday
would also work.

133
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,577
Or basically any other day.

134
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,823
Needless to say,
we've both changed
our e-mail addresses.

135
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,920
I don't understand.
If last night went
so horribly,

136
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,963
why do Lily and Marshall
think it was such a hit?

137
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,718
I mean,
we knew we were
gonna have fun tonight,

138
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,427
but we had
no idea how much.

139
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,930
Yeah, tough luck, every
Saturday night I've
ever had,

140
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,732
'cause this one just
blew you out of the water.

141
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:37,974
Let's do it again, soon.

142
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:38,868
Yeah, we'll call you.

143
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,997
They're your friends!

144
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,695
Why would
you just blatantly
lie to them like that?

145
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,607
Well, that's what you say
at the end of a crappy date.

146
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,039
Hey, Ted.
Great time last night.

147
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,135
Let's do it again, soon.
I'll call you.

148
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,745
(DOOR CLOSES)
Right?

149
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:55,982
Who was that?

150
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,146
I don't want to brag,

151
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,945
but it seems
chicks are really digging
the whole professor thing.

152
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:05,558
Last night, she picked me
up at the bar. And then...

153
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:09,163
Well, she actually wound up
falling asleep on the couch.
But, hey, that happens.

154
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,174
Uh, no, it doesn't.

155
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,939
Sure, it does.
You know, she was...

156
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,008
She was
just exhausted
from being turned on.

157
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,608
But you heard her.
She wants to do
it again, soon.

158
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:24,009
Ted, let me
ask you a question.

159
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,014
Where does this
girl live, exactly?

160
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,176
Westchester. Why?

161
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,454
(LAUGHS)

162
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,191
You're the
Sexless Innkeeper.

163
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,849
Oh, my God!
You're right!

164
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,717
He's totally
the Sexless Innkeeper!

165
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,126
What the hell is
the Sexless Innkeeper?

166
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:42,028
Ted, many a man...
Nay, many a soul

167
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,132
has their own tale
of the Sexless Innkeeper.

168
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,104
Why, I had a run-in
with one just last year.

169
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,504
I even composed
a poem about it.

170
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,837
Would you care to hear it?
Not really.

171
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,212
'Twas the night
before New Year's,
and the weather grew mean.

172
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:58,182
It was 3:00 in the morning,
and I was stranded in Queens.

173
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:04,888
The tavern grew empty.
The gaslights grew dim.

174
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,118
The horse-drawn carriages
were all but snowed in...

175
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,255
Wait. If this was last year,
why are you acting like it
was Oliver Twist?

176
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,031
Ted, it's a poem.

177
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,729
Last call was approaching,
and my fortunes looked bleak.

178
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:23,997
Then I turned to my left
and stifled a shriek.

179
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:29,207
She had a peach fuzz beard
and weighed 16 stone.

180
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,012
She gobbled up hot wings
and swallowed the bones.

181
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,905
(CRUNCHING)

182
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:37,247
I muffled a scream
and threw up in my mouth.

183
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,594
I asked, "Where do you live?"
And she said,

184
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:43,691
"One block south."

185
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:47,134
I swallowed my pride
and six shots of whiskey.

186
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:56,074
And prayed to the Gods
that she wasn't too frisky.

187
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,773
Back in her cave,
she prepared us
a snack.

188
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,106
(FLOOR CREAKING)

189
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,150
'Neath her mighty hooves,
the floorboards did crack.

190
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:09,948
But when she returned,
she found a sound sleeper.

191
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,753
And thus she became
the Sexless Innkeeper.

192
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,863
And so are you.

193
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,361
Wait, you're saying that girl
just used me for a place
to crash?

194
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,863
Ted, you mentioned that
you live right upstairs.

195
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,766
She saw
the tweed jacket,
which basically says

196
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,339
you're not interested in,
nor probably even capable
of having sex.

197
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,309
And she thought,
"Hey, free lodging."

198
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,109
No way. I'm not
the Sexless Innkeeper.

199
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:40,113
Ted, that girl had
no intention of ever
hooking up with you.

200
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:44,147
Which is funny, because
usually it's the innkeeper
who offers turndown service.

201
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,194
(EXCLAIMS)
Ha!

202
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,790
Hey, guys. Good news.

203
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,833
First of all, you can ignore
all the e-mails and texts
we've sent you.

204
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,789
We have. Go on.

205
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,627
Because we went
ahead and booked

206
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,203
that couples' weekend
for all of us in Vermont!

207
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,331
Wait, you guys were
serious about that?

208
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:04,937
We never joke about B&B's,
especially at the height
of syrup season.

209
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,072
Saturday, we've got
apple-picking,

210
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,877
antiquing,
then a haunted hay ride.

211
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:14,111
And then, on Sunday,
we're up at 6:00 a.m.
for the fall foliage hike.

212
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,847
Now, you better
pack your long johns,
'cause it is cold up there.

213
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:21,924
Look! I'm sorry that
we have been dodging
your calls,

214
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,685
but we respect you
guys too much as friends to
give you some song and dance.

215
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,725
You deserve the truth.

216
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,697
(EXHALES)

217
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:36,735
The US Navy has found
intelligent alien life
at the bottom of the ocean.

218
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,740
For reasons
I can't explain,

219
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:42,342
Robin and I
have been tapped to
lead the expedition.

220
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,745
Wow, Barney.
That kind of sounds like
the stuff you say to girls

221
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,779
when you're too much
of a coward to dump them.

222
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,875
Yeah. You know, that's
exactly what it sounds like.

223
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,348
But if that's true,
that's awesome.

224
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,087
What's going on?

225
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,263
Look, all this coupley stuff,
it's just not us.

226
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,932
Barney and I are barely
equipped to date each other,

227
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,701
let alone you guys.

228
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,200
Plus, the alien thing.

229
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,932
(SCOFFS) Come on, Marshall.
Let's go.

230
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,197
Yeah. Let's go.

231
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,395
You know what, Lily...
No, you know what...

232
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,236
No. You know what?

233
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:15,241
I hope those underwater
aliens are cold-blooded.

234
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,775
'Cause then you guys
will get along just fine.

235
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,878
(SIGHS)

236
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,316
I think they bought it.

237
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,724
(CRYING)
I can't believe
they broke up with us.

238
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,286
We're so lovable.

239
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,394
No, we're not.
We're ugly and gross.

240
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,228
I thought we did
everything right.

241
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,233
I know!

242
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,025
I know.
We had the gouda.
We had my waffle story.

243
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,768
I even sent them
an awesome photo montage...

244
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,311
Nothing.

245
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,939
Oh, dear God.

246
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,976
Marshall, we've been
over and over this.

247
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,512
You have to stop
sending those to people.

248
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,277
OLDER TED:
It was true.

249
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,246
Marshall had
become addicted
to creating songs

250
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:02,185
and photo
montages documenting
various mundane events.

251
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,392
So, for months,
all of Marshall's friends
and professional colleagues

252
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,534
were getting
e-mails like this.

253
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,029
MARSHALL:
* Ordered Chinese food today

254
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,933
* Some moo shu
pork sauce got away

255
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,837
* Flipped the cushion
Now everything's okay *

256
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,851
* Cat-sitting for Lily's mom

257
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:28,348
* Cat-sitting for Lily's mom

258
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:29,581
* It's gonna be fun

259
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,946
* It's gonna bring
us all closer together *

260
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,026
* Cat funeral

261
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,399
* Cat funeral

262
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,969
* It was an accident

263
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,869
* And not entirely my fault

264
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,042
* Meow, meow, meow, meow

265
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,271
* Cat funeral

266
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,936
* Meow, meow, meow, meow

267
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,275
* Cat funeral

268
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,347
We'll miss you, Whiskers.

269
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,979
* Meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow... *

270
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,955
I can't believe you
sent them one of those.

271
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,858
They think
we're insane now.

272
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,890
If I recall,
they didn't dump us

273
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,525
until you brought
up that Vermont trip.

274
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,460
It was way too early.

275
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,995
First, a boat
ride around the city,
then a trip to Vermont.

276
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,471
It's a rookie mistake,
and you're better than that.

277
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,300
What about you forgetting
to check the egg timer
for charades?

278
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,437
I gave you one thing to
do, Marshall. One thing.

279
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,584
One thing?
One thing?

280
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,881
Wow. Really?

281
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:37,354
So, I guess that gouda

282
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,454
just walked itself
right through the door,

283
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,193
sliced itself up,

284
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:50,903
and arranged itself
in a perfect semi-circle
around not three, not four,

285
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:55,201
but five different kinds of
sturdy, cheese-bearing
crackers?

286
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,570
You're a sturdy,
cheese-bearing cracker!

287
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,535
Guys, Lily and Marshall
haven't been to the bar
all week.

288
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,307
They're taking
this really hard.

289
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,516
Ted, I could listen to
this guilt trip all day,

290
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,948
but don't you have to
get back up to the inn?

291
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,154
I mean,
who's working
the front desk?

292
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,256
Seriously,
they're your friends.
You got to go apologize.

293
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,659
To your point,
Ted, as an innkeeper,

294
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,662
do you do that cheapy thing
where you only change the
linens upon request?

295
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,896
(STAMMERING)
I mean, how much water
is that actually saving?

296
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,265
Robin, you know I'm right.

297
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,172
Ignoring a problem
doesn't make it
go away.

298
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,944
Usually, it just makes
it bigger.

299
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,413
You're right.
Thank you.

300
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,641
All that
sexlessness
has made you wise.

301
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,546
(BARNEY CHUCKLES)
For God's sake!

302
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,248
Mint on the pillow, Ted!

303
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,110
And don't charge for Wi-Fi.
It seems greedy!

304
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:41,878
Yes.

305
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,216
(LAUGHS)

306
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,423
OLDER TED:
But, eventually, even Barney
and Robin had to admit

307
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,155
they owed Lily and
Marshall an apology.

308
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,094
Hey. We wanted
to say we're sorry.

309
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,027
Oh, I wish
you had called.

310
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,674
I swear, he was right there,
just eating a Belgian waffle!

(ALL LAUGHING)

312
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,372
Well, he can't
have enjoyed it as much
as I'm enjoying this gouda!

313
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,574
Oh!

314
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,636
Well, listen,
now's not a good time.

315
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,206
But we'll call you.

Oh, we can't.
We're here with Py and Shea.

Yeah, so...
It's just...

We haven't seen
you guys all week.

324
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,668
Hey, maybe all six
of us could hang out.
Yeah.

325
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,000
It might be weird.
We're kind of on
a double date.

00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,237
Yeah.
Wouldn't want
you to feel like

a fifth and sixth wheel.

are these people?

here from Hawaii.

gonna grab a quick beer
and then take these kooks

338
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,630
for a boat ride
around the city.

339
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,562
Wow, it sounds like
this is getting
pretty serious.

340
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,367
Well, we don't
want to jinx it,

341
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,699
but we kind of think
they might be the two.

342
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,381
(SCOFFS)
Who needs them?

343
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,249
(SCOFFS) Not us.

344
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,708
(COUPLES LAUGHING)

345
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,324
(ALL BY MYSELF
PLAYING)

346
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,594
* Living alone

347
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,590
* We think of
all the friends we've known

348
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:40,226
* But when we
dial the telephone

349
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,797
(CYCLE BELL RINGING)

350
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,704
* Nobody's home

351
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,409
Hi. Two for dinner.

352
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,011
Just the two of you?

353
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:57,545
* All by ourselves

354
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,751
* Don't want to be

355
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:06,787
* All by ourselves anymore

356
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,325
* All by ourselves...

357
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,735
Hey, why don't we
call that weird couple
down the hall from you?

358
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,538
You know, with the ferrets?

359
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,840
Maybe they want to
come over and play Taboo.

360
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,182
After midnight? No way.
We can't Tabooty-call them,

361
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:22,779
it's pathetic.

362
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,177
Hey, guys.

363
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,383
(BOTH MUTTERING)

364
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,375
Barney, are you wearing
sweatpants?

365
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,387
Maybe. But they're Armani.

366
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,357
Okay, guys,
I've got some
bad news for you.

367
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,330
So, I'm just going to
come out and say it.
You're a couple.

368
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,461
And no matter how
hard you try to fight it,
couples need other couples.

369
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,627
That's why you
miss Marshall and Lily.

370
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,796
And can't you
just admit that?

371
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,670
(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah!

372
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,643
That was amazing, Lily!
Yeah.

373
00:17:55,675 --> 00:18:00,175
I know! When I got
that left-hand-yellow,
I was like, "What?"

374
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,583
You guys are the best.
Right back at you!

375
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,675

(DINGS)

379
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,450
BOTH: Ding.

380
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,597
For charades.

381
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,168
How do
we know you two
won't hurt us again?

382
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,635
You don't.

383
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:05,913
You know what?
We have two very nice
people up in that apartment

384
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,445
who are perfect for us.

385
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,521
Then what are you doing,
standing out in the rain
with us?

386
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,790
Damn it.

387
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,662
Why is there
something so attractive
about a bad boy and girl?

388
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,357
I think we can change them.

389
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:24,934
Come here, you two.

390
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,873
We'll never sleep
on the gouda again.

* All by ourselves...

392
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,851
Hey, Barney. I got
a little poem for you.

393
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:43,882
You want to hear it?

394
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,416
Not really.

395
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,252
'Twas the night
before this one,

396
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,987
I had hours to kill.

397
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,762
I sat in the tavern,
grading parchments
with quill.

398
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,892
With quill?

399
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,796
Barney. It's a poem.

400
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,797
A busty, young
lassie flashed me a grin.

401
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:05,813
Her garb said classy,
but her eyes whispered sin.

402
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:09,378
She said,
"You're a teacher?"
I said, "Yes, indeed."

403
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,939
"I must have you,"
she moaned.

404
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,407
"I'm turned on by tweed."

405
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:18,247
With haste
we did scamper
to my chamber anon.

406
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:23,385
We fell to the couch,
and, bro, it was on.

407
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,633
I unlaced her bodice.
Our passions grew deeper.

408
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:31,299
And thus ends the tale
of the Sexless Innkeeper.

409
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,000
No way. You made that up.

410
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,967
Are you coming back
to bed, Professor?

411
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,513

(EXHALES)

413
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,007
God, I love being single.

414
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,981
Barney, you
ready for brunch
with Lily and Marshall?

415
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,989
What have I done?
