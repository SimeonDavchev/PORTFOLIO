Robots vs. Wrestlers?
Never!

But we assume it's some sort
of sporting event that pits
robots against wrestlers.

I know, she moved in
with her boyfriend,

14

and said she doesn't wanna
hang out with us anymore.

It's impossible

with Don on Saturday.

Otherwise, I have some

I'm sorry, Lily,
but I gotta give this

She said no?
How could she say no?

32
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,456
Robots vs. Wrestlers
is our most important
tradition as a group!

33
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,933
Tradition? We've never
done this before.

34
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,402
It's Robots
vs. Wrestlers, Lily.

35

How is that not
gonna be a tradition?

36

how it starts.

then Marshall and
Lily have a baby,

then Ted...

alone in his apartment,
devoured by his cats,

not pretty.

and I don't like it!

43

Oh, Barney, you don't have
to worry about Marshall
and me having kids.

44
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,850
That's a long way
down the road.

45
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,459
Exactly.
It's down the road,
a medium way.

46
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:03,963
A medium long way.

47

And the decidedly
French influence on
the inside. I know!
