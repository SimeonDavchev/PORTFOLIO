00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:04,566
OLDER TED: Kids, your
Aunt Robin had only been
dating Don a short while,

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,065
when one evening,
out of nowhere...

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:07,237
Robin?
Hmm.

4
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,605
Do you wanna move in?

5
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:14,481
(STUTTERING) Well,
it's kind of soon, but,

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:18,845
sure, I would
consider moving in here.
Just let me think about it.

7
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:21,256
No, I meant do you wanna
move in on the couch so
I could sit down?

8
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,056
Yeah. That's
what I meant, too.

9
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:27,163
Like I said, just
let me think about it.

10
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:28,625
Okay.
Okay.

11
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,369
Yeah. I'm okay with that.
Okay.

12
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:38,544
But now that
you mentioned it,

13
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,637
do you wanna move in?

14
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,806
So, what did you say?

15
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,054
I'm considering it.

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,449
You're considering it?

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,450
Yeah.
You barely know him.

18
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,522
Plus, the guy's a loser
with a dead-end job.

19
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,621
We have the
same job, Barney.

20
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,363
And we couldn't be
prouder of you, angel.

21
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,688
Ugh.

22
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,533
Well, sweetie,
this does seem
kind of fast.

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,989
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe you're right.

24
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,027
I think you
should move in with him.

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,331
You do?
Yeah.

26
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,403
Yeah. I mean,
I see how happy you are.

27
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,332
And as much as I
love you as a roommate,

28
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,437
I want you to do
what's right for you.

29
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:09,739
Oh!

30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,910
Are you
trying to kick me out
because of the milk thing?

31
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,269
It's really annoying.

32
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:18,405
(SHOUTING) Robin!

33
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,629
No. I have a system.

34
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:37,331
I put the empty
carton back in the fridge
to remind us to buy milk.

35
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,925
Okay, why don't you leave
a full carton to remind us
we don't have to buy milk?

36
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:43,198
All right, all right.

37
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:47,577
As your ex, before
you jump into anything,
I need to meet this guy.

38
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,678
I think it's kind of weird
that I haven't met him yet.

39
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,580
Totally weird.
It's almost like someone

40
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,652
carefully orchestrated
it that way on purpose.

41
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,946
Fine. But
you have to promise to
be on your best behavior.

42
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,716
I promise.

43
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,294
So, I'm banging
this Portuguese
contortionist

44
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:06,164
and I swear,
she is so flexible,

45
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:08,964
at one point
she was on top of
me and underneath me.

46
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,226
Up top and down low!

47
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,374
One and two, bang!

48
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,697
Who needs?
Who needs?
Who needs?

49
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:15,765
I'm good. I'm good.

50
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,213
And that would be Barney.

51
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,738
He means well.

52
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,112
Well, actually,
I'm not sure that's true.

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,140
I think he's awesome.

54
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,546
But I feel bad for any woman
with the kind of low
self-esteem

55
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:27,448
who would actually
date a guy like that.

56
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,721
OLDER TED: And that's
when I realized Robin never
told Don she had dated Barney.

57
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,762
I like you, Don.
We both love a good Scotch.

58
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,888
We both enjoy my
compelling stories.
Yeah.

59
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,194
And we both dated Robin.

60
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:40,357
OLDER TED:
Now he knew.

61
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,445
So, Barney's your ex and
you still hang out with him?

62
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,851
I got to say I'm a little
uncomfortable with that.

63
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:05,222
Oh, look, don't be.
It's like we never dated.

64
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,863
Long story short, this
exchange student's
arms gave out,

65
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,388
and we both fell,
ass over sex swing.

66
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,464
Seriously,
I have not been
able to find a girl

67
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:13,793
who can do that
position since Robin.

68
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,403
Hey, Lily! Marshall!

69
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,001
How was
your weekend away,
or any other topic?

70
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,543
Awful.
Terrible.

71
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,310
Twin beds?
We can't sleep
in separate beds.

72
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,540
We should go complain.

73
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,546
Yeah, you're right. I'm gonna
march down there and demand
another room.

74
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:35,219
Yeah, I'll go with you
in just a sec.

75
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,788
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

76
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,589
MAID: Housekeeping.

77
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,629
Could you come back later?
We're taking a little catnap.

78
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,288
MAID: It's time to check out.

79
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,763
We slept for 18 hours.

80
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,328
We missed four
pre-paid meals.

81
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,066
I lost 11 pounds.

82
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,072
Hey, Ted, do you think
it's weird that Robin is
still friends with Barney?

83
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,105
I think it's weird
that we're all still
friends with Barney.

84
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,080
I just don't know
how I feel about
her hanging out

85
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,109
with one of her
exes all the time.

86
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,514
OLDER TED:
And that's when I realized
Robin had failed to tell Don

87
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:10,077
about another one of
her exes, me.

88
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:14,387
No, hanging out
with one ex is fine.
Even two, I'd give a pass.

89
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,292
Hell, two might be
even better than one,

90
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,185
for some reason.

91
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,526
Yeah, but if you
were dating someone

92
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,101
and he hung out with one
of his exes all the time...

93
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,859
Oh, wait, I'm sorry. "He"?

94
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,627
Yeah, and he was friends
with one of his exes...

95
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,096
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, dude, dude,
hold on.

96
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,735
Do you think I'm gay?

97
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,170
Well, yeah.

98
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,005
Why would you assume that?

99
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,412
Hey.

100
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,254
Hey, Ted, your
calligraphy teacher called.

101
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,408
And? And?

102
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,747
Your ink is in.

103
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,481
Yes!

104
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,921
Hey, guys,
I just wanna make sure
Project Runway is recording.

105
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,831
Did the Jets
get new costumes?

106
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:55,099
Well, I guess
we won't be having
creme brulee tonight.

107
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,058
My browning torch is broken.

108
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,867
You know,
when I heard your
roommate was a single guy,

109
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,112
I was a little jealous.
But now that I know
he's gay, I'm okay.

110
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,938
Oh, Ted's not...

111
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,084
But we still got
homemade lady fingers
and piping hot Darjeeling.

112
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,350
Awesome. Thank you.

113
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,350
Ted's not what?

114
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:17,852
Ted's not
gonna be around a lot.
He's following Cher on tour.

115
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,393
Okay, don't get me wrong,
Cher puts on a hell of
a show.

116
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,493
But I am not gay.

117
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,985
Hey, Lily, be honest.

118
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,197
Is it weird that
Robin hangs out with one
of her exes all the time?

119
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,099
Well, Ted and Robin
broke up years ago.
It's a non-issue.

120
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,602
Ted and Robin?

121
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,304
Not seeming so gay now,
am I, Donny?

122
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,866
Appletini for
the gentleman.
Thank you.

123
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,936
You dated Ted, too?

124
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,875
Robin, of the four people
you consider your best
friends in New York,

125
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,511
you've slept
with 50% of them.

126
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,446
Don, they're just my friends.

127
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,881
Yeah, but they're
also your exes.

128
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,346
And you live
with one of them.

129
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,845
Look, I'm sorry, I got to...
I got to think about all this.

130
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,961
LILY: (SIGHING) Mmm.
Mmm.

131
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,604
MARSHALL: My God,
she's a thousand degrees!

132
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,702
It's like putting my
leg against a tailpipe.

133
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,108
LILY: Ow! His toenails
are like daggers.

134
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,608
MARSHALL:
I'd love a sandwich,

135
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,347
but no eating in bed.

136
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,321
Stupid rule.

137
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,720
We have ants one time.

138
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,359
LILY: Great, and now
he's falling asleep.

139
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,931
Cue the river of drool.

140
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,931
(GRUNTS)

141
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,227
MARSHALL:
My knee itches.

142
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,596
Just one little scratch.

143
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,608
Marshall!

144
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,579
I think we should
get separate beds.

145
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,451
Yes! A mini fridge
and separate beds.

146
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:54,751
Deal!

147
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,120
Don.
Hi.

148
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,661
I came to apologize to
all of you. I overreacted.

149
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,859
Well, we owe you
an apology, too, Don.

150
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,961
We said some
pretty hurtful things.

151
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:06,963
No, you didn't.

152
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:10,104
Right, right,
that was after you left.

153
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you the truth
in the first place.

154
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,543
No, I acted
like a total drama queen.
That's not offensive, right?

155
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,639
Still not gay.
Sorry.

156
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,741
So, look, the point
is you both are clearly
very important to Robin.

157
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,014
So, why don't
we all have dinner
tomorrow night at my place?

158
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:23,783
Oh, that's great.

159
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,708
Looking forward to it, buddy.

160
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:27,677
Thanks.
You're welcome.

161
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,246
DON: You want to go?
Yeah.

162
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,053
See you guys.
Bye.

163
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,524
Bye.

164
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,660
Ted?
Yeah?

165
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,063
I must have Robin back.

166
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,931
You're kidding, right?
No.

167
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,166
I don't know what it is,
but I want Robin back.

168
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,772
I know what it is.

169
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,644
You're like a little kid
who throws a toy away

170
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,944
and then wants it back
the second another kid
starts playing with it.

171
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,976
Well, maybe I wasn't
done playing with it.

172
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,521
Maybe I just set it down
'cause I wanted to play with
some other stuff for a second!

173
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,319
Okay.

174
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,550
You're ready.

175
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,185
Ready for what?

176
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,359
To read the letter.

177
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,918
OLDER TED:
Kids, the letter was
a device I'd invented

178
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,598
to remind myself why
I'd broken up with somebody.
I'd been doing it for years.

179
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,869
"Dear Future Ted,
never get back
with Karen

180
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,229
"because she's
a pretentious snob.

181
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,998
"Oh, also,
she cheated on you.

182
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,467
"I'm sorry you had
to find out this way.

183
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,236
(CHUCKLES)

184
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,035
"See, we're already
laughing about it."

185
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:35,048
"Dear Future Ted,
stay away from Natalie,

186
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,552
"or any girl who can
pin you to the ground

187

00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,726

a little bit."

Huh!

194
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:05,254
It doesn't look so sad
written in calligraphy.

195
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,648
OLDER TED:
So, when Barney and Robin
broke up the previous fall...

196
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,621
Dating Robin
was a huge mistake.

197
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,620
Write that down.
What?

198
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,122
Write yourself a letter.

199
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,263
That way, when you
miss Robin, and you will,

200
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,659
you can
remind yourself
why you broke up.

201
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,761
Gladly.

202
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,030
"Dear Future Barney..."

203
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,333
Ooh!

204
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,604
This ink is cool.

205
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,643
Right? Right?

206
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,568
"You and Robin..."

207
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,374
"Were a terrible couple.

208
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,535
"It just didn't work.
Sure, you'll always

Then there's
just a bunch of
drawings of boobs.

215
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,027
You get it now?
Yeah, I get it.

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,240
I definitely want her back.

(SIGHS)

218
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,071
I don't think human beings
were ever meant to sleep
in the same bed.

219
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,807
Somehow sex and sleep
got all jumbled together,

220
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,343
but they're two
different things.

221
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:14,108
I know.
I mean, I love you,
but I want this new bed

222
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,377
to be a sanctuary for
sleep and sleep alone.

223
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,387
Me, too. And some
light snacking,
but that's it.

224
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,662
Hey, you know
what we should get?

225
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:26,931
We should get a third bed
just for sex.

226
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,100
Yes! A sex bed!
A dirty, dirty sex bed!

227
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,000
It's genius. That way
each bed would have
a specific purpose.

228
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,743
Exactly. We'll have
two sleep beds, a sex bed,

229
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,040
and I'm thinking
a bean bag chair,

230
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,311
just for
special birthday stuff.

231
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,180
Baby, did we just
revolutionize modern marriage?

232
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,010
Damn straight!

Hey, guys.
Hey, Don.

00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:53,922
I hope you like sushi.

237
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,724
How cool is it
that Don makes sushi?

238
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,756
He learned while on
assignment in Japan.

239
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,632
Ringworm-ilicious.

240
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,060
Barney, be nice.
You only want her
'cause you can't have her.

241
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,667
It's like if I said
you can sit anywhere

242
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,899

except that chair.

243

Are you so petty that...
My chair! My chair!

244
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,244
Oh, spicy tuna with
jalapeno! My favorite!

245
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,214
Mine, too.
I love spicy food.
The hotter the better.

00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:19,383
I love
spicy stuff, too, guy.
Probably more than you do.

Super mild.

250
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,656
I'm not feeling it.

251
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,329
Hey, Lily,
you won't believe it,
it's the craziest thing.

252
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,089
Don has twin beds, too.

253
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,997
Oh, my God!
We just got twin beds.

254
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,869
Oh, Oh. Great, great.

255
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,299
Well, wait, that "great"
didn't sound so great.

256
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,244
Well, my ex-wife and I
thought they'd be
a good idea,

257
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,710
but we just started
to drift apart. So...

258
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,540
Yeah, but
I bet you didn't have
another bed just for sex.

259
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,876
No, but she did at her
personal trainer's house.

260
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,823
This chili is like
an ice cube in my mouth.

I will say this, though.

get a king-size bed if

you ever do this

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,820
It was bold and romantic.

280
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,523
You soiled yourself
from both ends of your body.

281
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:40,085
Oh, come on!
You have done tons of
stupid stuff to impress Robin.

282
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,057
Yeah, I did,
but I don't anymore,
'cause I'm over her.

283
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,426
Just like you are.
You are not over her.

284
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,125
You want her back
just as much as I do.

285
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,437
You just won't
let yourself go there.

286
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,768
That is ridiculous.
And I'll tell you why.

deserved Robin more.

I wanted her to be
the mother of my children

and spend eternity
in her arms.

have sex with her
at least one more time!

the food and the ants.

But, well,
I still wanna
be next to you.

333
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,812
Why? So you can kick
me and slap me all night?

I swear to God,
the second you
fall asleep,

335

it's like you
grow extra limbs.

336
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,249
It's like spooning
with a Hindu deity,
Ganesh!

337
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,286
Wanna push them together?

338
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,250
You still talking
about the beds?

339
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,158
Nope.

Robin Stinson!

342
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,797
Ted Scherbatsky!
I'll take her name.

343
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,059
I don't care.

344
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,328
Okay. Wait.
How about this?
How about this?

345
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,466
We share her.

346
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:40,172
I'll take her until she's 40,
and then you can have her
after that.

347
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,177
Okay, who
are we kidding?
She's with Don now.

348
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,450
We just have to accept that,
and move on.

349
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,108
You're right.

350
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,177
I'm gonna go to the...
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

351
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,047
and then I'll skedaddle.

353
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,690
Hello?

354
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,885
Hey, Robin,
it's Barn Door.
Guess what? I'm open.

Hey, Barn Door, hang on.
I'm getting another call.

Hello?

358
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,898

No. Ted, hang on.

00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,477
Okay.

362
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,549
Hey, Barney,
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

363
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,778
Ted's on the other line,
and I think he's in trouble.

364
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,354
Ted's calling you?
He's in trouble,
all right!

365
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,946
Ted, what's up?

366
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,487
You have pretty hair.
That's what's up.

367
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,293
And down your back.

Wow. We almost let
that get out of control.

371
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,472
Agreed.

372
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,374
I'm gonna get out of here
before we do something
we regret.

373
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,937
Robin! Robin, I love you!

374
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,407
You son of a bitch!

375
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,605
Robin!

Robin, I brought you
the blue French horn!

377

I brought you
the blue French horn!

378
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,354
Robin, Ted's just
holding it for me.

Sorry, buddy, all's fair.

Oh, God. Guys,
what are you doing?

381
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,758
Robin, I wanna win you back!

Hey, guys.
Why don't you
come upstairs?

383
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:12,768
Right.

You, me and Ted!

Yeah! A three-way.

Look, guys,
Robin and I have
to go do our show,

388
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,384
so why don't you have a seat
on the couch, watch some
television,

389
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,524
and we'll
talk about this
when we get back, okay?

390
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,919
Wow, you give up easy.
Game, set, match.

Oh, I'm sorry.
That was a blast.
And you're great.

be up early, so...

Well, you're
just kicking me out?

Rise and shine, jackasses!

411
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,987
So, do you guys remember
anything from last night?

412
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,122
Yeah.

413
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:48,198
Boy, was Ted drunk.
Embarrassing.

414
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,897
I'm really sorry.
We both are.

415
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,597
We were drunk and stupid.

416
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,341
But we're gonna
do anything we can

417
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,612
to make sure that Don
feels a part of the group.

418
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,579
Don's not gonna be
a part of the group.

419
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:06,752
And neither am I.

420
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,748
At least for a while.

421
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,552
Guys, this thing
with Don is real.

422
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,816
And I wanna see where it goes.

423
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,285
And I'll never
be able to do that
if I keep hanging out

424
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,285
with my ex-boyfriends
all the time.

425
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,487
It just won't work.

426
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,667
I'm moving in with Don.

00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,522
* It should be boredom by now

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,320
* I know the tricks

429
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,727
So, what's going on
with Robin?

430
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,959
You were right.
She was just mad.

431
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,864
It's been four days,
she hasn't said another
word about moving out.

432
00:19:56,896 --> 00:20:00,466
But listen, we can never
pull crap like that
ever again.

433
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,070
Agreed. In fact, I even
wrote myself another letter.

really don't.

00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,916

was just for Ted.
