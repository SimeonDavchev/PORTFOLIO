Kids, the secret to
dating is very simple.

be comfortable

a lot of the time, who
he was was someone else.

Hi. You see that guy
over there in the scuba suit?

7
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:25,992
You thinking of
going and talking to him?

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,026
No.

9
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:31,172
Good. He's seriously
the biggest jerk on
the face of the Earth.

10

How do you know him?
He's one of my best friends.

11
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,998
So, what's with
the scuba suit?

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,966
Well, it's a long story.

13
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,205
See, he just went
through a breakup.

I haven't used as
much as I would like to.

30
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,322
It's kind of big,

Hi. Shelly,
I hate to be forward,

180
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,505
but can I
buy you a cup of coffee?

181
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,183
Yes, please.

182
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,720
What does coffee go
for these days, $50?

183
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:35,878
Oh! Lorenzo.

184
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,420
BARNEY: "And it is on."

185
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,015
That's awful!

186
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,187
You realize you broke
her heart, right?

187
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,486
She's inconsolable.

188
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,057
Why would she
be inconsolable?

189
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:53,697
Lorenzo's balloon
won't disappear over
the Arctic for another week.

190
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,504
The only way
she would be upset

191
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,165
is if someone told her
it was all a bunch of lies.

192
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,135
It was all just
a bunch of lies?

193
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,183
It was all just
a bunch of lies.

194
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,339
The balloon expedition?
Lies!

195
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,307
The man-made island
shaped like his face,

196
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,816
off the coast of Dubai?
Lies!

197
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,019
Finishing third in the
laser tag competition?

198
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,851
Oh! Actually, that
one's true. I went to that.

199
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,057
You went to the Vatican?
Lies!

200
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:22,858
Oh, my God!
Well, I hope you're
happy with yourself!

201
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,726
What?
You broke that girl's heart.

202
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,166
Me?
You!

203
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,401
She'll probably
never trust a guy again.

204
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,307
You ruined her for Ted,

205
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,339
not to mention
Julio Von Matterhorn,
Lorenzo's twin brother.

206
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,175
Can you believe that?
He blames me!

207
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,584
And by the way, Ted,
I bet she'd still
go out with you.

208
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:47,217
Hmm. Let me think,
do I wanna go out with
a girl Barney hooked up with?

209
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,994
Guys, help me out
with the harmonies.
Sure.

210
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,622
* Hell, no
* Hell, no

211
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,358
* Hell, no

212
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,832
* Hell, no

213
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,733
Well, you must be
a little bothered
by this?

214
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:58,995
Well, it's his life.

215
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,872
Look, if these
girls are dumb enough

216
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,371
to fall
for this crap,
they have it coming.

217
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,742
Agreed. Have you seen the one
in there labeled "The SNASA"?

218
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,211
Wow, you're an astronaut?

219
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:15,583
(SHUSHING) I'm
actually in a top-secret
government space program

220
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,985
called "Secret NASA"
or "SNASA."

221
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,590
Wow. "SNASA."
Mmm-hmm.

222
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,322
Do you go to
the moon and stuff?

223
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,027
Well, not the moon
you're familiar with.

224
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,499
Though, I have
been to the "smoon."

225
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,070
Wow. The "smoon."

226
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,243
If you fall for that one,
my heart breaks for you,

227
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,371
but I'm sorry,
you're a "smoron."

228
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:42,875
So, what happens next?

229
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,040
(SIGHING) Well...

230
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,377
Come on, Barney. You just...

231
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:50,884
You just got out of
an honest-to-God relationship.

232
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:55,088
You're a real boy now.
You can't go back to
these cheap tricks.

233
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,632
Cheap tricks?
Not one of these
is a cheap trick.

234
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,158
Except for
"The Cheap Trick."

235
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,595
I'm the
bass player
for Cheap Trick.

236
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,967
And even that one involves
expensive hair extensions.

237
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,713
Now, if you don't mind,

238
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,669
I am off to prepare
for tonight's main event.

239
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:17,137
I will be performing
"The He's Not Coming."

240
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,607
Glad you asked.

241
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,851
BARNEY: "To perform
'The He's Not Coming,'
here's what you'll need.

242
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,924
"The observation deck
of the Empire State Building.

243

"So, all you have to do is
walk up to every girl you
see, and say..."

247
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,997
He's not coming.

248
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,472
What are you talking about?

249
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,870
Never mind.

250
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,242
He's not coming.

251
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,673
He's not coming.

252
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,438
She's not coming? Sorry.

253
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,510
BARNEY: "Until
sooner or later..."

(SIGHING)

255
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,846
He's not coming.

256
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:03,316
He's not?
But we agreed.

257
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,556
We always said
we'd meet here,
on this night.

258
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,003
(GASPS)

259
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,598
(CRYING) I'm such a fool.

260
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,710
All right,
I'm gonna go
get the paper.

261
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,738
More like go get a husband.
Yeah, totally.

262
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,014
Okay, you guys,
just stop that,
seriously.

263
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,413
The last thing
I'm looking for
right now is a relationship.

264
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,845
Uh-huh. When you
pick up that newspaper,

265
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,750
be sure to check
the wedding announcements

266
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,322
for yours.

267
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,750
MARSHALL:
Robin, it's like this.

268
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,885
Do you have any idea
how many times in my life

269
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,491
I've gone to the freezer
looking for frozen waffles
and not found them?

270
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,493
Thousands?
Millions.

271
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:42,325
But when I go to the freezer
looking for a Popsicle or
the remote control,

272
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,402
because Lily
and I are having a fight
and she's hidden it there,

273
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,031
you know what I find?

274
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,296
Frozen waffles.

275
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,335
That's how it works.
If you go out there,
looking for a paper,

276
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,870
you're coming back
with frozen waffles,

277
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,705
and in this case,
frozen waffles
is a guy.

278
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:59,051
Also, could you pick up
some frozen waffles?

279
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,679
In that case,
frozen waffles
are frozen waffles.

280
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,216
(TED CHUCKLING)

281
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:08,192
Guys, code red,
emergency, lockdown!

282
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,321
Nobody's leaving!
What happened?

283
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:14,057
I tried
the "He's Not Coming,"
and it worked, gangbusters.

284
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,664
You should have seen
this girl.

285
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,655
(VOCALIZING)

286
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,297
Okay, I'm leaving.

287
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,873
So, we get up to my place,
and I go into my room to
set up the camera...

288
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,514
To light the candles.

289
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:31,879
And when I
come out, she's gone,
and so is The Playbook.

290
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,812
I think we all know
who is responsible
for this.

291
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,078
Yeah, we do.

292
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,186
Yeah. Al-Qaeda.

293
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:42,262
No, you idiot! It was me.

294
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,357
You son of a bitch!

295
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,041
Wow, you stole The Playbook?

296
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,070
So the girl on the
Empire State Building?

297
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,706
A friend of mine,
an actress.

298
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,740
An actress, of course!

299
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:07,046
That explains her
impeccable diction
and her sluttiness.

300
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,720
Barney, I've
got half a mind to
take that Playbook

301
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,149
and put it
up on the Internet for
the whole world to see.

302
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,715
You wouldn't!
I won't,

303
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:16,493
as long
as you agree
to no more scams,

304
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,363
no more cons,
no more hustles,

305
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,191
no more hoodwinks,
no more gambits,

306
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,227
no more stratagems
and no more bamboozles.

(SIGHING)

308
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,227
I noticed you
left out flimflams.

309
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,565
No more flimflams!

310
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,339
Damn it!

311
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,098
Oh, my God. I'm sorry to
interrupt, but look at this.

312
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,107
No!

313
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,184
I got left
at the altar.

314
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,053
Oh, my God,
that's horrible!

315
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,716
Wonder if that would work.

316
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,564
That's not even
the worst one in there.

317
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,129
Have you guys seen
"The My Penis Grants Wishes"?

318
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,957
Really? A genie
comes out of it?

319
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,767
Only if you
rub it hard enough.

320
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,068
So, then what happened?

321
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,313
It says here,
"He breaks into song,

322
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,968
"and then
the furniture comes to
life and dances with him."

323
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,907
It's not
very well thought out.
It's no Mrs. Stinsfire.

324
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,743
No, what happened in
real life?

325
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,548
Well, a few hours later...

326
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,850
(LOUD BANGING ON DOOR)

327
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,718
You know,
I heard it was gonna rain.

328
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,556
If anyone's interested,
I will be at MacLaren's Pub

329
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,533
performing a play
out of The Playbook
entitled, "The Scuba Diver."

330
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,103
That is all.

331
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,744
Okay, that's it.

332
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,368
I'm putting
The Playbook up
on the Internet.

333
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,336
Baby, can you
put The Playbook
up on the Internet?

334
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,084
Yeah, of course, baby.
But here's the weird thing,

335
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,811
I've literally
been through this
book cover to cover.

336
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,546
There's no play in here
called "The Scuba Diver."

337
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:55,687
Oh! So, now
you guys wanna know
what "The Scuba Diver" is?

338
00:15:55,722 --> 00:16:00,162
Well, it was on the
last page of The Playbook,

339
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,333
but I ripped it out,
just in case.

340
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,033
Don't worry, though.
You're about to see
it in action.

341
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,336
See the blonde
over there by the bar?

342
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,312
Tizzarget aquizired.

343
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,839
Barney, don't do this.

344
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,213
God, give it a rest, pest.

345
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,313
If anyone should be mad,
it should be Robin.

346
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,675
She loves The Playbook.
I don't love The Playbook.

347
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,724
What are you...
The Playbook, it's gold.

348
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,391
You gotta admit,
it's pretty spectac.

349
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,159
Look, Barney,
we just broke up.

350
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:33,389
I mean, yes,
the costumes are cute,
but we just broke up.

351
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,669
Well, I didn't know
you felt that way.

352
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,740
I guess I've
been so wrapped up
in my own stuff that I...

353
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,409
Oh, crap,
she's looking over here.
Quick, everyone, scatter.

354
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,008
(SIGHING) That's it.

355
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,221
Hi. You see that guy
over there in the
scuba suit?

356
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,878
And that brings
us to right now.

357
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,016
Wow.

358
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:02,592
But wait. So, why is
he wearing scuba gear?

359
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,562
We don't know and
it's killing us, Claire.

360
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:06,862
It's killing us.

361
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,833
Well, let's go ask him.

362
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:15,071
So what's "The Scuba Diver"?
And this is Claire,
by the way.

363
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,369
Hello, Claire. My name
is Lieutenant Frank Lyman.

364
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,206
I train
bomb-sniffing
dolphins for the...

365
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,913
You know what?

366
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:29,175
(STUTTERING)
I can't do this.

367
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,916
Robin, I am so sorry.

368
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:37,522
I guess this breakup's been
tougher on me than I thought.

369
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,787
I think this Playbook was
just a way to take my
mind off of things.

370
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,904
It's okay.
It's been tough on me, too.

371
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,000
I mean, look at me.
I've sworn off relationships.

372
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,172
She's so about
to get married.

373
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
I gotta work on my toast.

374
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:49,838
I gotta make
sure my tux fits.

375
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,409
I will bang your heads
together like coconuts.

376
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,980
Barney, I'm so glad
you're stopping this.

377
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,508
And, frankly, the real
Barney is way cooler than

378
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,846
any of
the fake Barneys
in this Playbook.

379
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,221
Is that right?

380
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,351
Claire, you've probably heard
a lot about the real Barney
tonight.

381
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,716
Wanna grab
a cup of coffee?

382
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,894
Okay, Claire,
before you turn him down,

383
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,662
I think you should know
that under this
neoprene suit,

384
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,903
with what appears
to be a tube sock
stuffed in the crotch...

385
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,799
Can of Pringles, but go on.

386
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,171
...is an amazing guy.

387
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:26,171
He's fun and
one of my best friends
and he landed this hottie.

388
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,914
He's a good guy.

389
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,380
Come on, Claire,
go out with him.

390
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,982
MARSHALL: It's just
a cup of coffee, right?

391
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,583
Yeah, come on.
Yeah, it can't hurt.

392
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,545
All right, all right.
Let's get some coffee.

393
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,557
OLDER TED: And by
the end of the night...

394
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,430
I'm proud of that guy.

395
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,588
To be that vulnerable
takes a lot of Pringles.

396
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,997
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

397
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:52,398
Whoo! I got
a text from Barney.
"Look under the table."

(LILY EXCLAIMS)

399
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,665
It's a page
from The Playbook.

400
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,136
What's it say?

401
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,114
It's "The Scuba Diver."

402
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,583
BARNEY: "Step one,
tell a meddlesome female
friend about The Playbook.

Shh.

Robin, here we go.

You say you don't
want a relationship.

423
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,709
Well, the love of your life
is about to walk through
the door, and it's

that guy.

425

Yeah, I'm not falling
in love with that guy.

Right, right, right.
'Cause it's gonna
be that guy.

I don't know, the blue blazer
is just, like, not doing it
for me, so...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're right 'cause
here he comes.

It's that guy.

430
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,330
Robin, you should at least
give her a chance.

431
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,726
You know, make out
with her a little.

432

See if there's
something there.

Okay, I'm going to work.
Yeah, you are.
