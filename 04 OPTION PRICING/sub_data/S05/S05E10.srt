After they broke up,
I only waited a week.

76
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:10,724
I was still too late.
She dated that guy
for three years.

I wasn't messing around.

was go downstairs
and check her mail.

And she dated that guy
for four years.

let this happen again,

85

she and David broke up.

with a female driver

I barely grazed
the bottom of the net,

345
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,242
and now my legs hurt so bad,
I can't even fall down.

346
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,909
(LAUGHING) Wow!

347
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,576
How could you?

348
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,253
Ted, I challenged myself
to get laid wearing overalls.

349
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,784
And if you stand in my way,
then you're letting
Barney win.

350
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,989
And you don't want that.

351
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,222
That smug son of a bitch
will never let us hear
the end of it.

352
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,157
Oh, thank God. Maggie...

353
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,592
Where do you think
you're going?

354
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,287
To tell that girl
I love her.
Get in line, bub.

355
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,729
Yeah. I'm going to
have sex with her,

356
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,864
then he's going to tell her
he's in love with her,

357
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,129
and then you can do
whatever you want.
Do we agree on the order?

358
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,640
Mister! You just missed out
on the night of your life.

359

(PANTING)
The night of your life.

360
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,224
I've been in love with her
for five years.

361
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,081
I've been in love with her
for 12 years.

362
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,590
I've been in these overalls
for an hour and a half.

363
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,685
Hey, maybe you can't
dunk anymore,

364
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,157
but you've achieved
more in your 30 years

365
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:03,397
than that 15-year-old dweeb
could ever dream of.

366
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,603
You put yourself through
Columbia Law School.

367
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,365
You had the sense
to chop off that
stupid rat tail.

368
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,965
And you married
a smoking-hot chick

369

who looks nothing
like your mother.

370
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,576
I think that earns you
an entire foot closer
to dunking.

There you go,

How about instead of dunking,
we go up to your office,

376
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,010
and you lie very still
while I go bananas
all over you?

maybe instead just
do it right here?

378
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,106
Sure, baby.

we have to figure
this out.

We are dealing with
a very small window
of opportunity here.

382
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,550
Guys, let me assure you,
if you let me in there,

383
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,019
that window's
gonna open up again
in, like, 10 minutes.

Wait, where's Maggie?
She's gone.

385
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,459
What?
I sent her home.

fighting over her.

No, she's right.

Maggie deserves
some time to herself.

Nobody likes to be alone,
especially after a breakup,

392

but that's when we discover
who we really are

393
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,646
and what we really want.

394
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,453
She deserves that.

were so hot.

they were too hot.
