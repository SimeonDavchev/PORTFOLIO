00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:05,435
OLDER TED: Kids,
we all have different ways
of dealing with nerves.

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,306
It'll just be
a few more minutes,
Mr. Stinson.

3
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,706
OLDER TED:
Some people
chew their nails.

4
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,447
Some people
tap their feet.

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,183
And some people imagine
they're being interviewed
by renowned sportscaster,

6
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,879
Jim Nantz.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,120
Hello, friends.
Every sport has had an icon
who transcends the game.

8
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,659
Boxing had Ali,
basketball had Jordan,

9
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,464
and the sport of sleeping
with random hotties

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,097
has my next guest,
Mr. Barney Stinson.

11
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,033
Barney, welcome.
Thanks, Jim.

12
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,099
Great to be back
on the show.
Good to have you with us.

13
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,567
And, you know, the stats,
they really speak
for themselves.

14
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,436
Over 200 women,
spanning six continents,

15
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:42,406
17 nationalities,
74 sexual positions,

16
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,076
and not a single fatty.
It's impressive.

17
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,046
And with all these
accomplishments though,

18
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:49,675
there's one laurel
that's always eluded you,

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,690
which brings us to last week.
What was the story there?

20
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:55,963
Buckle up, Jimbo.
This one's a doozy.

21
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:58,933
BARNEY: It all started
when I decided to set
myself a little challenge.

22
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,292
Oh, my God.

23
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,631
Whoa!
He's calling his shot.

24
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,096
Whatever girl I'm
pointing to right now,

25
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,596
that's who I'm going
home with tonight.

26
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,797
And,

27
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,567
play ball!

28
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,177
Hey.
Hey.

29
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:17,783
Hey. How'd the date
with Dale go?

30
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,505
You know, sometimes that guy,
with the horn-rimmed glasses

31
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,221
and a Smurfs T-shirt,
is just being ironic.

32
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:26,294
Sometimes he is a dork
with a lazy eye

33
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:28,894
and a love-hate
relationship
with Gargamel.

34
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:32,526
Robin, just because a guy
talks a lot about a fictional
character on a first date,

35
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,463
doesn't mean he's not
husband material.

36
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,658
Sasquatch isn't fictional.

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,200
TED: That was quick.

38
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,442
So, night one
was pretty routine.

39
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:48,335
Jim, there's nothing routine
about the way I get down.

40
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,939
Respect.
Take us to night two.

41
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,981
See that hotty over there
nursing a Black Russian?

42
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,477
She's about to chase that
with a white American.
Up top!

43
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,892
You know,
if you're not careful,
you're gonna lose me.

44
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:07,202
Hey, guys, what should
I say when Dale calls
for a second date?

45
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,461
How do you know
he's gonna call?

46
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,559
(LAUGHING)

47
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,029
You're cute, Marshall,

48
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,400
but I think Mama knows
when a dude's digging
the show.

49
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,640
I mean, he couldn't keep
his good eye off of me.

50
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,537
Well, let him down easy.
People are fragile.

51
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,710
Sometimes without
even meaning to,

52
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:28,618
you might rip someone's
beating heart out
and stomp on it

53
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:32,292
in a roomful of 26 people
and a teacher's assistant.

54
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,023
How did school
go today, Ted?

55
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,457
Something bad happened.

56
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,694
It was the first class
of the new semester.

57
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,259
Jamie Adamic? Hi.

58
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,270
Brian Glowatz,
Glowatz? Hi.

59
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,112
Well done.
Adding a fake name
to the sign-up sheet.

60
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,042
That's real original, guys.

61
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,908
You know, I'd expect
inspired minds such as yours
to be a little more mature

62
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,709
and, frankly,
more creative.

63
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,351
I mean, seriously,

64
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,816
what kind of
a fake name
is Cook Pu?

65
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,585
Here.

66
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:10,194
Come on, guys.
It's gotta at least
sound real. Cook Pu?

67
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,188
Here.

68
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:16,161
Whatever happened
to classics, right.
You know, Seymour Butts?

69
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,030
Hugh Gerection?
Those were fake names.
But Cook Pu?

70
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,200
(CRYING) Here.

71
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,469
Cook Pu!

72
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,667
She's back here, bro.

73
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,109
All right, come on.
Let me have it.

74
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,077
Bring on all
the Cook Pu jokes.

75
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,715
Oh, we're not gonna
make jokes, Ted.

76
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,592
That girl must be
really down
in the dumps.

77
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,751
You really smeared
the Pu name.

78
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,718
You guys finished?

79
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,690
Are you asking us
if all the Pu is
out of our system?

80
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:50,555
Wow, back-to-back nights.
Barney is on fire.

81
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,331
(SIGHING)
That girl's lucky.

82
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,670
Barney was the best sex
I ever had.

83
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,595
And he's the best friend
I've ever had.

84
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,410
He's everything
I want Marshall to be.

85
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,142
He's everything
I wish I could be.

86
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,307
I'm just assuming
that's what they say
when I'm not around.

87
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,407
I buy it.
You're awesome.

88
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,119
Now, night three.
Paint us a word picture.

89
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,621
Jim, I could tell
I was on a roll,

90
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:13,454
so I decided to mix
things up a little bit.

91
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:17,161
I think I'm gonna go
small boobs tonight.

92
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,464
You're disgusting.

93
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,756
Lily, they're people, too.

94
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,367
Here's your burgers.
Thank you.

95
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,272
Thanks.
You're welcome.

96
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,974
What, you're not sharing?
You two always
share a burger.

97
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,365
No, we don't.

98
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,097
We're not, like, weirdos
who share everything.

99
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,441
Yeah, you are.
That's exactly
what you are.

100
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,506
We're perfectly normal!

101
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,805
Guys, what's going on?

102
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,107
You know how Lily and I
have been looking
for new couple friends

103
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,649
ever since we lost
Robin and Barney,
and Ted and Stella,

104
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,216
and Ted and Robin,
and Ted and Victoria?

105
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,115
Geez, Ted,
when are you gonna
get your life together?

106
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,787
How'd we end up here?

107
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,956
We went on a great
double date last night.

108
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,195
We were cool.
We were casual.
We didn't spaz out.

109
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,832
And then one tiny
little detail came out

110
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,528
and the whole night
was ruined.
Ruined!

111
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,201
And Joanna's toothbrush
flips off the side
of the sink,

112
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,340
hits the ceiling
and falls right
into the toilet.

113
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:08,076
Come on.
That's crazy.

114
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,381
Last week,
the same thing happened
to our toothbrush.

115
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,975
"Our" toothbrush?

116
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,946
"Our" toothbrush?

117
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,645
"Our" toothbrush?

118
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,490
Yeah.

119
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,952
Like, one toothbrush?

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,390
That you both use?

121
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,116
Every day?

122
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,831
Is that weird?

123
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:29,003
ALL: Super weird.

124
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,532
Marshall, four out of
five dentists just threw up
in their mouths.

125
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,229
(ROBIN SHUDDERS IN DISGUST)

126
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,370
Hey, check it out.
Barney's leaving
with another girl.

127
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:39,167
Wow, three girls
in three nights?

128
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,969
That's gross
even for Barney.

129
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,081
Gross? Are you kidding?
He's on his way
to a Perfect...

130
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:46,853
Oh! (MUTTERING)
Don't say it!
You'll jinx it.

131
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,184
Jinx what?

132
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,848
I was on my way toward

133
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,348
a Perfect Week!

134
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,700
The Perfect Week.

135
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,909
Seven nights,
seven girls,
zero rejections.

136
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:15,542
Incredible. I mean,
it's really like
the sexual equivalent

137
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,879
of baseball's perfect game.
But even rarer.

138
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:21,675
Yeah. The only player
in history to have
ever achieved both

139
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,149
was Mustache Pete Drexel,
back in 1896.

140
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,662
Now this wasn't
the first time you'd come
close to a Perfect Week.

141
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,485
You learn the hard way,
though.

142
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,731
One mistake,
and it's all over.

143
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:40,927
NANTZ:
Sometimes, a teammate
makes an error.

144
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,471
Sometimes,
one wild pitch...

00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:47,107
You, me,
the canned-food aisle
in the bodega next door.

146
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,784
...leads to a walk.

147
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:53,153
And sometimes,
you just lose focus,

148
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,883
and it almost always
leads to a hit.

149

150
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,618

you were three-for-three,

with no sign
of slowing down.

152
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,059

Wish I could say the same
for my friends.

Cook didn't show up
for class today.

155
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,270
I'm sorry, Cook?

156
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:15,742
Yeah, Ted, we know, like,
a ton of people named Cook.

157
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,973
Yeah.

00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:19,972

that guy call?

Wait a minute,
you want him to call?

165
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,126
No. Shut up.

166
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,962
Don't you guys have, like,
a toothbrush to share,
or something?

167
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,699
Yeah. When did
you guys even start
doing that anyway?

168
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,425
Like, years ago.
You should know.
We lived with you.

169
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,671
Yeah, but you always
kept your toothbrush
in the bedroom.

00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,807
Also weird,
by the way.

171
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,942
No, we kept it
in the bathroom.

172
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,677
No. There was only one
toothbrush in the bathroom,
and it was mine.

173
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:06,588
Wait. Are you saying
that for eight years,

174
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,224
all three of you
shared one toothbrush?

So, you're through
four nights.
You're over the hump.

178
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,301
Nice, Jim.

179
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,239
Hey, I try.
I'm no you.

180
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,505
But then came night five,
and with it, trouble.

181
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:31,854

182
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,346
Thanks.

Hey, how's Barney
doing tonight?

Cool as a cucumber,
just like he's been
all week.

Yeah? That's hard
to believe.

186

Why?

187
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,356
Apparently, this big merger
fell through last week,

188
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,928
and Barney's being
blamed for it.

189
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,267
That's weird.
He hasn't said anything.

190
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,802
Look, I work with the guy.
I didn't find out until
this afternoon,

191
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,638
when I walked by
his boss's office.

192
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:59,014
You cost this company,
Stinson!

193
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,512
MARSHALL:
I've never seen
Barney look that scared.

194
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,605
I think he's
gonna get fired.

195
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,652
I can't believe
Barney might get fired.

196
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,261
Yeah, they're having
a meeting on Friday

197
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,522
to determine
whether or not
he keeps his job.

198
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,731
Poor guy.
He must be freaking out.

199
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,603
I'm gonna go
talk to him.
Wait, no!

the man in the middle

looks the dumbest?

All right, kid.
Let's check the
scouting report.

217

Hmm? Oh!

223
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,606
Yeah, he's gonna
take a swat at that
hamburglar over there.

224
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,713
You were supposed
to talk to him
about losing his job.

225
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,806
Lily, how is forcing him
to dwell on a problem
he can do nothing about

226

gonna help him?

227
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,276
How is ignoring it
gonna solve anything?

228
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,878
Well, you ignored good
dental hygiene for the
better part of a decade

I have to ask.

the game too much.

the question, okay.

talk about this.

337
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,762
Barney's screwed.

338
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,333
It's happening. Look.

339
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,562
Hey, wanna come over
and look at my
snow globe collection?

340
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,129
Snow globe collection?

341
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,467
He's throwing
junk out there!

342
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,967
That is Nick Swisher.

343
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,097
(ALL GROANING)

344
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,841
Good effort.
Good game. Good game.

345
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,135
Good game.
Good game.

346
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,007
Not good enough.

347
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,406
This whole week
was a waste.

348
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,482
And tomorrow,
I'm gonna get fired.

349
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,722
I'm really sorry, dude.

350
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,687
But for what it's worth,
this week wasn't a waste.

351
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,987
We were all having
a really horrible week

352
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,431
and you took
our minds off it.

353
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,325
Yeah. I had my first
student drop my class.
It sucked.

354
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,968
I met my soul mate
and he never
called me back.

355
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:45,044
I mean, yet.
He will. He will.

356
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:48,835
We scared off a really
great couple just because
we share a toothbrush.

357
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,078
You share
a toothbrush!

358
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,354
Well, them and Ted.

359
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,512
What?

360
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,550
Wait a second.

361
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,415
When we were dating
you borrowed that
toothbrush all the time.

362
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,115
Oh, my God.

363
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,788
OLDER TED: And that's when
Aunt Lily realized what's
great about sports.

364
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,756
They take your mind
off your troubles,
if only for a moment.

365
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,526
And deep down,
we all needed
that Perfect Week.

366
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,532
TED: The second
she sits down next to
Swisher it's all over.

367
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,208
Wait a minute!
Aldrin's got
a bead on her!

368
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:30,675
She's running out of room.
She dives, and...

369
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,450
And I have no idea
where she's going
with this.

370
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,919
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

371
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,686
Yeah. Sorry,
I'm such a klutz.

372
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:40,286
Oh! Thanks.
(GROANING) I think
I twisted my ankle.

373
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,730
Can you get me some ice?

374
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,434
Of course.

375
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,426
Oh, my God. She did it!
I guess there is no
such thing as a jinx!

376
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,609
Oh, I'll get you
some ice, Lily.

377
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,035
Damn it!
Swisher's back in play.

378
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:58,951
Swisher's back in play!

379
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,851
Follow me.

380
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,553
Hey, Nick Swisher,
this guy and his wife
share a toothbrush!

381
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:09,187
So?
So, that's weird, right?

382
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,356
Actually, I think
it's kind of sweet.

383
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,794
In a way, aren't we all
trying to find that
special someone

384
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,661
to share
a toothbrush with?

385
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,599
Excuse me.
Lily, Nick Swisher
thinks we're sweet.

386
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,197
Martini?

387
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,511
We're having a beer
with a New York Yankee.
How cool is that!

388
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,344
Oh! It's amazing.
I totally follow
baseball.

389
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,980
Mookie Wilson,
is that a thing?

390
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,805
Yeah, baseball,
it's amazing.

391
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,821
But I tell you one thing,
it's no hockey.

392
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,320
I live right upstairs.

393
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,459
What do you say
we go back
to my place?

394
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:49,355
(CHUCKLES)
Wow, to be honest,
I don't normally do that,

395
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,499
but I feel a real
connection here,
Seven. Christy.

396
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,567
Please.

397
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,811
I did it!

398
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,136
(ALL CHEERING)

399
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,782
I did it!

400
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,954
Amazing!
Congratulations on
your Perfect Week.

401
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,421
Thanks, Jim.
I couldn't have done it
without my teammates.

402
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,530
Hey, on to a new topic.

403
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,692
Do you really think
you might get fired today?

404
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,759
(STAMMERING)

405
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,571
Jim, I... I told you
I don't want to talk
about that.

406
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,574
Barney, I'm a figment
of your imagination,

407
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,367
so, apparently, you do.
Think about that.

408
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,811
What a jerk!

409
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:37,676
You're a jerk.

410
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,353
Mr. Donovan
will see you now.

411
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,716
Stinson, we've
reached a decision.

412
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,686
We're keeping you on.

413
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,528
(SIGHING)

414
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,233
I know this past week
must've been tough on you.

415
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:00,166
(CHUCKLES)
I barely slept.

416
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:05,003
Here you go, guys,
the official hat of
Barney's Perfect Week.

417
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,641
I was gonna do shirts,
but then you have to
guess sizes,

418
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,107
and feelings get hurt.
It's a mess.

419
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:14,676
In commemoration
of Barney's induction
into the Hall of Game,

420
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:18,117
this tie worn on
the seventh night
of his Perfect Week

421
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,854
is hereby retired.

422
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,189
May Barney's heroic feat
be remembered and spoken of

423
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,486
for generations to come.

424
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,999
I'm totally gonna
sit my kids down
one day,

425
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,901
and tell them about the
time Uncle Barney nailed
seven chicks in a row.

426
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:32,874

OLDER TED:
Am I a bad dad?

428

Take-out order
for Cook Pu.

429
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,182
We have a number two
over here for Cook Pu.

430
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,975
You guys got Wendy
saying it now?

431
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,747
Come on, okay, I get it.
Cook Pu is a stupid name,

432
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,088
and it gets
stupider and stupider
the more you say it.

433
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,863
Cook Pu. Cook Pu. Cook Pu.

434
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,329
Here.
