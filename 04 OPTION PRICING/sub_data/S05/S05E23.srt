OLDER TED: Kids,
when you're in your 20s,
dating is great.

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:05,605
But by the time
you reach your 30s,

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,139
you find out pretty fast
everyone has baggage.

4
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:11,377
Sure you can
stick to the small talk,
and pretend it's not there,

5
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,552
but sooner or later...

00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,610
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Oh!

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:18,087
It's my ex.
Sorry, we're trying
to remain friends.

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,549
Hi, pumpkin.
Did you get our
tickets to Maui?

9
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,487
OLDER TED:
Yeah, it's there.

10
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:42,683
That spring, I had
just started dating
a girl named Royce.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,450
She was smart,
beautiful...

12
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,148
Blah, blah, blah,
we're very happy together.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,120
But...

14
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:49,178
Exactly.
That's the problem.

15
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:50,547
Her butt?

16
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,824
What is it, too much?
Too little?

17
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,092
Or is it an issue
of access?

18
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,461
(LAUGHS)

19
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,459
No. The but is,
there's always
gonna be a but.

20
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,461
No matter how great
things are going,

21
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,103
sooner or later,
it's gonna get ruined.

22
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:02,799
When she turns 30.

23
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,630
When I find out
what her baggage is.

24
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,296
It's there.
I don't know
what it is,

25
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,295
but when I do,
party's over.

26
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,237
Whoa!

27
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,542
Ted, please tell me
you are not impugning
emotional baggage.

28
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,105
Baggage is
a good thing?

29
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:18,714
Emotional baggage
is the bedrock

30
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:21,516
of America's
most important
cultural export.

00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,149
ALL: Porn.
Porn.

32
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,354
Actually, it's porn.

33
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:29,717
Only women with major
baggage go into porn.

34
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,657
Major baggage.
Major baggage.

35
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,562
Ted, everyone has baggage,
you just gotta look past it.

36
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,865
Really? 'Cause
the last time I looked
past a girl's baggage,

37
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,668
that baggage belonged
to a girl named Stella,
and...

38
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:44,471
Oh, I'm drawing a blank here.
How did that work out again?

39
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,505
OLDER TED: Here's
how it worked out.

40
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,910
I asked her to marry me,
she said yes. We were happy.

41
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,482
But then the day
of the wedding,

42
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,851
her karate instructor
ex-boyfriend,

43
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,149
Tony Grafanello, showed up,
declared his love for her,

44
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:57,693
and Stella ran off
with him to California,

45
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,648
leaving me utterly and
completely heartbroken.

46
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,718
Ted, look, what happened
with Stella was awful.

47
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,487
But that doesn't mean
anyone with baggage
is undateable.

48
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:09,297
Well, I'm just glad that
we met young enough that
I don't have any baggage.

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,900
Mother issues.
I do not.

50
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,701
Grandmother issues.
Definitely do not.

51
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,633
Great-grandmother issues.

52
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,867
I just don't like it
when she picks me up.

53
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,843
And you know what
your biggest baggage is?
You're too nice.

54
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,812
How is being
nice baggage?

55
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,481
Have you ever seen you
walk down the street?

56
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:25,682
I don't even know
how to answer that.

57
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:26,313

Let me help you with that.

60
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,361
That ought to do it.

I could not today.

There is only one street
where that is normal.

Here's a hint,
a giant yellow
bird lives on it.

67
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,451
Well, I'll be pretty happy
if Royce's only baggage
is that she's too nice.

68
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,455
Too nice?
That is the worst
kind of baggage.

69
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,658

hates her dad,

70
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,660

mention breakfast,

on my date with Royce,

75
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,565
I kept waiting to see
what her baggage would be.

76
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,974
So is spaghetti
your specialty?

00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:29,436
No. The main event
is my pancakes.

I'll make them
for you sometime.
They are insane.

multi-grain pancakes.

as though there was no

Nothing.
Forget about it.

95

We were on
our way here,

96
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:39,046
and Marshall wanted to stop
and help some guys load
their moving van.

97
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,979
To be nice.
Didn't cost nothing.

98
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,424
And when the
moving van drove away,
who should show up

of the apartment

some guys rob.

hard to explain
to the police.

this is what I mean.

In 1994, the cashier
from the feed store
was held up at hoe-point.

109
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,823
And besides, I like
being friendly, okay?

110
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,578
I'm not gonna change
that about myself.

111
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,387
No, don't change, baby.
I think it's sweet.

Sweet, sweet,
sweet mother of God.
He's an idiot sometimes.

113
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,730
He actually lent
the burglars gas money.

114
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,899
He gave them money?

115
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:31,698
Not gave, lent.
They said that they
would send us a check,

116
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,772
so Marshall gave
them our address.

117
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,942
What's to stop them
from coming to our
apartment one night,

118
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,610
and maybe tying me up?

119
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,980
I mean, sure, Marshall
and I like to pretend,
but the reality is scary.

120
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,910
Why don't you say
something to him?

121
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,145
(GROANS)
What's the point?
He's from Minnesota.

122
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,950

00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,992
Hey, how'd the date
with Royce go?

125
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,861
It was interesting.
We went to see that new
movie, The Wedding Bride.

126
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,890
Oh! How was it?

127
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:01,656
Not that I care.
I mean,
it's a chick flick.

128
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,565
This one will probably
drag me to it, like the
7:10 show tomorrow night,

129
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,099
or 9:40 because I
have that meeting,

130
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,404
but I can probably
get out of it,

131
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,736
so let's try
for the 7:10.

132
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,070
ROBIN: What's that
movie about, anyway?

133
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,414

interesting part.

leave a mark!

00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,552
It's about me.

138
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,958
The Wedding Bride
is about you?
Yeah.

139
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,564
Okay, are you sure it's
about you? Because when
I saw Spaceballs

140
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,327
for the first time,
I could've sworn...

141
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,974
This movie is
about me, Marshall.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,170
It was written
by Tony Grafanello.

143
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,512
Tony Grafanello?
That's...

144
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,668
Yeah, the guy that
Stella left me for.

00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,507

the whole story
of our breakup.

(LAUGHS) Why would
he write a movie
about that?

147

Isn't he the bad guy
in that story?

148
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,750
Yeah, and the good guy
is a guy named Ted Mosby.

149
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,054
Funny, that was my
memory of it, too.

150
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,656

to the movie...

move out of her beautiful

154
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,704
and come live with me
in an apartment above
a bar. Send her in.

do I owe the pleasure?

Whoa.

169
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,141
I'm really falling
back in my chair.

170
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,839
LILY: Baby.

171
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,511
MARSHALL: Okay,
that was pretty funny.

172
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,680
What a jerk.
Did he at least get
someone hot to play me?

173
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,650
You're not in it.
(SIGHING) What a jerk.

174
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,579
No, no, no, no, no.
Tony's not a jerk,

175
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,075
not according to
the movie, anyway.

176
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:07,957
I'm going through
with this wedding.
I'm sorry, Tony.

177
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,528
Stella, your happiness
is the only thing
I care about,

178
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:14,929
except for these
underprivileged children
that I work with for free.

179
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,132
AUDIENCE: Aw!

180
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,567
I love him.

181
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,903
It's not that
easy, Tony.

182
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,705
Jed Mosley may not be
as handsome as you are,

183
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,068
or as tall as you are...

184
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,737
I'm taller
than that guy.

185
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:32,177
...and our sex life
is terrible.

186
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,212
Once he even fell asleep
while we were doing it.
I mean...

187
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,817
It was one time.
I was on cold medicine.

188
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,650
What?
Nothing.

189
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:43,857
This is a terrible movie!
And it got everything wrong.

190
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,561
Remember how I
proposed to Stella?

191
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:49,004
TED: That spontaneous
moment in the arcade.

192
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,669
I didn't have a ring,
so I gave her a toy I won
from a crane machine?

193
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:52,329
Oh, that was so sweet.

194
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,925
So romantic.

195
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,137
A little cheesy.

196
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,109
Well, here's how
it went in the movie.

197
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:03,639
Look, if it'll shut you up,
I guess we can get married.

198
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,207
Well, aren't you
gonna give me a ring?

199
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,145
No-can-do's-ville, babydoll.

200
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,217
Here. Put this
on your finger.

201
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:11,891
Hey!

202
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,294
And remember
the two-minute date?

203
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,263
TED: When I squeezed
an entire romantic evening

204
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,891
into just two minutes
to accommodate Stella's
busy schedule?

205
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,858
Oh, Ted, you're
such a good guy.

206
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,856
That was really nice.

207
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,227
Also, a little cheesy.

208
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,196
Well, according
to the movie...

209
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,966
What about our big
romantic weekend?

210
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,174
No-can-do's-ville, babydoll.

211
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,877
Alls I got time for
is a two-minute date,
if you know what I mean.

212
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,051
Sex.

213
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,249
Whoa!

214
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,980
(THUDDING)

215
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,824
(ALL LAUGHING)

216
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:45,318
(SIGHING)

217
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,092
AUDIENCE: Aw!

218
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,690
Hey, if you know what
you're doing, two minutes
is all you need.

219
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,393
Run tell dat.

220
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:57,155
But the worst,
the worst, was the ending.
So they're at the wedding...

221
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,397
Do you, Stella,
take Jed Mosley

222
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,672
to be your
lawfully-wedded husband?

223
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:05,812
I...
Whoa! Spoilers!

224
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,609
Is what I would say
if I ever plan on seeing
such an awful film.

225
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:11,714
Continue.

226
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,318
So they're
at the wedding.

227
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,349
I...
Stella!

228
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,089
Tony!
Tony?

229
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,861
Something I need to say.

230
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:29,261
A long time ago,
I let this beautiful girl
named Stella get away.

231
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,026
And now she's
with some jerk

232
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:35,104
who doesn't appreciate
what he has in this
beautiful, wedding bride.

233
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,235
AUDIENCE: Oh!

234
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,840
What is wrong
with you people?

235
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:44,244
You can't talk
to me like that.
I'm Ted Mosley!

236
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,707
Did he say Ted
that time?

237
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,076
(SHUSHING)

238
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:50,384
Stella, I promised
to make you my wife.

239
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,947
And I'd like to live up
to that promise.

240
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:59,427
Oh, Tony, all I've wanted
all my life was your love.

241
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,129
Oh, go on, honey.
Kiss him.

242
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,361
ALL: Kiss him,
kiss him, kiss him...

243
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:08,296
Stella, if you still
truly love me,

244
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,395
can you let me make you
my wedding bride?

245
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,437
Can-do's-ville, babydoll.

246
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,448
No! No! No!
Stop doing that!

247
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,853
Daddy!

248
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,893
(GROANS)

249
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,291
Take that, Ted Mosby.

250
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,727
(ALL LAUGHING)

251
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,030
Okay, he definitely
said it that time.

252
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:41,871
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

253
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:45,812
(SIGHING)

254
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,407
Oh, my God.

255
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:53,982
That was so good!
I'm laughing.
I'm crying.

256
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:57,324
I know it's all fake,
but didn't those seem
like real characters?

257
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,420
It was just so real.

258
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,023
Hey, how come
you said "oh, no"
when the movie started?

259
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,787
OLDER TED: That's when
I realized everyone has
baggage, including me.

260
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:13,497
Oh, uh, no reason.

261
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,773
Ted, I think you
need to tell Royce

262
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,873
the story
of what happened
with you and Stella.

263
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,805
It's gonna come out
eventually.

264
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,780
Why? Why does it
even have to?

265
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,910
Well, for starters, it's now
the fifth highest-grossing
movie of all time.

266
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,124
I don't care. I don't care.
I'm taking this to the grave.

267
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,450
It's a stupid
movie, anyway.

268
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,085
Sounds terrible.

269
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,391
My gosh, I would never go
and see that film.

270
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,662
(ALL CHATTERING)

271
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,089
OLDER TED: Kids,
you know where
this is going.

272
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,896
Well, she's made
her choice.

273
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,230
Don't worry.
I won't go
to the wedding.

274
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,465
Oh, you'll go all right.

275
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,370
I'm gonna drive you there
myself and make you watch.

276
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,113
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

277
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:56,436
Billy, no! The code.

278
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,346
This is exactly
how it happened.

279
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,478
He got every part right.

280
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,123
Even that thing
with the nunchucks.

281
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,490
OLDER TED:
So I was resolved to
put The Wedding Bride

282
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,318
as far behind me
as possible.

283
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,294
Unfortunately...

284
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,461
Oh! How great was
The Wedding Bride?

285
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,089
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

286
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,564
Loved it! Loved it!
Loved it! Loved it!

287
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,362
We're going to see it
again tomorrow.

288
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,604
Ooh! Can we come?
Ted, you wanna
see it again, right?

289
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,928
Yeah. It was good.

290
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,565
"Good"? Try instant classic.
The only thing wrong with it,

291
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:25,271
and I mean,
it's such a minor flaw in
an otherwise flawless film,

292
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,575
is I just didn't get
why Stella would even wanna
marry a guy like Jed Mosley

293
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:33,408
in the first place.
I mean, even that
guy's name, Jed Mosley.

294
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,376
Come on, Royce.
You've dated a few
Jed Mosleys in your day.

295
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,546
Well, okay.
But who hasn't?

296
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,185
He's such a type.
The butterfly tattoo,

297
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,491
the way he pronounces
encyclopedia.

298
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,533
Encyclopaedia.
Encyclopaedia.

299
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,458
Totally. Totally.

300
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,564
All right,
well, technically,
that is the correct...

301
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:53,096
I was so, so happy
when that loser got left at
the altar, and you know why?

302
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,143
Because he
had it coming.
Mmm-hmm.

303
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,538
And the great part
is he is gonna live

304
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:01,039
a long, sad life,
knowing that he lost his
only chance at happiness.

305
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,914
Oh! What about
when he got beat up
by the goat?

306
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,213
(ALL LAUGHING)

307
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,254
So funny.
What a loser.

308
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Totally! I mean,
the guy's life was shattered
in a very public humiliation.

309
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:14,248
What a hoot!

310
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,957
And it may be years before
he can look certain family
members in the eye again.

311
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,531
He may be so
emotionally traumatized

312
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,359
he never fully
loves or trusts
anyone ever again.

313
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,455
That's hysterical.

314
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,067
Move over, Adolf Hitler.
There's a new king of comedy.

315
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,909
Ted, are you okay?

316
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,069
Yeah. I just think you
all might be interested
to learn something about

317
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:37,077
that movie
y'all love so much.

318
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:44,417
It sucks. And you're
all stupid for liking it.

319
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,419
Wow. That was really mean.
I think you owe us an apology.

320
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,360
No-can-do's-ville, babydoll.

321
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,373
No-can-do's-ville.

322
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,435
You said,
"No-can-do's-ville,
babydoll"?

323
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,275
You actually used
Jed Mosley's catchphrase?

324
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,381
I know. I was just
so upset that...

325
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,475
How do you know
that's his catchphrase?

326
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,946
You said it was
his catchphrase.

327
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,645
They dragged me to it.
I didn't wanna go.

328
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,646
I wanted to see
Avatar again.
All right, that's it.

329
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,218
I'm just gonna move to some
country where no one's seen
The Wedding Bride.

330
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,657
Good luck, Ted.
That movie is worldwide.
It's huge.

331
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,633
Maybe North Korea.
Nope.

332
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,371
I read that Kim Jong II
said it was his second
favorite movie of all time.

333
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,669
Right behind a movie of him
riding a horse in slow motion
through a field of turnips.

334
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,472
Sorry, Ted.
You're screwed.

335
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,674
No. You know what?
No, Ted is not screwed.

336
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,307
All right,
do you guys wanna know
why I'm nice to everyone?

337
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,013
It's because I don't
care about baggage.

338
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,316
I mean, most people,
they see another person
walking down the street

339
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,248
with that big heavy bag
they're carrying,
and they just walk on by.

340
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,524
But not me.
I look at them,
and I say...

341
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:57,393
I say, "Howdy, stranger.
Can I give you a hand
with that?"

342
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:01,234
And you know who
taught me to be that way?
A guy called Ted Mosby.

343
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:05,771
A guy who's
uncynical and sincere
and believed in things.

344
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,738
And you know what, Ted?
I believe that deep down,
you're still that guy.

345
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,671
I am still that guy.

346
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,505
I think you
wanna go out there
and get that girl.

347
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,011
I do wanna go out there
and get that girl.

348
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,683
Because she's
the love of your life!

349
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,450
Because she's...

350
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,279
Well, okay, let's...
We're three dates in.
She seems nice.

351
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,784
Because she seems nice!

352
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,245
She does seem nice!

353
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,585
You're right, Marshall.
I gotta go get her.

354
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,216
And I know exactly
where she is.

355
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:38,331
The wedding's
in 15 minutes.
I'll never make it.

356
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,525
You can do it, sensei.

357
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:45,237
Go give love
a roundhouse kick
right in the heart.

358
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,542
You're right.
What am I doing?

359
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,075
There's still time.

360
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,360
MINISTER:
Do you, Stella,
take Jed Mosley

361
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,457
to be your
lawfully-wedded husband?

362
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,830
STELLA: I...

363
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,137
(CLEARING THROAT)

364
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,170
Royce?
Stella?

365
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,365
Ted?
Tony!

366
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,707
Tony?
Ted?

367
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,841
Barney?

368
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,475
(SLURPING)

369
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,381
Something I need to say.

370
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,223
Look, there's
something I need to say.

371
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,148
A long time ago...
A long time ago,

372
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,123
I let a horrible
girl named Stella...

373
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,022
...I let this
beautiful girl
named Stella...

374
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,792
...break my heart.
...get away.

375
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,522
And now she's
with some jerk...
And now she's with this jerk

376
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,587
who wrote a movie
about it and...

377
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,585
...who doesn't
appreciate what he has

378
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:40,626
in this beautiful,
wedding bride.

379
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,760
...that movie is called
The Wedding Bride.

380
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,295
What are you saying?

381
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,201
JED: You can't
talk to me like that.

382
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,143
I'm Jed Mosley!
I'm Jed Mosley.
But, Royce...

383
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,299
TONY: This girl
in the white
wedding dress...

384
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,497
...this doofus in
the red cowboy boots,

385
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:52,838
this isn't me.
TONY: ...this isn't you.

386
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,342
So, just to be clear,

387
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,714
are you saying that
you don't have a pair

388
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,142
of red cowboy boots
in your closet?

389
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,877
Barney, what...

390
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,151
Well, I just wanted...
I mean, that's...
Everyone wants to know.

391
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,721
They're actually
more of a burgundy.

392
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,891
Royce...
Stella,

393
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,748
I promised to
make you my wife.

394
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,686
...I promised to
make you some pancakes.

395
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,561
And I'd like to live up
to that promise.

396
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,790
And I'd like to live up
to that promise.

397
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,855
STELLA: Tony, all I've
wanted all my life...

398
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,803
Ted, all I've
wanted all week...

399
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:20,468
STELLA:
...was your love.
...was some pancakes.

400
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,700
MINISTER: Go on, honey.
Kiss him.
Go on, honey. Kiss him.

401
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,435
GUESTS: Kiss him, kiss him...
Kiss him, kiss him...

402
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:25,871
OLDER TED:
Um, Uncle Barney
didn't say "kiss."

403
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:29,605
Kiss him! Kiss him!
Kiss him!

404
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,582
OLDER TED:
Still not saying "kiss."

405
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,251
Sir, you need
to leave, now!

406
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,921
This is outrageous!
Who the kiss are you?

407
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,789
Stella, if you still
truly love me...

408
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,418
Royce, if you still
kind of like me...

409
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,855
...can you
let me make you
my wedding bride?

410
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,592
...can you
let me make you
some pancakes?

411
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,473
Can-do's-ville, babydoll.
STELLA:
Can-do's-ville, babydoll.

412
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:57,903
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

413
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,610
JED: No! No! No!
Stop doing that!

414
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,212
Kiss this.
Kissing movie's
over, anyway.

415
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,405
Sir!

416
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,376
BARNEY: Oh. Oops, oops!

417
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,627
Hey,

418
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,263
that stuff that
happened to me,

419
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,326
it was pretty rough.
I'm still getting over it.

420
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,697
Let me help you with that.

421
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,905
OLDER TED: And just
like that, kids,

422
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,310
my baggage didn't seem
quite so heavy anymore.

423
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,814
You see, everyone's
got some baggage.
It's part of life.

424
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,346
But like anything else,

425
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,382
it's easier when
someone gives you
a hand with it.

426
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,857
Wow, it feels so good
to have told you
all that stuff about me.

427
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,533
I'm really glad
I can open up to you.

428
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,533
Ted, it's not
that big of a deal.

429
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,796
Heck, I've been
left at the altar.

430
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,665
Three times.

431
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,476
The last time was
because I blew all our
money on online poker.

432
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,908
That's why I live
with my brother now.

433
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,646
Wait, I thought
you said you had
a tiny studio apartment.

434
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,854
Yup, just the two of us.
You should see how
he hogs the covers.

435
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:21,547
(GROANS)

436
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:27,763
Yeah, you gotta go.
