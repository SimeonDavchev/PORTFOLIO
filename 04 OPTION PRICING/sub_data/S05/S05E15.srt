00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:03,199
OLDER TED: Kids,
I remember one time

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:05,941
we all gathered
at my apartment to
watch the Super Bowl.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,736
Well, not all of us.

4
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,838
TV ANNOUNCER: Welcome back
to Super Bowl XLIV in Miami.

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,181
Get a load of that guy.

6
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,217
You think that's
his real number?

7
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:17,917
Well, that explains
where Barney is.

8
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,345
Dibs on his wings.

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,096
Hey, guys.
Hi.

10
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,298
Does anyone know
who won the Super Bowl?

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,510
You were there.
It was the...

12
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,541
I won.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

13
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:43,907
Because I am now in possession
of a magic phone that
always rings.

14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,377
And do you know
who's always, usually,
on the other end? A chick.

15
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,648
So how many chicks
do I have calling
me now?

16
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,117
Infinity!

17
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,646
You guys
remember Ranjit.

18
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,161
Hello.

19
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:57,023
Hey, Ranjit.
Good to see you.

20
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,831
I've enlisted
Ranjit's services
as my personal driver

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,132
because for the next week,
I'll be sleeping with
hundreds of women,

22
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,525
and I don't
wanna take the subway,
'cause, you know, germs.

23
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,028
What, you're actually gonna
hook up with these girls
that call you?

24
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:10,101
Oh, indubitably. I'm meeting
the first one here any minute.

25
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,641
Keep your
eyes peeled
for a red sweater.

26
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,205
Based on her texts,
she's dirty,

27
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,935
dyslexic, and
wants to 96 me.

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,150
Semi-colon, end parentheses.

29
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,783
This ought to be good.
I can only imagine the
quality of girl that...

30
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:25,349
Oh, my God,
you are the guy
from the Super Bowl!

31
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,559
Magic phone, guys.
Magic phone.

32
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,759
Hey, guys.
Hey, Ranjit.

33
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:31,894
Hello.
Hey.

34
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,159
How's it goin'?
Hey.

35
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,727
That beer looks a little flat.

36
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,125
It's scotch.

37
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,497
Whoa! Something
troubling you, kiddo?

38
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,326
(SIGHS) Don.

39
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,801
OLDER TED:
Don was Aunt Robin's
co-host on her morning show.

40
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,541
Now, even though her show
was on so early that
no one watched,

41
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,777
Aunt Robin was
a consummate professional.

42
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,882
But Don was not.

43
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,553
Oh, yeah.

44
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,652
But that morning,
Don had gone too far.

45
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,854
Now that's
what I call having
a "woof" over your head.

46
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,745
Don?

47
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,157
Don?

48
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:04,992
Why is Ulee's Gold
in every crossword?

49
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,128
Oh, it's me?
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

50
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,125
Next Sunday is
Valentine's Day.

51
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,268
And one
lucky patient
will be receiving

52
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,973
a very special
chocolate heart,

53
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,374
a human heart.

54
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,807
Hey, that reminds me,
I have been meaning
to ask you.

55
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,611
Robin, do you have
any Valentine's Day plans?

56
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,209
He asked you out?

57
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,247
He asked me out.

58
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,812
That's crazy.

59
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,719
And they use "Ulee"
because of the vowels.

60
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,681
Ah. What did you say?

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,920
Well, we were on the air.
I was on the spot,
so I said okay.

62
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,046
(BOTH LAUGHING)

63
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,591
Robin, you are
gonna marry this guy

64
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,687
so freaking hard,
right in the butt.

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,730
What? No! I hate Don!

66
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,326
And now
I can't cancel
because I said

67
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,968
I would go out
with him on the air.

68
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,703
What would
your viewer think?

69
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,238
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

70
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,303
You said you'd
go out with him
on Valentine's?

71
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,241
I thought we had plans.

72
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:55,276
What? Getting
drunk and cleaning
the apartment was a plan?

73
00:02:55,343 --> 00:03:00,083
I did not say
it was a good plan.

74
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,817
Guys, guys, guys,
we're on me now.

75
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,322
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

76
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,024
And it is
getting interesting.

77
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,315
Look at these texts.
Read this one.

78
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:11,388
Yowza! Now look at this one.
Does she text her mother
with those fingers?

79
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,489
Now look at this one.

80
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,801
Or this one.
Or this one.
Or this one.

81
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,633
Okay, okay, okay, buddy.
How about you do this?

82
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,639
Go nail that girl,
then read your texts.

83
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:25,012
I can't do that, Ted.
I just can't hook up
with a girl

84
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:29,482
if there is
a hotter girl out there
with whom up can be hooked.

85
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,013
Isn't there
always a hotter girl?

86
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,919
I know.
Isn't it wonderful?

87
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,123
Go for Barney.
Cut to the chase,
what's your cup size?

88
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,285
Oh, hi, Mom.

89
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,355
There's always a hotter girl.
Isn't that the problem,
in a nutshell?

90
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:48,556
There's too many options.
You got Internet dating.
You got bars.

91
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,529
Holding up your phone number
on national TV.

92
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,869
I never had
that problem.

93
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:58,405
When I was 18,
I had an arranged marriage.

94
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:02,642
And I love my wife
more and more every day.

95
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,710
It is true.

96
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,448
It is very rare
that two people just
meet and fall madly in love.

97
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,445
Like Robin and Don.

98
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,347
But we're not even, like,
going out for dinner.

99
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,749
We're just
hanging out at his place.

100
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,220
LILY AND TED: Ooh!

101
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,989
No, it's not like that!
It's just us and
a bunch of other people.

102
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:23,699
Wait. Robin, what exactly did
Don say when he asked you out?

103
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,634
I'm having
some friends over to
my place for a little party.

104
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,769
You should come by
if you want.

105
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:31,035
I... Okay.

106
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,740
Robin, Don didn't
ask you out.

107
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,950
Of course
he asked me out.

108
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,281
No, he didn't.

109
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:40,047
Yes, he did.

110
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,782
He did. He did! He did!

111
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,221
Okay.

112
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,485
Well, dog my cats. I think
I know what's going on here.

113
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,586
Robin, did you want
Don to ask you out?

114
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,959
What? No! I hate Don!

115
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,229
I can't
stop thinking about
how much I hate him!

116
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,168
It's like...
It's like, all the time.
I just wanna attack him,

117
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,504
and rip his
stupid clothes off,

118
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:06,741
and just spank him
with his little paddle
until his bum's all red.

119
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,777
Shut up!

120
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,211
See? That right there
is what free will gets you.

121
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,981
Constant,
ego-shattering uncertainty.

122
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,050
I'm done with that.
I want what Ranjit has.

123
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,220
I've spent
my entire adult life
looking for the perfect woman,

124
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,930
and I'm spending
Valentine's Day
scrubbing the toilet.

125
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,663
I need someone else
to find me that woman.

126
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,830
Marshall, Lily,
"arranged marriage" me.

127
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,802
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,440
Or this one.
Or this one.
Or this one.

129
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,338
You want us to
arrange your marriage?

130
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:46,352
Absolutely.

131
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:49,324
Look, there's two
sides to dating, right?
Picking and getting picked.

132
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,693
Getting picked, I'm good at.
Ladies love Teddy West Side.

133
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:58,956
You're waiting for
me to comment on your
self-assigned nickname.

134
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,957
Well, here's my comment.

135
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,159
I love it!
Really?

136
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,530
Teddy West Side, continue.

137
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,099
It's the picking I suck at.
I pick the wrong girls.

138
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,238
But, you guys, you're
the best pickers I know.

139
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,073
You picked each other.

140
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,579
Well, with a slight assist
from the Wesleyan housing
department.

141
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:17,752
And a healthy splash
of Drakkar Noir.

142
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,681
Get out there.
Find me a girl.

143
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,617
We'll double date
on Valentine's Day.

144
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:25,092
If I like her,
I will marry her.
If she's cool with it.

145
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28,262
And she will be 'cause
I'll wear my nice blazer.

146
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,931
I love that blazer
almost as much as
Robin loves Don.

147
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,763
I do not love Don.

148
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,758
Robin,
neurologically speaking,

149
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,100
the part
of the human brain
that makes you hate people

150
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,396
is located right next
to the part of the brain

151
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,069
that makes you
wanna jump people's bones.

152
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,236
The two
responses are so similar
it's hard to tell them apart.

153
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,606
You know what it's like?

154
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,905
Wait, I have to get a book.
Give me 30 seconds.

155
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,384
Okay, this is fun.

156
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,046
Look at this picture.
It's a rabbit.

157
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:59,085
You can look at it for hours
and be absolutely sure
it's a rabbit.

158
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,252
But then one day,

159
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,820
you look at it,
and you realize,

160
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,889
"Wait a second, it's a duck."

161
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,029
It's a rabbit. It's a duck.
Rabbit. Duck. Rabbit. Duck.

162
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,196
Isn't this fun?

163
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,503
OLDER TED: It sure was.

164
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,966
Relationships are like that.

165
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,274
I mean, look, when
you first met Don,
you hated him.

166
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,466
You thought,
"This guy's a duck."

167
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,669
But one of these days,
you're gonna realize,

168
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,611
"This is actually something
that I love. He's a rabbit."

169

She's a gourmet cook.
