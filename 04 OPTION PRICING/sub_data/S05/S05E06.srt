OLDER TED:
In the fall of 2009,

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:05,166
a new couple had
moved in upstairs.

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,839
We hadn't met them yet,
but we could hear them
all the time.

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:10,278
They were always...

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,514
Well, kids, let's just say
they were always
playing the bagpipes.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,480
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

7
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,116
Okay, this is
ridiculous.

8
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,418
I can't believe those two
are still bagpiping.

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,330
I know.
It's been six hours.

10
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:28,263
Must be that
Tantric bagpiping
that Sting is into.

11
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,499
She keeps yelling out for him
to play the bagpipes harder,

12
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,734
but it sounds like
he's bagpiping her
pretty hard.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,400
There's a glass of water
in my bedroom

14
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,198
that's vibrating
like Jurassic Park.

15
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:41,376
You have neighbors!
Shut the bagpipes up!

00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,426
OLDER TED:
I decided to go to the bar
for some peace and quiet.

17
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,531
That didn't work out so well.

18
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:03,633
Ted, I hate
to have to be the one
to tell you this.

19
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,667
Marshall and Lily
are getting a divorce.

20
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,203
No, they're not.

21
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:10,138
Just listen to what
I witnessed yesterday.

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,672
Baby, you mind
washing that?

23
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,811
No problem.

24
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,345
I should go.

25
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,623
She makes him
wash his dishes
right away, Ted.

26
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,254
I give them two,
maybe three weeks, tops.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Barney,
that's not a big deal.

28
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:32,559
And it's certainly not
a big enough deal for you
to be holding my hands.

29
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,086
(VOICE TREMBLING)
They're in big trouble, Ted.

30
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:35,832
I see what's going on.

31
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,026
You, my friend,
are suffering from
a little-known condition,

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,469

I just made it up,

Robin and I have
been keeping a tally

40
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,316
of how many beds
we've done it in.

41
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,458
We're up to
83 and a half.

You want to talk
about yesterday?
Safe space.

Barney thinks Lily
asking you to wash
your dishes right away

50
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,637
is a sign
your marriage
is crumbling.

51
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,939
What? Why?

52
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,681
Lily likes a clean sink,
so I do the dishes right away,
what's the big deal?

53
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,477
I'll tell you
what the big deal is.

54
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,651
You know how
I was always the best
at being single?

55
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,291
BOTH: No.

56
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,956
Well, now I am the best
at relationships.

57
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,326

than you and Lily.

you think you can play
with the big boys,
adorable.

61
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,874
Son, I've been
in a relationship
since you had a ponytail

62
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,237
and were playing
Dave Matthews
on your mama's Casio.

63
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,276
I'm a good boyfriend
in my sleep.

64
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:56,582
I can rock a killer
foot rub with one hand

65
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,154
and brew a kick-ass
pot of chamomile
in the other

66
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,813
that would make
you weep.

67
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,651
Hell, I've forgotten
more about microwaving
fat-free popcorn

68
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,618
and watching
Sandra Bullock movies
than you'll ever know,

69
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,188
but thanks for
your concern, rook.

70
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:13,558
Marshall, let me
ask you one question.
Sure.

71
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,627
Do you mind
if there is a sink
full of dirty dishes?

72
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,604
Not really.

73
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,096
Then it's Lily's problem,
not yours.

74
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,698
Yeah, but if
I said that to her,

75
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,310
it would only lead
to a fight, so...

76
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:27,312
Oh! You fight. See,
Robin and I never fight.

77
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,675
(LAUGHING)
Of course you do.

78
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,682
No. And here's
the secret.

79
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:34,984
Every time it looks like
we're about to get
into a fight...

80
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,688
Why is there a bag of panties
labeled "April 2008"
in your closet?

81
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,403
So any time you think
you might have a fight,
you just get up and leave?

82
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,740
100% effective.
Can't fight if
you're not there.

83
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,207
That's what
Gandhi taught us.

84
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,375
Boy, that's not true.

85
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,654
I can't believe
that Robin puts up
with that.

86
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,723
Don't worry.
She's got a great way
to avoid fights, too.

87
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,922
Um, are ties
machine-washable?

88
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,585
No, they most certainly
are not. Why?

89
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,860
What is in your hand?

90
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,586
Oh, my God,
what is in your hand?

91
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,367
Okay, so you walk away,
Robin gets naked.

92
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:33,438
Those are the two
stupidest ways to handle
conflict I've ever heard.

93
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,637
Actually,
the naked thing
ain't bad.

94
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,177
That felt kind of weird.

95
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,175
Okay, call me crazy.
BOTH: Crazy.

96
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:43,847
But when a problem comes up,
Lily and I actually
talk about it.

97
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,617
There are so many
great things to do
with the human mouth.

98
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,716
Why waste it on talking?

99
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,988
But if you insist,
here's what I would say
about the dishes,

100
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,288
if I were Lily's husband.

going to wash that?

I'm glad you bring that up.
No. And here's why.

111
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,786
Lily, I know you
don't like a dirty sink,

112
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,294
but does that make it my job
to keep it clean?

113
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,987
I mean, if one day
I look up at
the living room ceiling

114
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,129
and think, "Hey,
I'd like a replica of the
Sistine Chapel up there."

115

Would it be your
job to paint it?

Well, no.
Of course not.

117

by the same logic,

if you don't like
looking at a sink
full of dishes,

shouldn't it be
your job to clean them?

something to them.

have our assignments
for the weekend.

to stand up
to your neighbors.

you're going to
stand up to Lily.

in sort of a crouched position

at our ski chalet.

00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,894
that probably would work.

183
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,316
Marshall, I'm just gonna
say this one more time.

184
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,531
It's a bad idea.

185
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:13,963
I think it could work.

186
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,957
Okay, two more times.
It's a bad idea.

some logical points.

188
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,928
Lily is
a reasonable woman.

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,900
I think that if
I explain it to her,

190
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,069
she'll get it
and I'll get my way.

191
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,537
No. She'll get mad,
and you'll get in
a huge fight.

have to wash dishes

is a surge. Fight harder.

wash another dish
as long as you live,

are always clean.

take all the anxiety
out of snacking.

are my manhood.
