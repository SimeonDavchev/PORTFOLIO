OLDER TED: Kids, up to
this point in the story,
we had found doppelgangers,

2
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:06,743
eerie but
awesome look-alikes,

3
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:09,214
for four of
the five members
of our little group.

4
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,243

Yes, mine was the coolest.

10
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:27,297
And so, we were all
eager to find the fifth
doppelganger, Barney's.

11
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:29,428
Turned out it was
more important to
some of us than others.

12
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,673
We agree there's no sense
in having a baby

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,139
until we've seen all five
doppelgangers, right?

14
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,068
Of course.
Stands to reason.

15
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:38,744
Okay, so, when we finally
see Barney's doppelganger,

16
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,712
that's the universe
telling us it's go time,

17
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,082
and that's when
we'll start trying. Deal?

18
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:46,182
Deal.

19
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:47,484
OLDER TED:
And then one day,
a few weeks later...

20
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,845
Baby, were you serious
about the whole fifth
doppelganger thing?

21
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,594
I mean, having a baby
is a pretty big thing to
leave up to the universe.

22
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:57,061
Yeah, I know it's crazy.
It's just so much easier
to let the universe decide.

23
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,092
Why do you ask?

ahead of you.

"Never-ending battle"?

170
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,711
Career's been trouncing
romance for years.

171
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:03,178
It's like the Globetrotters
versus the Generals.

172
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,286
Career's sinking
hook shots from
half court.

173
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,018
Romance is just
a bunch of slow,
white guys

174
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,694
who couldn't make it
in the Italian league.

175
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:14,193
Ted, I'm lost.
What should I do?

176
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,627
Okay, you seriously
need to talk to Don
about this.

177
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:20,195
I'm just too confused
to put this on Don.

178
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,573
I need to leave him
out of it until I
figure out what I want.

179
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,844
That makes sense.
Yeah.

180
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,743
And I'm sorry I can't
give you better advice
on this. The truth is,

181
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,136
it's impossible for me
to be objective about you
moving away.

182
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,781
Mmm.

183
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,016
Did you get
a manicure?

184
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,890
No, I didn't get a...

185
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,148
He sure did.

186
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,856
Flo!

187
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,819
Why are you brunette
and driving a cab?

188
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,087
Oh! That.

189
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,896
You know how it's
my dream to have sex
with at least one woman

190
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,028
from every country
on the planet?

191
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,132
Sure.

192
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,774
Wow. You're doing
surprisingly well
in the Baltics.

193
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,013
Mmm-hmm.

194
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,108
So I figured, what's the
quickest way to get around
the world in 180 lays?

195
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,851
Lease a cab and wait outside
the UN building for
hot foreign chicks.

196
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,078
BARNEY: It was
the perfect plan.

197
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,824
There was only one
small detail I didn't
take into account.

198
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,350
Chicks don't want
to bang cab drivers?

199
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,694
Chicks do not want
to bang cab drivers.

200
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:16,191
And I put a lot of
work into this one.

201
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,893
I can't believe this.

202
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,056
Now I gotta tell Lily
the fifth doppelganger
is a fake.

203
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,134
So, what does she care?

204
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,233
Lily decided that once
we spotted your doppelganger,

205
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,066
we'd start
trying to have kids.

206
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,871
Kids! No! Uh-uh!

207
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:35,744
The rule is, no kids
until you're at least 45.
Do you ever read my blog?

208
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,246
It's gotten a lot better.

209
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,248
I'm ready to be a dad,
you know?

210
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,821
But Lily needs some sign
from the universe.

211
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,945
And now
it could be years.

212
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,191
I'm sorry, buddy.

213
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,294
That'll be 37.50.

214
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,327
OLDER TED: So, that night,
Marshall went home to break
the bad news to Lily.

215
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:02,204
The universe has spoken.
Marshall Eriksen,
let's make a baby.

216
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,214
I...

217
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,775
Okay.

218
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,049
Hey.
Hey.

219
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,210
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

220
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:22,019
You... Hang on,
hang on, hang on.

221
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,015
I heard you were doing this,
so I wrote down some stuff.

222
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,027
"Hey, I'm planning
a white wedding.

223
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,429
"Tell me, Billy Idol,
is it a nice day for that?"

224
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,131
Some other
Billy Idol ones.

225
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,374
"If anyone's looking for
the real Slim Shady,
he's right here."

226
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,711
That one's only okay.
Robin, why aren't you
getting in on this?

227
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,768
Okay, first of all,
I'm getting tons
of compliments.

228
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,238
Second of all, tell him.

229
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,206
He's not getting
tons of compliments.

230
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,784
No, the other thing.

231
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:46,353
ROBIN: Oh.

232
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,118
I might move to
Chicago next week.

233
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,957
Hey, baby.
Mmm-hmm?

234
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,990
Not for nothing or nothing,
but we'd still be doing this

235
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,227
even if we hadn't seen
Doppelganger Barney, right?

236
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:06,872
Oh, but we did see him,
which means the universe,
in all its infinite wisdom,

237
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,800
is telling you to stick me
and stick me real good.

238
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,238
I can't. I can't,
in good conscience,
stick you.

239
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,714
(SIGHING)

240
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:17,484
I know what's
bothering you.

241
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,180
Really?

242
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,922
The cabbie just
didn't look enough
like Barney.

243
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,945
Well, that's
just not true.

244
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:30,457
No! Time out.
This is a group decision.

245
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,060
You can't just move
to Chicago, unless
we all say it's okay.

246
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,164
Barney, I think this
has to be Robin's...

247
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,296
Stay out of this, Brigitte
Nielsen or Dolph Lundgren
from Rocky IV.

248
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,072
We need Marshall and Lily.

249
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,901
That cabbie was, like,
a foot shorter than Barney.

250
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,906
He was the exact
same size.

251
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,338
And you know what?
I think he was Asian.

252
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,784
Yeah, that guy was like
a tiny, graying Asian man,

253
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,281
with a soul patch
and a potbelly.

254
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,312
Have you completely
forgotten what
Barney looks like?

255
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,377
You guys banging?

00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,116

in our bedroom?

(ROBIN AND BARNEY GIGGLE)

262
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,458
Hey! This is working.

263
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:14,196
Wait a minute.
Candles, flowers.

264
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,304
Oh! I guess Marshall
"forgot" to tell you.

265
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:21,437
The fifth doppelganger
was me.

266
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,544
What, wait,
and you knew about this?
You lied to me?

267
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,347
By omission.
And it's only because

268
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,419
this whole "leave it to
the universe" thing of
yours is insane, Lily.

269
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,149
Baby, you knew I needed
to decide if we...
Lily, we need to be

270
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,794
in control of
our own destinies.

271
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,420
Guys! Guys!
We're forgetting what's
really important here.

272
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,855

pulling this off.

Now, Robin has
something important
to tell you.

276
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:44,931
He's not
pulling it off.

277
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,265
No, the other thing.

278
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,299
He got a manicure.

279
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,504
The other thing.

280
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,410
I got a job offer
in Chicago.

00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,269
Whoa!

282
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,207
That's why we all
came down here,

283
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,383
to try and talk Robin
out of making a huge...

284
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,481
Actually, I've already
made a decision.

285
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,482
(SIGHS) Guys,
I gotta take it.

286
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,129
I can't believe
we're losing Robin.

287
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,603
LILY: Guys, this might be
the depression talking,

288
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,431
but is Ted's hair
starting to look
kind of good?

289
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,538
MARSHALL: Thank God.
I thought I was
the only one.

290

BARNEY: He looks like
a freaking movie star.

291
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,443
And by the way,
this was a huge mistake.

292

I'm changing
my hair back.

00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,008
Smart. Very smart.

294
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,345
Told you.
Not at all awesome.

295
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:37,221
Hey.
Hey.

296
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,050
So, I just got off
the phone with Chicago.

Yes, I have made
a decision. Um...

I appreciate the offer,
but I can't take the job.
Thanks.

Hey, Lily.
Tell me something.

302

You saw actual Barney
driving that cab,

303
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,375
and you thought it was
a petite, potbellied
Asian man.

304
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,088
I know. Weird, right?

305
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,590
It's not weird.

306
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:20,332
It means you're not ready.
And I'm sorry that I tried
to rush things.

the real Doppelganger Barney.

thin crust pizza,

gonna believe this.

What'd you say?

00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,597
I said yes.

319
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,506

for a shot like this.

you'd understand.

we know who has, like,
a really lame blog.

I hear it's getting better.
I mean, what is "blog"?

326
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,961
It's just
something that was cool,
like, eight years ago.

327
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,368
Still cool. Still sounds
pretty cool, man.

with the last name
"Doppelganger"?

to understand.

get out of here.

00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,649
Put yourself
in my shoes.

338
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,287
I mean, can you
imagine what it's like
to have the phone ring

339
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,693
and it's your dream job
on the other end?

340
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,331
Yes. I can.

341
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,296
Good luck in Chicago, Don.

342
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,173
Barney, why are you
doing this?

343
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,283
Wait a minute.

344
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:19,378
Could it be that
Barney Stinson actually
wants us to have kids?

345
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,182
Who is this Barney?
Take American chill pill.

346
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,621
Well, let me
tell you about him.

347
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,593
He talks
a big game about

348
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:33,231
how no one should
ever have kids before
they're at least 45.

349
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,300
I would be interested
in reading some of these
opinions in blog form.

350
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,100
But I think I know
what happened.

351
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,703
Yesterday, Barney thought
he had to say good-bye to
someone he truly loves.

352
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,036
And it got him thinking.

353
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,343
Maybe it wouldn't be
the worst thing

354
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,214
if a baby joined
our little group.

355
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,284
Babies can be cute.

356
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,084
Mmm.

357
00:16:56,116 --> 00:17:01,116
And someday, he's gonna make
the best uncle in the world.

358
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,794
Because this Barney,
he's family to us.

359
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,542
Excuse me.

360
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,110
I heard you're
from Estonia. So am I.

361
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,644
Excuse me one moment.

362
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,675
Estonia would
close out the Baltics!

363
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,679
And I am street performer,
like you.

364
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,269
(GASPING)

365
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,512
Hey.

366
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,611
(CRYING)
Say yes to this.

367
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,382
Okay.

368
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,810
Can I move back in?

369
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:04,346
Yes.

370
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:11,424
But, Ted, am I just
the biggest idiot
in the world?

371
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:16,358
Look, think about
all of us five years ago,
when we first met you.

372
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,526
TED: Marshall and Lily
were just boyfriend
and girlfriend.

373
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,465
Now they're married
and thinking about kids.

374
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:25,511
And Barney? Barney was
never gonna commit to
anyone, ever.

375
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:29,408
And last year,
he fell in love.

376
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:33,482
And me, I was chasing
some girl I was
convinced was the one.

377
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,384
Now she's one of
my closest friends.

378
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,617
And you?

379
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,562
Five years ago,
you never would've chosen
love over your career.

380
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,629
But today, you did.

381
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:46,828
Looks like I'm
getting dumber.

382
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,299
No, just more courageous.

383
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,803
Look, we've all been
searching for the five
doppelgangers, right?

384
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,244
Mmm-hmm.

385
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,910
But eventually, over time,
we all become our own
doppelgangers.

386
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,310
You know, these completely
different people who just
happen to look like us.

387
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,345
Five Years Ago Robin?
That girl, she was
pretty great.

388
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,620
But Doppelganger Robin?
She's amazing.

389
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,301
We've, um...

390
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,908
We've had
a lot to drink.
I don't care.

391
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:37,576
(LAUGHING)

392
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,380
What?

393
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:39,912
Oh!

394
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,682
I forgot. I'm blond.
I have blond hair.

395
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:45,947
You're blond.

396
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,985
OLDER TED:
And that's the story

397
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,860
of how dyeing my hair blond
kept us from doing something

398
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,930
we both would have
regretted that night.

399
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,529
Kids, the universe is funny.

400
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,867
Oh, my God.

401
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,506
Yes! You're here!
I don't understand...

402
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,841
This is fantastic!

403
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,007
Baby, simmer.
Your husband's right here.
At least attempt to hide it.

404
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,545
Guys, follow me.

405
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,720
Guys, look!
The fifth doppelganger!

406
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,387
Uh, Lily?

407
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,786
That dude looks...

408
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:31,357
MARSHALL:
Guys, go with it.

409
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,528
OLDER TED: Kids,
you can ask the universe
for signs all you want.

410
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,697
It's uncanny.
Right?

411
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,966
Looks just like Barney.
Amazing.

412
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,435
It's like looking
in the mirror.

413
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,944
OLDER TED:
But ultimately, we only
see what we wanna see,

414
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,676
when we're
ready to see it.

415
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,349
So, does this mean...

416
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,553
Marshall Eriksen,
put a baby in my belly.

417
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,816
(LIFESIZE PLAYING)

418
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:58,934
* All for love we become

419
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:03,058
* Larger than lifesize,
wondersome *

420
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,795
* Great in the eyes
of someone *
