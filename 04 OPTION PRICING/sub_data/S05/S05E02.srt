This is the story
of two blind dates.

One in 2009,

3
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:10,438
and one seven years earlier.

4
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,178
In all that time,
my dating routine

5
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,553
remained more
or less the same.

6
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,186
Until the fall of 2009,

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,021
when I finally had
a date that was different

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,994
because it was
exactly the same.

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,827
I was
on a blind date
with the same woman

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,562

with seven years earlier.

11

Yeah.

got four tickets

Why?

20
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:02,759
No, I said, "Guess who?"

21
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,526
I heard you.

22
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,425
Yeah, isn't it a little
early in our relationship

23
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,567
to do something that
would end our relationship?

24
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,302
What? No,

talking about?

Marshall, now that
Robin and I are together,

49

I've learned a lot
about relationships
by watching you and Lily.

50
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,331
Thanks, man.

51
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,166
You're a terrible couple.

52
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,702
Lily has taken all
the man out of you.

53
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,566
I used to think that's
just every relationship.

54
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,305
But what I've got
with Robin proves

55
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,180
that you can
have a girlfriend

56
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,809
and fully functioning
male genitalia all at
the same time.

57
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,475
Okay, right.
So, if Robin knew
that you were here,

58
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,875
she would be
completely fine with it?

59
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,617

She'd sprint down here

about other women.

It's harmless. Wait.

00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,597
The check came and,
of course,
I was going to pay,

174
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,233
but you didn't
do the check dance.

175
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,789
Guys want to wave the girl off
and, you know, look like
a big shot.

176
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:45,625
Huh.

177
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,559
I had no idea.

178
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,395
This is good.
We're learning stuff.

179
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,699
You know what we should do?
We should retrace the rest
of that night

180
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,643
and figure out what else
we do wrong on first dates.

181
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,409
'Cause let's be honest.
We are scaring people
off, Jen.

182
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,239
We really are.

183
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,014
Okay, I'm in.

184
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,013
Great.
Where'd we go next?

185
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,775
I think we went to MacLaren's.
Okay.

186
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:15,885
Hey, I didn't really talk
about my cats that much,
did I?

187
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,963
And then, there's
Tabby-Gail Adams,

188
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,931
the jester of the group.

189
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,769
Tone down the
kitty talk. Check.

00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,969
You will not believe
who we saw tonight.

191
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:32,142

We saw the third doppelganger!

Over the years,
we had spotted
two strangers

00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,006

like members of our group.

By the following summer,

203
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,962
we would find the
remaining two doppelgangers,

204
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,334
but I'll get to that.

205
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,872

206

Oh!

207
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,701
Okay.

208
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,765
Yeah, I couldn't
get her face in it,

209
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,674
but she looks
just like you.

210
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,306
So you went
to a strip club?

211
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,810
(CHUCKLING) Busted.

212
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,812
And there was a stripper
who looked exactly like me?

213
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,945
Okay, babe, look, before
you get mad, let me...

214
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,821
Awesome!
I bet the guys
were going crazy.

215
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,820
I bet they wanted
to touch her so bad,
but all you can do is look,

216
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:24,424
unless you
go into the back room, but,
honey, you gotta pay for that.

217
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,187
So, strip club.

218
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,697

Marshall made me go.

219
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,200
All right,
so what did I
do wrong next?

220
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,372
Let me have it.
I'm here to learn.

221
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,201
Well, I kept dropping
hints that I was cold,

222
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,107
but you didn't
offer me your jacket.

223
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,310
It's a little
brisk out tonight, huh?

224
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,012
Not really.

225
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:47,154
Really? I can't
feel my fingers.

226
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,180
I'm pretty impervious
to stuff like that.

227
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,147
I couldn't admit I was cold.
I didn't want to seem like
a wimp

stop talking about.

After a day of
fighting fires,

231
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,496
Jim would love to come home
and unwind working on his
'68 Camaro.

which he learned in the
Marine Corps.

I had an aunt in
the Coast Guard.

234

Okay, so no talking
about the ex.

235
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,013
Not even about his
shockingly small wiener?

236
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,883

lead off with that?

would get in there

and just go bananas.

241
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,933
See, Marshall?
We got to have a bros'
night at a strip club

242
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,830
and both of our ladies
are totally cool with it.

243
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,402
I'm not cool with it.

244
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,499
Because they understand
that it's healthy for us
to do that from time to time.

245
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,702
It's disgusting.

246
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,374
Because it's harmless.

247
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,372
Did one of your
whores tell you that?

248
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,714
And, Lil,
Marshall shouldn't have
to go to so much trouble

249
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,741

an innocent fantasy.

We're all friends here.

253
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,081
(LAUGHING) No, we're not.

254
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:03,316
Lily, sometimes I think
about other women.
Okay, it happens.

255
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:07,186
But even when I do,
I feel so guilty
that I...

256
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,227
I have to imagine
you passing away first

257
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,203
because even
in a fantasy world,
I could never cheat on you.

baby, and I love you.

fantasize about
other girls all you want,

maybe not murder me?

for your care!

in your name.

with your friends,
who I loved.

whether you're still
friends with them.

suddenly can't think of
anything I do wrong.

to call you, who always do.

342
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,215
Okay, when Stripper Lily
gets out here,

343
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,655
you have my permission
to fantasize about her.

344
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,190
And since she's basically me,
maybe you won't feel guilty.

345
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,557
Thanks, baby.
I'm so lucky to have you.

346
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,596
And stripper you.

347
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,729
Bring out Stripper Lily!

348
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,571
You know,
I don't come
here that much.

349
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,136
Hey, Barney.
Here's the usual

350
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,606
and I'll send over
the other usual as soon
as she's done stretching.

351
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,353
Thank you,
kindly stranger.

Ladies and gentlemen...

353
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,824
Oh! Hey, Barney.
I didn't see you come in.

354
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,162
I'll load up some
AC/DC for you, buddy.

355
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,359
Ladies and gentlemen,

356
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,531
please put your hands together
for (STAMMERING) Jasmine.

358
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,742
I am hot!
Yeah.

359
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:19,108
Crawl for it, stripper me.
This is awesome, baby.

360
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,069
Can I get another $100?
That was $100?

361
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,508
Wow, she crawls fast.

362
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,545
Look, Jen,
I wish I could go back

363
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,680
and talk
some sense into 2002 Ted,
but that guy's a lost cause.

364
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,721
He's 24.

365
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,863
He thinks a little
facial hair makes him
look like Johnny Depp.

366
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,729
And he has no idea what
a great girl he's
missing out on.

367
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,629
But I've
learned a lot since then.
I've learned a lot tonight.

368
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,733
The only thing that
we've learned is that

369
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,025
seven years ago,
it was a mistake
for us to go out.

370
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,167
And I guess
it was a mistake
for us to go out tonight.

371
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,343
No, it wasn't.

372
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:55,072
I had a great time tonight.
And seven years ago,

373
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:58,038
if you think about it,
we didn't miss by
that much.

374
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,347
I mean, if
a couple of things had
gone a little bit differently,

375
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,251
who knows what
would have happened?

Wow.

You are the best,
you are the best.

384
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:54,098
My girlfriend
is at a strip club with me
and she couldn't care less.

385
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,073
I do care, Barney.

386
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,472
Look, we're
dating now, okay?
That changes things.

387
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,705
We need to have
a serious talk
about this.

388
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,140
Just the best.

389
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,075
Hey, girlfriend trouble?

390
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,450
I wish I could help,
but my unbelievably
cool wife

391
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,009
just bought us
a private dance

392
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,177
with her
stripper body double.

393
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,146
So, if you need me,
I'll be getting grinded

394
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,224

in the champagne room.

395
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,315

Now what?

398
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,034
I just remembered
why I didn't call you.

399
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,825
Why?

400
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,497
(SIGHING) I can't believe
I'm gonna screw this up again.

401
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,109
But I like
finding typos in menus.

What?

403
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,975
And I know my shellfish
pun is stupid, but the
truth is,

404
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,381
I'm not
suddenly gonna stop
making stupid jokes.

405
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,424
Now that you mention it,

406
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,391
I'm never going
to stop talking
about my cats.

407
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,790
They're funny and
adorable and totally

408
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,722

take six Benadryl a day.

00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,997
Shouldn't we hold
out for the person

411
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,670
who doesn't
just tolerate
our little quirks,

412
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,299
but actually
kind of likes them?

413
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,069
Even if it means
finding ourselves

414
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,614
on another blind
date with each other
seven years from now?

415
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,380
Oh, dear God,
I hope that doesn't happen.

Well, good luck
out there, Jen.
