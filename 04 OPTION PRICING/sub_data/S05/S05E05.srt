Kids, as you know,
Aunt Robin grew up in Canada.

2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,812
That meant sometimes
she dressed
a little differently.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,440
Okay, let's do this!

4
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,348
Sometimes she talked
a little differently.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,050
Ted,
this hydro bill is bigger
than Louis Cyr's biceps.

6
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:17,494
What, you leave
the garburator
on all night, eh?

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,263
She hung out at
different bars

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,160
and enjoyed leisure time
a little differently.

Anyway, speaking of food,
Marshall, I've got
some bad news.

25
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:10,135
Just read online,
Gazzola's is closing.

26
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,371
No!
What's Gazzola's?

27
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,376
A filthy mecca
of spectacular
if undercooked pizza

28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,479
located at
316 Kinzie Street,
Chicago, Illinois.

29
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,182
Back in college,
Ted and I used to take
these crazy road trips

30
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,845
from Connecticut
all the way to Chicago
just for a Gazzola's pizza.

31
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:27,664
Twenty-two hours. No map.
We'd just jump in
the Fiero and drive.

32
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,618
We were like
Lewis and Clark,

33
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,627
if Lewis and Clark peed
in empty soda bottles

34
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,329
and had a bong
made out of
a cantaloupe.

35
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:38,572
Man, those Gazzola's trips,
that's when we really
became bros.

36
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,429
We ate nothing
but jerky.

37
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,268
Drank nothing
but Tantrum.

38
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,343
OLDER TED:
Ah, Tantrum.

39
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:47,212
Tantrum was a soft drink with
the highest caffeine content

40
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,481
legally available
over the counter.

41
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,610
It was eventually discontinued
after an extensive study
by the FDA.

42
00:01:57,185 --> 00:02:00,145
Oh, man, we went
through a whole case
of Tantrum one trip.

43
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,658
I was color-blind for
two weeks after that.

44
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,160
I think that's the reason
that I pass out
when I hear church bells.

45
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:08,404
It's probably a good thing
they're closing Gazzola's.

46
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,359
Those trips were
brutal, right?

47
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:13,768
The long hours in the car,
the motion sickness,
the smell...

48
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,271
So, what time are we leaving
for Gazzola's tomorrow?

49
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,373
I was thinking
9:00, 9:30.
Hmm.

50
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,321
I am ready
to hit the road.
I got baby wipes.

51
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:37,264
I got a variety of jerky.
I got six cans of Tantrum.

52
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,461
Well, four. One burned
through the can, the other
one I drank already.

53
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,763

seen you all week.

Did you watch
the Jets game?

61
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,375
We most certainly did.

62
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,651
How'd things go
at the doctor?

63
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,823
We no longer have
a hemorrhoid problem.

64
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,285
Hmm.

65

You guys will not
believe this.

66
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:13,228
I've been talking to
my lawyer all morning.

67
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,901
You know that guy I had
a slight disagreement with
at the Hoser Hut?

68
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,528
He's filing assault charges.

with a chair.

71
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,538
And now, apparently,
I might end up
getting deported.

72
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,470
Oh, my God, that sucks!
Yeah.

73
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,335

00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:31,376
Well, there's only
one possible way to
avoid getting deported.

76
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,712

I can become
an American citizen.

77
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,977
Perfect. Problem solved.
Welcome aboard.

78
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,616
Well, it's not that simple.
I'm a Canadian.
I was born there.

79
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,423
My family's there.
It's who I am.

80
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,956
I know,
and it's provided us
with a lot of laughs.

81

live here, work here,

82
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:51,365
and throw chairs
at people here,
you have to do this.

83
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,729
Well, there's a citizenship
test tomorrow.

84
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,767
(MUTTERING)
I'll think about it.

85
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:58,043
No, no,
you have to do it.
I'll help you study.

all night long.

and then we're gonna study.

We're gonna do
some cramming

89

gonna study.

be easy, this test.

citizenship test.

the Canadian test is easy?

loved chasing a ball,

and it didn't much
matter what kind.

golf ball,
basketball, beach ball,

00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,858
gum ball, a grapefruit,
which isn't actually a ball,

175
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,531
but it's round like a ball,

176
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,530
a football,
which isn't round,

177
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,262

technically a ball,

fun here, too, right?

Oh, I suppose I could arrange
a little recreation.

it leads to, who is this?

That, Barney,

Not only are you wrong,

but you are belligerently
sticking to your guns,

213
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,044
and insulting me
in the process.

Robin Scherbatsky,

215
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,735
you are an American.

we're not in college
anymore, okay?

We don't have to
drive all night.

they have a spa.

It's all Ted's fault!"

335
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,223
What exactly is
"Ted's fault"?

336
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,378
This! This whole thing!
We were having
a perfectly nice trip,

337
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,017
and then you kidnapped me.
You didn't even let me
put on underwear!

338
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,393
We never used to
put on underwear!

339
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,385
That was the fun
of a bros' trip
to Gazzola's!

340
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,627
We left everything
and everyone behind.
It was just you and me!

341
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,104
But now it's like
you've disappeared
into Lily.

342
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,074
That is not true.
It is true.

343
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,373
You're not upset because
you're worried she's mad.

344
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,005
You're upset
because you'd rather be
with her, eating muffins

345
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,640
than here with me,
eating this delicious...

346
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,535
I think one of my mushrooms
just crawled away.

347
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:49,016
You know what?
That mushroom's not the
only thing that's leaving.

348
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,022
Car keys, please.

349
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,058
(GRUNTS)

350
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,600
Look at this money!

351
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,366
This one has a moose,
this one has a beaver,

352
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,205
and they all have
Elton John on the back.

353
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,242
When I moved
to the States,

354
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,777
I swore to myself,
I wasn't going to change.

355
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,222
And yet, here I am,
in the most Canadian place
in the universe,

356
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,490
Tim Hortons,
around the corner from
the Hockey Hall of Fame,

357
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,659
and I don't belong.

358
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,158
It's like I don't
have a country.

359
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,534
Okay, that's it.

360
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,195
Attention, Canada!

361
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,267
I am Barney from America.

362
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,570
And I'm here to fix
your backward-ass country.

363
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,442
Number one.
Get real money.

364
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:49,142
Don't know what board game
this came from,
but it's a joke.

365
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:52,146
Number two,
and this is the biggie,

366
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,679
quit letting awesome chicks
like Robin Scherbatsky
get away

367
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,375
because, guess what?
You don't want her?

368
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,547
I'm planting my flag in her,

369
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,486
if you know what I mean,
which you probably don't,

370
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,461
and getting her
the hell out of here.

371
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,191
You may now return
to being pointless.

373
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,770
Oh, this coffee
is excellent.

374
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,237
Oh, hey, fellas.

375
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,044
It's called a tie.

376
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,424
ROGERS:
Sparky was my best friend,

377
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,556
but after I married Helen,

378
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:42,431
old Spark started to
feel a little left out.

379
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,102
For so long,
it had been just me and him,

380
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:49,272
but now he suddenly felt like
Helen had taken his place.

381
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:52,412
What Sparky
didn't realize was,
even though I loved Helen,

382
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,769
I still loved him, too.

383
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,777
I had room in my heart
for both of them.

384
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,580
But maybe I should
have put aside

385
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,522
some special ball-tossing time
just for the two of us

386
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,079
to make sure Sparky knew
that he was a good boy.

387
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,256
I wish now I had,

388
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,258
'cause old Sparky ran out
in front of a Cadillac

389
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,191
and got splattered
like a watermelon

390
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,426
in one of them
Gallagher shows.

391
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,362
I'm sorry, Ted!
I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry.

392
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,227
I never should have
been mad at you!

393
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,696
No, I never should
have brought Lily.
She pees all the time,

394
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,733
even at the apartment.

395
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,566
Still bros?

396
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,435
Best bros.

397
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,782
Hey, you want to
crank some Van Halen
just like old times?

398
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,810
Hells, yeah!

399
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:34,583
Or listen to
the Sparky book again?

400
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,854
Listen to
the Sparky book again.

401
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:36,652
Okay.
Let's listen to it again.

402
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:41,745
Man, those Canadian doctors
bandaged me up,

403
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,858
reset my jaw,
put my shoulder
back in its socket,

404
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,831
and they didn't even
bill me. Idiots.

405
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,532
All right, I guess
they're not idiots.

406
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,204
The coffee
was extraordinary.

407
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,612
I guess Canada's
not so bad.

408
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,408
They play their cards right,
maybe they can even
become a state someday.

409
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,452
Barney,
I've thought about this.

410
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,218
When you stood up
and told off those
people, I thought,

411
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,618
"Yeah, America's cool."

412
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,349
Hmm.

413
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,685
And then when those guys
pounded the stuffing
out of you,

414
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,460
I thought, "Yeah,
Canada's pretty cool, too."

415
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,230
In fact,
after you passed out,

416
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,659
I may have taken
a few pokes myself.

417
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,229
So, I've decided,
dual citizenship.

418
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,365
I'm going to be
American and Canadian.

419
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,740
Wait, you can do that?

420
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,538
Yeah, dummy.

421
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,670
Instead of being
a woman with no country,

422
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,505
I'm going to be
a woman with two.

423
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,981
I see.

424
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,878
You understand?

425
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,350
No, I can see out
of my left eye again.

426
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,558
Hey, baby? Baby?

427
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,491
Mmm-hmm? Yeah?

428
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,926
I'm so sorry
that we left you.

429
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,930
Did you go somewhere,
sweetie?

430
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,642
OLDER TED:
Yes, kids, it turns out

431
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,411
Crumpet Manor
had pampered Lily

432
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,939
into a nearly comatose state
of relaxation.

433
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,875
She didn't even notice
we were gone.

Oh, yeah...

439
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,526
So, I had
a great time, too.

440
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,329
That's good.
And I'm so sorry you
didn't get any pizza.

441
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,262
That's okay.

OLDER TED:
And if she
didn't mean it then,

443
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,499
she certainly meant it
19 minutes later.

446
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,665
It's like a hot ball
of lead!

447
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:42,944
Baby, cut it out of me.

448
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:44,936

449
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,017
That was a wild trip,
huh, Ted?

450
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,721
I know.
It was kind of crazy.

451
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,863
But how great is it
to drink some
Tantrum again?

452
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,918
You know who
had fun, was Lily.

453
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,587
Lily drank like,
four cans of the stuff.
Right, Lil?

454
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,431
Where's Lily?

455
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:06,373
Tantrum! I have to pee.
