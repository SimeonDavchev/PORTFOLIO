1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:03,202
OLDER TED: Kids, your
uncle Barney had been called

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:04,001
a lot of names
over the years.

3
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:04,712
Jerk!

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,769
Bastard!

5
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:09,506
Barack Obama, Jr.?

6
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,477
Mmm-hmm.

7
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,875
And, yes. We can.

8
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,747
But there's
one name none of us ever
expected to hear him called.

9
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,887
Boyfriend. Barney
Stinson is my boyfriend.

10
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,493
I've said it,
like, 100 times.

11
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,255
It still sounds
weird to say.

12
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:25,664
Well, anything
sounds weird if
you say it 100 times.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,300
Bowl.

14
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,532
Bowl.

15
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,371
Bowl.

16
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,743
But other than that,
things are good?
Bowl.

17
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,372
Bowl.
I don't know.

18
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:37,767
I think Barney's
been single for too long.
Bowl.

19
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,738
Like, the other night,
I wake up at 4:00 a.m...

20
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:40,807
(CLATTERING)

21
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,614
(GASPS)

22
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,776
Barney, are you awake?

23
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:46,646
Barney?

24
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,192
Barney. This is
not a one-night stand.

25
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,822
We're dating.
Come back to bed.

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,689
Bowl. Bowl.
That's happened three times.

27
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,261
And it's not just that,
it's other things.

28
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:06,432
Hey. What's wrong?

29
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,200
It was just one thing
after another at
work today,

30
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,510
and then I found out
my aunt's in the hospital.

31
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,073
I'm just...
I'm feeling so
overwhelmed and it's just...

32
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:15,712
(SHUSHING)

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,706
What you need to do
is talk through this stuff.

34
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,549
Thanks.

35
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,424
And then,
once you're off
the phone with Lily,

36
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:25,553
I'll be down in the bar
ready to have sex. Okay?

37
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,857
Bowl.

38
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,262
Look, I'm not
the touchy-feeliest
person in the world, but,

39
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,326
a little more
effort would be nice.

40
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,334
Bowl. Bowl.
I understand.

41
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,426
I guess,
in a lot of ways,
Barney doesn't stack up.

42
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:38,468
Bowl. Bowl.
I mean, you've had some

43
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,972
pretty incredible boyfriends.

44
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,913
Bowl. Bowl.
Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.

45
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,442
No, that's not it.

46
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,477
I don't know.
Bowl. Bowl.

47
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,452
Maybe he just
doesn't have it in him.
Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.

48
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,312
Maybe this whole
thing's a big mistake.
Bowl.

49
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,647
Bowl?

50
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:56,316
She really said that?

51
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,994
And she meant it.

52
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,521
Trust me.
I dated Robin for a year.

53
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,257
If you don't
want to lose her,

54
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,762
you gotta try
a little harder.

55
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,963
Be more attentive to
where she is emotionally.

56
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,455
You know,
just be present.

57
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:11,268
Yes, totally.
Yeah. Only thing,
and this is just me,

58
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,302
I like my testicles
attached to my body,

59
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,797
rather than rolling around
next to some eyeliner in
Robin's purse.

60
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,309
Stinson out!

61
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,412
OLDER TED: But then,
a funny thing happened.

62
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,944
Over the
next couple of weeks,
Barney was thoughtful,

63
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,280
considerate, sweet.

64
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,477
In short,
the perfect boyfriend,

65
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,519
which, to Robin,
meant only one thing.

66
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,224
He's cheating on me.
What?

67
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,516
Why else would
he buy me flowers?

68
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:34,717
He's getting
some on the side.

69
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,458
Come on, Robin.

70
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,734
Barney's not the type
of guy who would...
Go on.

71
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,892
Plus, he keeps
saying he's working late.

72
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,301
But when I call his office,
they say he left hours ago.

73
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,804
Well, that doesn't
prove anything.

74
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,495
Yes. Proof. Good word.
I'm glad you brought
that up.

75
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,469
Barney's briefcase.
He forgot it here
this morning.

76
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,669
And what do you
plan on doing with it?

77
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:57,811
We. We, you and I,
are going to open it
up and look for evidence.

78
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,848
Ted probably
has a sledgehammer
around here somewhere.

79
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:04,323
No! Stop! Stop!
Eye contact. Listen to me.

80
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,585
Robin Scherbatsky
is many things.

81
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,894
Friend, confidant,
occasional guest star
in some confusing dreams

82
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,757
that remind me a woman's
sexuality is a moving target.

83
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:18,326
But she is
no crazy, jealous
stalker-bitch. Let go.

84
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,799
Hey, I've been down in
the basement storage area
going through all the stuff

85
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,669
that Lily and I left behind
when we moved out.
I'm sorry, Robin.

86
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,608
We should've
cleared it out
for you much sooner.

87
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,413
There's a basement
storage area?

88
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:30,575
You're not upset. Good.
Baby, guess what I found.

89
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,921
That's great, honey.

90
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,646
What the hell is that?

91
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,491
Marshall got it in college.
He used it as a nightstand
for years.

92
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,628
Until we found out that
Lily was allergic to
barrel resin.

93
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,525
Barrel resin?
Just go with it.

94
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,197
So, you need a hand
throwing it out?

95
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:54,795
No, I'm not...
I'm not just going
to throw her out, okay?

96
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,798
Mabel's like family.

97
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,870
So, what are you
going to do with Mabel?

98
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,640
I want to
give her away to
a lucky new owner.

99
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,350
Do you know anyone?
Yeah, let me think.

100
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:08,053
Do I know any rodeo clowns?

101
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,515
That's weird, I do.

102
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,653
But even Lenny wouldn't go
near that mess.

103
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,789
Well, he's not
going to have
the chance

104
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:18,094
because I am
putting old Mabel
in the Bermuda Triangle.

105
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,358
OLDER TED:
"The Bermuda Triangle"
was the name we'd given

106
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,858
years earlier
to the curb right
in front of our building.

107
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:25,972
Whenever we wanted
to give something away,

108
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,473
we'd put it right there.

109
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,542
It was uncanny.

110
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,578
This is so exciting.

111
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,454
Right now,
there's someone
out there who has no idea

112
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,882
that tonight they're
going home with just...

113
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,919
Just the best barrel.

114
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,524
Well, let's just hope they're
not allergic to barrel resin
like Lily here.

115
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,517
Be cool, baby. Damn.

116
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,817
See you, sweetie. Good luck.

117
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,761
Bye, babe.

118
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,631
Now, can we please
get out of here?

119
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:55,895
Yeah. I'll grab my coat.

120
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,027
(GRUNTING)

121
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,898
Oops.

122
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,935
A college notebook?

123
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,014
Oh, my God,
he's cheating on me
with some college girl.

124
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,544
I knew there was a skank,
but I thought she'd
at least be dumb.

125
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,752
"Birthday, July 23.

126
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,484
"Favorite hockey team,
the Vancouver Canucks.

127
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,749
"Age 29, but tells
people that she's 26."

128
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,689
Oh, my God,
these are notes about me,

129
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,994
or some 29-year-old
version of me.

130
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:23,786
(DOOR OPENS)

131
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,558
I hope I'm not too late!

132
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,557
I want to
see the look of joy
on the new owner's face!

133
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,704
She's still there!

134
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,540
Okay, Mabel,
let's find you a new home.

135
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,537
Here comes a guy!

136
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:45,009
And he...
He just walked,
walked right on by it.

137
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,148
He's probably
rushing home to get
a handcart or something.

138
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,815
Yeah! Hey,
better hurry up, pal.

139
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,153
(LAUGHS)

140
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,789
What are you guys
doing with Barney's
secret Robin notebook?

141
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,534
Let me rephrase that.

142
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:03,503
Did you two ladies
lose some weight?

143
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,374
What do you know
about this, Marshall?

144
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,703
Why would
Barney have a notebook
full of information about me?

145
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,739
Well...

146
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,743
OLDER TED:
The truth was

147
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:15,935
Barney was taking a night
school class taught by me.

148
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,979
Welcome to Robin 101.

149
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:40,234
Why is
Ted teaching
a class about me?

150
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,900
It all started
a few weeks ago.

151
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,270
...rather than rolling around
next to some eyeliner in
Robin's purse.

152
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,838
Stinson out!

153
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,105
Stinson back in.

154
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:59,051
Say, hypothetically,
I did want to change who I am

155
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:03,419
to become a better
boyfriend to Robin,
which I do not,

156
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,931
what kind of changes
are we talking about?

157
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:09,203
Why... There's just so much
you need to know about her.

158
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,972
Okay, for starters, don't
ever cry in front of her.

159
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,974
Okay.

160
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:20,036
And whatever you do, don't
cry in front of her
four times.

161
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,438
Hey, guys.
What you talking about?

162
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,881
Fantasy football.
Fantasy football.

163
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,154
They realized they
couldn't talk about
this stuff at the bar,

164
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:32,316
and since you live with Ted,
they had to find
someplace safe.

165
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,885
So, Ted's classroom.

166
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,315
"How To Date
Robin Scherbatsky."

167
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,960
Lesson one.

168
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,986
Now, even though she
puts up a tough exterior,

169
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,831
what Robin really wants,
deep down...

170
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,426
I'm bored.

171
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,798
You said you wanted my help.

172
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,036
Can we draw boobs
on the chalkboard?

173
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,241
We did that already.

174
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,142
No, like, really big boobs.

175
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:55,184
No. Look, I need this, too.
I've only been a professor
a few weeks.

176
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,312
Being up here, it's...
It's good practice for me.

177
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,977
Can we have class outside?

178
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,306
No. What Robin really
wants, deep down is...

179
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,551
(CELL PHONE DINGS)

180
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,720
Barney.

181
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,245
What? I'm tweeting about you.

182
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,560
You should be flattered.

183
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,992
How do you spell
"blah-blah-blah"?
"H's" or no?

184
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:15,859
Wow, you were just, like,
the worst student in the
world, weren't you?

185
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:20,169
They said
I had A-D... Something.
Can we have class outside?

186
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,303
Barney, I'm only gonna
say this once, so listen up.

187
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:28,241
I love you and I love Robin.
And I want to make this work.

188
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,078
So, if you give me
a few weeks of attention,

189
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:35,254
I could give you
a lifetime of happiness.
Can you do that for me?

190
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,815
Do you think I should get
Sports Illustrated
for 70% off the cover price?

191
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,046
Can we have class outside?

192
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,121
I gotta
find a way to
reach this kid.

193
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,327
"Class number two."

194

"Top 10 Robin Scherbatsky
Facial Expressions and
Their Meaning."

195
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,903
Now, notice
the vacant eyes,

196
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,636
the pale,
queasy expression,
suggesting nausea.

197
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:58,043
What do these mean?
You guys just had sex?

198
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,035
(EXCLAIMING)

199
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,644
Wasn't me.

200
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,310
Dude! I worked really
hard on these slides, okay?

201
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,008
Can we just...
Okay.

202
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,548
This look is hunger.

203
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,587
If you ever see
Robin looking like this,
get some food in her quick,

204
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,893
or one of two things
will happen.

205
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:18,294
One. Weird,
out-of-context laughter.

206
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:22,898
Or two.
Spontaneously falling
asleep in strange places.

207
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:27,643
But the most important
facial expression of all?

208
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,913
That's a building.

209
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,512
Oh. That's for my class.

210
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,114
The Flatiron Building.
Fun story about it.

211
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,878
It was designed by Chicago's
Daniel Burnham in the
Beaux-Arts style.

212
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,048
This architectural gem...

213
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,115
Dude!

214
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,523
Right.

215
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,294
The most important
facial expression of all.

216
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,055
Whoa.

217
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,228
Flared nostril ridges.

218
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,097
Wide, unblinking eyes.

219
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,040
If you ever, ever see
this face, Barney, run.

220
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:10,976
And don't take
a picture of it.
She will punch you.

221
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:17,054
And you will cry for
the third time that night.

222
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,092
Which brings us to
an important point.

223
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,158
Defusing the bomb.

224
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,957
"Defusing the bomb"?
What does that even mean?

to Distract Robin
From Being Mad at You."

226
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,041
Distract me?
That is so condescending.

227
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,273
These guys are really
starting to piss me off!

228
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:42,108

231
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,353
What? That's not distracting.

232
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,120
That's just talking about
the story of a scrappy
little underdog team

233
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,389
that prevailed despite
very shaky goaltending

234
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,828
and, frankly,
the declining

My uncle had
a filthy, old shotgun,

238
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,772
blew both his thumbs off
trying to shoot a beaver.

239
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,411
You... You want
to distract someone,

240
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,175
make them watch my uncle
try to eat corn on the cob.

241
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:22,276
(READING)

242
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,147
Did you know that
before intercourse,

243
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,959
the male and female emperor
penguins bow to each other?

244
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,233
"Mr. Penguin."
"Mrs. Penguin."

245
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,163
Oh, God,
silly penguins,
acting all fancy.

246
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,369
(LAUGHING)

247
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,071
What were
we talking about?

248
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,173
Uh-oh,
looks like we got a taker.

249
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,106
Come on, dude.
You know you want to.

250
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,843
A guy like you,
beard, no mustache.

251
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,479
You're exactly
the kind of guy who
could use a sweet barrel.

252
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,209
Do it.

253
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,922
No. That's not
a fire hydrant!

254
00:11:56,984 --> 00:12:00,224
For shame, sir. For shame!

255
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,757
I bet
you couldn't even grow
a mustache if you wanted to!

256
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,334
Neither can you, sweetie.

257
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,302
Well, he doesn't
know that, baby! God!

258
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,361
Ted's only
teaching Barney
horrible things about me.

259
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:16,741
I don't know. Check this out.
This is actually kind
of sweet.

260
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:20,044
Now, we all know Robin's
not what you'd call
"touchy-feely."

261
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,907
She doesn't
say, "I love you,"
like a normal person.

262
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,806
Instead, she'll laugh,
shake her head,

263
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,479
give you a little smile
and say, "You're an idiot."

264
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,620
"You're an idiot"?
Yup.

265
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,915
If she tells
you you're an idiot,
you are a lucky man.

266
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,929
And if she does say,
"I love you,"

267
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,391
she's already broken up
with you in her mind.

268
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,061
I think it's nice that
Ted knows you that well.

269
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,530
Yeah, well, too bad it's
next to a page entitled...

270
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,368
"Robin Scherbatsky's
Surprising Erogenous Zones."

00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,977
Left knee.

273
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,413
Does lefty like that?

274
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,277
(MOANING)

275
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:04,116
Oh, yeah.
Lefty like that.

276
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:08,324
I can't believe I'm taking
sexual advice from Ted Mosby.

277
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,158
That's like taking
fashion advice from...

278
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,394
Well, Ted Mosby.

279
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,504

Guess who?

289
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:42,094
never show Robin a YouTube
clip of an animal playing
a musical instrument.

290
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,592
Barney!

291
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,292
Do you
have a problem
with this class?

292
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,730
Yeah, it's boring as hell
and I'm not learning anything.

293
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,727
Well, maybe the problem
is your attitude.

294
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,699
You're not listening
to a word I say.

295
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,736
Uh-huh.

296
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:59,742
Can you hear this, Professor?
Or should I turn it up
for you?

297
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:03,576
OLDER TED:
It may not
have been a thumbs-up, kids.

298
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,613
So, you think you're
not learning anything, huh?

299
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,217
Okay. Pop quiz.

300
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,952
What...

301
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,348
When Robin's PMS-ing,
what kind of chocolate
should you get her?

302
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,590
Trick question.
Get her butterscotch.

303
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:15,724
Correct! Why?

304
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,088
Butterscotch is
to Canadian women

305
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,357
what chocolate is
to American women.

306
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:21,625
Correct! What is
Robin's dream job?

307
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,934
To become the most successful
female TV journalist of
all time.

308
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,597
Correct!
And if she achieves that,
will she truly be happy?

309
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,396
No! Robin's
deep-seated need for
attention can be traced back

310
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,069
to her father's
emotional distance,

311
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,508
and no amount of success
will ever make up for
what she truly needs,

312
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:37,313
which is six
simple words from her dad,
"Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?"

313
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,107
Yes!

316
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,123
You haven't
learned anything.

317
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,523
Sorry to have
wasted your time.

I know, right?
The end? Tears.

321
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,768
Okay, can I just say
that my deepest need
in life

322
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,540
is not
to have my father say,
"I am proud of you, eh?"

323
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,840
Then why are you
crying right now?

324
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,081
I'm not crying.

325
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,316
Sweetie. Can I get
you some butterscotch?

326
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,823
No, stop it.

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,259

It says
here that the class
meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.

330
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,359
So?
That's right now.

331
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,099
Now, as you can see,
well over 50% of
the blankets

332
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,936
have been dragged onto
her side. Make no mistake.

333

337
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,180

Flared nostril ridges.
Wide, unblinking eyes.

340
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,564
Uh-oh.

341
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,869
I got this. So,
emperor penguins.

342
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,232
Crazy, huh?

343
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,769
What the hell do you
two think you're doing?

344
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,668
Marshall, did you sell us out?

345
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,680
I was vulnerable, okay.

346
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,612
I said good bye to
a very dear friend today.

347
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,808
Dude, it's a barrel!

348
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,550
Aw. You're giving Mabel away?

349
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,645
Okay, I have...
I have so many questions.

350
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,647
Why would you do this?
What were you thinking?

351
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,460
Who the hell is that guy?

352
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,363
That's Shin-Ya.
He's sort of been
auditing the class.

353
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,626
Auditing?

354
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,704
Well, I tried to explain
to him it wasn't a real class,

355
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,773
but I don't think
he speaks much English.

356
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,601
On the bright side, he came
in handy standing in for you

357
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,638
during the role-playing
exercises.

358
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:47,513
Wait. You did role-playing
exercises where I was
played by Shin-Ya?

359
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,344
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

360
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,352
You know,
I can't believe you, Ted.

361
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,424
You actually think you're
some kind of an expert on me?

362
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,223
Hey! He is an expert.
He's a great teacher!

363
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,786
(CLEARING THROAT) Kiss ass.

364
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,893
You know, half the stuff
in this notebook is
patently wrong.

365
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,325
Really? Name one wrong thing.

366
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,662
"Robin Scherbatsky's
Surprising Erogenous Zones."

367
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,697
Let me clear
something up
for you, Ted.

368
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,803
Does lefty like that?

369
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,725
Oh, yeah.

370
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,371
All right.

371
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,836
Don't want to
leave out righty.

372
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,544
Oh, no.

373
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:23,476
The right one's ticklish,
I guess.

374
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,653
But the left one, yeah,
I'm glad you're back there.

375
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:31,683
Because that is just
some sweet, sweet loving.

376
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,991
Noted.

377
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,793
That was a lie?
We had just started dating.

378
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:36,815
I was being nice.

379
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,989
(CHUCKLING)

380
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,857
And you. You know,

381
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,426
I got it
into my head this week
that you were cheating on me.

382
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,955
I even broke
open your briefcase
to look for evidence.

383
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,831
That is a huge
violation of my privacy!

384
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,311
Go on.

385
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,013
You know, in a way,
I was right. You cheated.

386
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,375
You can't get some crib sheet
on dating me. That's not how
it works.

387
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:03,746
If we can't figure out how to
be with each other in a real,
honest way,

388
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,616
I don't see the point of
even trying.

389
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,728
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

390
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,799
What do you want?

391
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,238
Look.

392
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,373
All that stuff I told Barney,

393
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,368
it was personal
between you and me.

394
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,541
I'm really sorry.

395
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,710
I guess I'm impressed
by how much you remembered.

396
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,624
It's funny.

397
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,523
When you date someone,
it's like you're
taking one long course

398
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,616
in who that person is
and then when you break up,

399
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,888
all that stuff
becomes useless.

400
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,986
It's the
emotional equivalent
of an English degree.

401
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,800
I guess I just liked
the idea of putting
all my

402
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,102
Robin Scherbatsky knowledge
to good use, you know?

403
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:57,436
Well, since you
know me pretty well,

404
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,944
am I fooling myself
with this whole
Barney thing?

405
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,606
I don't know.

406
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,179
I will say this, though.

407
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,584
I've seen Barney work
very hard to get women.

408
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,917
I've seen him
work very hard
to get rid of women.

409
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,493
I've never seen
him work this hard
to keep one around.

410
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,994
I was going
to give him an A.

411
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:20,226
Well, B+.
Shin-Ya kind of
screwed up the curve.

412
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,434
Hey. Before
you say anything,

413
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,999
I am done with this
stupid Robin 101, okay?

414
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,868
Here, I'll get rid
of the notebook.

415
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,579
But there's...

416
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,875
There's something that
I did want to say to you.

417
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,648
Robin, I have been
with a lot of women.

418
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,861
Blondes, brunettes, redheads.

419
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:53,661
Big boobs,
small boobs,
medium boobs,

420
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,956
some boobs that were big,
but kind of in a bad way.

421
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,799
The point is...
Boobs that pointed in
opposite... The point is...

422
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,943
I'm really scared
that you're going
to dump me

423
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,805
and that's why
I did this and
I'm sorry.

424
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,284
You're an idiot.

425
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,694
You know...
Hmm?

426
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:27,126
That notebook does
contain a lot of
personal info,

427
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,003
and I think it
has my home address.

428
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,831
And your work address.

429
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,802
Whoa.

430
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,997
MARSHALL: Hey, guys!

431
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,798
If you
don't want the barrel,
can you sit somewhere else?

432
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,010
'Cause you're scaring away
potential takers.

433
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,549
Designed by Chicago's
Daniel Burnham in the
Beaux-Arts style,

434
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,687
this architectural gem
was the first of its kind...

435
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,793
Professor Mosby?
Yes, Susan?

436
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,715
That's a woman drinking beer
on the toilet.

437
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,759
Right. That... That
was Daniel Burnham's wife.

438
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,900
She was
a troubled, troubled
woman. We are moving on.
