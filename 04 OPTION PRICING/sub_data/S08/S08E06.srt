00:00:00,835 --> 00:00:02,703
<i>In the fall of 2012,</i>

2
00:00:02,793 --> 00:00:04,576
<i>Nick and Robin</i>
<i>were going strong.</i>

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,104
<i>Sometimes it's hard to say</i>
<i>what it is exactly</i>

4
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:08,372
<i>that makes a couple click.</i>

5
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:10,758
Wow.

6
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:14,011
<i>Bravissimo!</i>

7
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:17,047
<i>Whatever it was, kids,</i>
<i>Nick and Robin</i>

8
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:18,882
<i>really connected at first.</i>

9
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:21,051
Hey, you know,
I think I'm really starting

10
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,269
to feel something here...

11
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:27,224
<i>But then, as often happens,</i>
<i>they started to drift apart.</i>

12
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:28,692
<i>Why?</i>

13
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:30,027
<i>Who can say?</i>

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,563
Nick and I haven't
had sex in three days.

15
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,064
And it's your fault.

16
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:35,032
Nick won't have sex

17
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,600
because he pulled
his groin muscle,

18
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,619
all 'cause you made him join
your stupid basketball team.

19
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,071
Did you say
"stupid basketball team"?

20
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:41,938
Yeah.

21
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,990
Oh, my gosh, guys,

22
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:45,042
we have to rush Robin
to the hospital.

23
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,544
Because somehow, she swallowed
her vocal cords

24
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,463
and they got lodged
in her rectum,

25
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,131
because she's
talking out of her ass.

26
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,750
<i>Over the summer,</i>
<i>Marshall had joined</i>

27
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,719
<i>a midtown professionals</i>
<i>basketball league.</i>

28
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:59,256
<i>His team of lawyers was called</i>
<i>The Force Majeurs.</i>

29
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:01,625
<i>Ever since they lost</i>
<i>to a group of accountants,</i>

30
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,594
<i>he'd started getting</i>
<i>a little intense about it.</i>

31
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,296
You sure you didn't have
a ringer or two out there, Joel?

32
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:07,764
Don't know
what you're talking about.

33
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:10,100
Good hustle out there,
Aboubakar!

34
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:15,989
If Joel can use ringers,
then so can we.

35
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,441
And Nick is our best player.

36
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:18,808
So as far as I'm concerned,

37
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,694
you can both
keep your groins on ice.

38
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:21,645
Groins on Ice.

39
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,080
Least popular

40
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,449
Madison Square Garden
holiday show ever.

41
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,117
Why are you so into
this basketball league?

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,653
Robin, it's the Little Ivies
Professionals Over 30

43
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:31,371
Who Work In Midtown League.

44
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,706
It's The Show!

45
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,509
You know, it's kind of funny,

46
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:38,495
imagining people
icing their groins.

47
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:40,380
I mean, first they'd be
all cold,

48
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:43,050
and then the ice
would start to melt,

49
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:47,788
and things would get
all wet and... steamy.

50
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:52,192
Okay, Lily.

51
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:53,810
Look, buddy,

52
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:55,195
I'm also the captain of a team

53
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:56,846
in the Little Ivies
Professionals Over 30

54
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,365
Who Work In Midtown League.

55
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,234
I'm addicted
to the adrenaline, too.

56
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:01,201
Still, don't you
think you're getting

57
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:02,569
a little obsessive about...

58
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:04,020
Uh, hold up, hold up.

59
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:06,156
Are you suggesting
that you are

60
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:10,494
a member of a sports team
<i>and</i> you're the captain?

61
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:11,795
So says the "C"

62
00:02:11,797 --> 00:02:14,381
I personally sewed
onto my jersey.

63
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:16,366
After Victoria
and I broke up,

64
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:18,302
I had some free time.

65
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,170
So, called up
a few architect friends

66
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,338
and put together
a little team

67
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,725
called the T-Squares.

68
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,228
See that?

69
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,646
The floor's uneven.

70
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:32,482
And that window placement
is rubbish.

71
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:34,651
You know, if a genie
gave me one wish,

72
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:37,387
I would knock down that wall
and create a nice flow.

73
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,189
Great wish.

74
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,909
I mean, there's too
much hardwood, right?

75
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,945
Did you nerds actually
play any basketball?

76
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:49,700
Um, us nerds focused on
something far more important:

77
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,001
bonding.

78
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,619
You guys are
going to get pounded.

79
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,538
And I am not.

80
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,090
Oh, come on. You can't go
a couple weeks without sex?

81
00:02:57,092 --> 00:03:00,260
Our point guard's a 52-year-old
virgin, happy as a clam.

82
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:02,212
I'm sure he's quite
a ball handler.

83
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:04,715
The problem is,
now that we're not having sex,

84
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,933
we're talking more,

85
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:10,587
and I'm realizing
that Nick is kind of...

86
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:11,921
dumb.

87
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:13,557
Really?
News to me.

88
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,608
I hadn't noticed that.
No.

89
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,692
Oh, my God.

90
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:17,527
You guys think
that he's dumb, too?

91
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:18,478
So dumb.

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,479
Air bags are sharper.

93
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,765
Hot as lava
but just as thick.

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,166
Wow. When did you guys start to
notice that he was kind of dumb?

97
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:43,286
Well, there was that time
Nick was doing the crossword.

98
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:45,806
Hey, what's a four-
letter word for cut?

99
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,923
"Nick."

100
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:48,592
Yeah?

101
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,010
Is a four-letter
word for cut.

102
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:50,894
What is?

103
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,596
"Nick."
What?

104
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:54,898
Oh. I got it.

105
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,734
"Shave."

106
00:03:57,736 --> 00:04:01,238
And there was the comment
about Gypsies.

107
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,272
No, no.

108
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,807
I think Gypsies prefer

109
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:05,475
to be called Romani now.

110
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:08,195
Do they? Really?

111
00:04:08,197 --> 00:04:11,198
And what do unicorns
and, uh, elves

112
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,783
and leprechauns
prefer to be called?

113
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:17,037
You do know, uh,
Gypsies are

114
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:19,673
a real ethnic group
that actually exists?

115
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:23,210
Oh, you guys, I
feel terrible now.

116
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:25,045
I always thought they
were just made up,

117
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,464
like goblins or
trolls or dolphins.

118
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:31,635
And then there's that story
you told about how you and Nick

119
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,437
picked up
that Danish exchange student

120
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,472
and you all
took a shower together.

121
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:38,141
I never told a story like that.

122
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:39,693
Well, no time like the present.

123
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:40,677
Let's give this

124
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,862
Danish ho a name.

125
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,313
I'm thinking Nadia.

126
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:46,983
Yeah, she sounds slutty
and bi-curious.

127
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,869
What is wrong with you?

128
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:50,320
Your kid is right there.

129
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:51,805
Maybe want to
clean it up a lit...

130
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:55,292
You're wearing a baby
and you're doing pull-ups?

131
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:58,378
No, Ted, I'm sitting around
getting soft,

132
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,497
'cause that's what champions do.

133
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:04,551
The problem is, now that
I know how dumb Nick is,

134
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:06,870
it's kind of making me
reconsider the relationship.

135
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:07,971
Why?

136
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:10,223
Eventually,
Nick's groin will heal

137
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,708
and you'll be back in Sexville,

138
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,878
where all the crossword puzzles
only have one box to fill.

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,713
Talk about
a double standard.

140
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:20,400
Every time I go after a busty
dullard who can't tell time

141
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:23,820
or thinks I'm the ghost of
Leonardo DiCaprio, I'm shallow.

142
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:26,156
But somehow it's okay
for Robin to date a guy

143
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:28,224
who can't be trusted
around outlets.

144
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,526
Dump him!

145
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,828
Okay, that is ridiculous.

146
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,564
Is Nick a genius? No.

147
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:35,532
But does he have

148
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:37,567
average intelligence?

149
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:38,618
No.

150
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,903
But he is

151
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:41,671
a human being, with a heart!

152
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:45,125
And you're afraid if I dump
him, it'll throw off his game.

153
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:47,294
Robin, he got 36 points
and 17 rebounds last week.

154
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,596
And that was with his shoes
on the wrong feet.

155
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:54,851
Well, you're probably
all wondering

156
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,937
how the T-Squares' practice
went today.

157
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,271
The T-What?

158
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:00,423
We played up here.

159
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:03,110
Basketball,
people don't realize,

160
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,428
is all geometry,
physics and engineering.

161
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,614
If you think
like an architect,

162
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:11,151
you could win a thousand games
without ever touching a ball.

163
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:13,954
What happened
to your ball?

164
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,622
Some kids from the Hebrew school
next door took it

165
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:16,540
and wouldn't give it back.

166
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,273
Oh.

167
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:18,241
Oy.

168
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:19,459
Hey.

169
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,944
Hey.
Hey. Oh, thanks.

170
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:22,879
How'd the breakup
with Nick go?

171
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,498
Well...

172
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,416
So, I went to this
fortune teller today

173
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,635
and she said there was
a curse on me.

174
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:31,555
Did she sell you something
to ward off the curse?

175
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,257
It's like you're
a fortune teller, too.

176
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,145
Nick, um...

177
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,596
I think we need to talk.

178
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:40,630
Yeah.

179
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,799
Uh... it's just...

180
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:45,635
Whoa, these are hard.

181
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,604
Anyway, this $500 bracelet
will ward off evil

182
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:49,239
till the end
of the week, so...

183
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,807
Do you think that
you could do,

184
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,976
uh, sit-ups or something
while you talk?

185
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:54,244
Yeah.

186
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,247
Anyway, this fortune teller,

187
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:00,200
she was able to tell me all
sorts of stuff about my future,

188
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:05,956
just from my credit cards
and my social security number,

189
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,307
I knew you'd cave.

190
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:08,625
Which is why I came up with

191
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:10,260
a little extra
incentive

192
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,545
to break up with Nick.

193
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:14,764
End it by 8:00 p.m. tonight
or this invite goes live.

194
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:18,602
"Robin and Patrice's

195
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,770
BFF Fun Day?!"

196
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:23,356
<i>Kids, Patrice was</i>
<i>a coworker of Robin's</i>

197
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:26,276
<i>who'd become sort of</i>
<i>obsessed with her.</i>

198
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,195
<i>Robin had managed, until now,</i>

199
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:32,015
<i>to keep Patrice</i>
<i>at arms length.</i>

200
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:34,284
<i>But if Patrice were invited</i>
<i>to something called</i>

201
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:37,020
<i>Robin and Patrice's</i>
<i>BFF Fun Day,</i>

202
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:39,306
<i>she'd latch onto Robin</i>
<i>and never let go.</i>

203
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:41,208
Why would
you do that?

204
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,459
Delete that right now!

205
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,544
No! If I don't give you
a little push,

206
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:47,196
you'll let this drag on
until Nick can have sex again,

207
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:50,500
and then you'll be right back
to procrastinating on all fours.

208
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:53,253
I hate to admit it, but the
man in the suit has a point.

209
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,971
Ugh!

210
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,206
Fine, but the playoffs
are coming up soon,

211
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,643
and I can't have this
guy an emotional wreck.

212
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,479
If you do dump him, at
least let him down easy.

213
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,547
Yeah, take him
to a nice restaurant.

214
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:05,815
Preferably a dessert place.

215
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:07,851
That way, you won't have to
sit through a whole meal

216
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:08,768
before you get to...

217
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,219
Splitsville.
Exactly.

218
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:11,438
No, Splitsville.

219
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,772
It's a dessert place
right around the corner.

220
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:16,076
<i>It's sort of</i> the <i>place</i>
<i>to end a relationship.</i>

221
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:22,782
Uh, Nick, listen.

222
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,735
You are awesome

223
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:30,457
and totally sweet,
but we're just not...

224
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:33,877
You know where I'm going
with this, right?

225
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,412
No. No clue.

226
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:39,916
Okay, um...

227
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,802
I don't know if we should
keep seeing each other.

228
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:45,505
You want to start turning
off the lights during sex?

229
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:47,090
No. God, no.

230
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:48,942
No! No.

231
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:53,613
I am just worried that, as
a couple, we're not working out.

232
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:56,099
You want to start
going to the gym together?

233
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:57,767
Okay, no, Nick,
here is the deal.

234
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,735
Okay...

235
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:01,237
Sorry, babe. I got to take this.

236
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,305
Excuse me.

237
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,624
Hello.

238
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,076
Hey, what's up?

239
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:10,130
You...

240
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,798
What? I...

241
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,966
I don't understand.

242
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:15,118
But you...

243
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,419
Okay, um, you know what?

244
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,588
I'm sorry, I-I have to go.

245
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,092
What happened?

246
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,178
I...

247
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,296
I, um...

248
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:30,066
Uh, I'm sorry,
I can't talk about this.

249
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:34,604
Anyway,

250
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:37,607
what were you going to say?

251
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,410
Uh...

252
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:45,031
I was gonna say,
order whatever else you want.

253
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:46,533
It's on me.

254
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:48,752
Well, thanks,
but I think I'd just rather

255
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,653
eat it out of a bowl.

256
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:55,898
Well, no doubt
you're all wondering

257
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:57,479
how the T-Square's
first game went.

258
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,531
What Squares?

259
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,116
Picture a well-
oiled machine.

260
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:01,917
Your sewing machine?

261
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,953
There were two seconds
left on the clock.

262
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:06,956
<i>Aboubakar was all over me.</i>

263
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,508
<i>And that's when all my years</i>
<i>of architectural training</i>

264
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,177
<i>came to my aid.</i>

265
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,847
<i>I saw the space in a way</i>
<i>my opponents never would.</i>

266
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:31,397
Yes!

267
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,183
I told you guys
I'd make one of these!

268
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:36,118
Turns out, those two
points were taken away

269
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,520
because apparently the
ball went "out of bounds."

270
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:39,572
But don't worry,

271
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:42,024
I'm appealing
to the league office.

272
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:45,311
This Aboubakar-- I'm assuming
you showered with the guy?

273
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:47,079
Paint me a word picture.

274
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,166
Hello.

275
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:51,467
Lil, is Barney there?

276
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:52,551
He's not answering his phone.

277
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,387
Mm, he's a little busy
right now.

278
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:55,537
It's Robin.

279
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,473
37... 38...

280
00:10:57,475 --> 00:10:59,175
Put her on speaker. 39...

281
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:01,043
When did you start being
able to do stuff like this?

282
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:02,878
A few months ago,
you had to catch your breath

283
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,879
after making a sandwich.

284
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:05,380
Barney, delete the Robin

285
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:08,317
and Patrice's BFF Fun Day
invite!

286
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,102
Did you break up with Nick yet?

287
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:11,487
I can't!
He just got some horrible call.

288
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:13,722
I think a family member might
have died or something.

289
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,024
Oh!
Yes! Yes!

290
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:16,742
Yes! Yes! Yes!

291
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,862
I mean, good that Robin
can't dump him.

292
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,396
The death part,
less good.

293
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:23,582
Robin, if you dump Nick,

294
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:26,452
he could get mad and
tear your blouse off.

295
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:28,370
And then he bites
you on the neck,

296
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:30,239
not super hard,
just on the brink

297
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,340
between pleasure
and pain.

298
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,958
And then that Danish slut
Nadia

299
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,844
bursts in...

300
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:37,579
You can't wait.
His groin will heal

301
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:39,581
and then before you know it,
you'll be marrying a man

302
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,268
who once ate
a vanilla-scented candle!

303
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,469
That was on me.

304
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:46,122
I shouldn't have left it
in the kitchen.

305
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:48,824
Though, it was lit.
Man, he dumb.

306
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,392
The invite goes live
in five minutes.

307
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:51,560
What?!

308
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,646
It goes out automatically
unless I stop it,

309
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,815
and that only happens
if I hear you dump Nick

310
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:57,616
on speakerphone
before then.

311
00:11:57,618 --> 00:11:59,318
Fine.

312
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:05,941
Hey, Nick. I'm
sorry about that.

313
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,893
Um, listen,

314
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,411
there's something I need

315
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:10,746
to talk to you about.

316
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:13,833
No, Robin, I'm sorry.
I'm like half here.

317
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,951
That phone call, it just...

318
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:18,804
I got some really bad news.

319
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,174
My doctor did an MRI...

320
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,926
and...

321
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,598
Oh... Oh, God.
What, what is it?

322
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,735
My groin injury is worse
than they thought.

323
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:34,803
I can't play basketball
for weeks.

324
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:37,990
Thank God. I thought he was
dying or something.

325
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:41,310
How many weeks?
How many weeks?!

326
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:43,245
Please tell me
it's not a tear

327
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:44,613
in the iliolumbar ligament.

328
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:46,749
It's a tear in the
"libioflumflar linament."

329
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:49,585
If it's a small tear,
he can still make playoffs.

330
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:50,586
It's a big tear.

331
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:52,171
He better not be out
for the season.

332
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:54,340
I'm out for the season.
Damn it!

333
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:57,359
They're going up against The
Number Crunchers without me.

334
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,379
It's an after-work basketball
league for lawyers

335
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:03,182
and accountants
and architects who sew.

336
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:05,634
I mean, who takes it
that seriously?

337
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:10,306
No...!

338
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,659
I just hate
letting Coach Eriksen down.

339
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:18,781
I would follow that man
through the gates of hell!

340
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:20,166
Winning.

341
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:24,353
What do we win when we beat
those Number Crunchers

342
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:26,121
a few short weeks hence?

343
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:27,540
A game? Sure.

344
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,125
A trophy? Sort of.

345
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:32,461
We win a $25 gift card
to Bennigan's,

346
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:34,997
but what is it
that we really win?

347
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,165
The game!

348
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,750
Yes, I said that Nick.

349
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,034
Right.

350
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:41,203
But we also win

351
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:42,671
the right to walk tall.

352
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:43,806
Oh!

353
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,375
The right to call ourselves
champions.

354
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:47,743
Yeah.
So we are gonna

355
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:49,261
go out and we are

356
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,679
gonna wipe the floor
with those accountants!

357
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:53,716
And afterwards,
we will feast like kings

358
00:13:53,718 --> 00:13:56,719
on Southwest Fajitas
and Cajun shrimp!

359
00:13:56,721 --> 00:14:01,390
And that check, that check will
be marginally less expensive!

360
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,108
Yeah! Yeah!

361
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,579
Now, they're probably gonna have
to pay full price for that meal.

362
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:12,234
Nick, you are so sweet,
but I just...

363
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:13,568
Good news is

364
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,088
it doesn't really matter
if it takes my groin pull

365
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,756
a little longer to heal,

366
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:20,575
so I may as well start
having sex again.

367
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:21,961
Listening.

368
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:23,012
Sickening.

369
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:24,179
Exiting.

370
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,386
Nick...
Huh?

371
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:32,221
I just...

372
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:34,556
Ah... I...

373
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:36,709
Hmm?
Um...

374
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,110
Mm-hmm?

375
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,261
Oh...

376
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:43,098
What do you think?

377
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,234
I think I am suddenly
in the mood

378
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:47,102
for something hot.

379
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:49,438
I see. Sounds like I should
order some cappuccinos.

380
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,207
Don't talk till
tomorrow morning.

381
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,993
She can't go home
with you, Nick.

382
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:56,462
Barney?
Why not?

383
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:59,748
Because Robin and I are in love.

384
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,812
Barney, what are
you doing here?

385
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:08,037
Taking care of something

386
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,238
you clearly can't do
on your own.

387
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,256
I'm sorry,

388
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,957
but you and Robin are done.

389
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,459
What? Robin, what is this?

390
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,411
Barney, look, I-I know
what you're doing, okay?

391
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,578
Please stop.

392
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,414
Robin doesn't want
to hurt your feelings

393
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,882
because you're a nice guy,

394
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:21,050
but she thinks

395
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:22,351
you're stupid and she hates you.

396
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:23,302
You're welcome.

397
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:24,553
Stop doing this.

398
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,088
I love her, Nick.

399
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,523
Look, he doesn't
love me.

400
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,442
He's just saying this because...

401
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:30,609
I love everything about her,

402
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:32,528
and I'm not a guy
who says that lightly.

403
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,980
I'm a guy who has faked love
his entire life.

404
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:36,598
I thought love
was just something

405
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,817
idiots thought they felt,

406
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,069
but this woman has
a hold on my heart

407
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:42,288
that I could not break
if I wanted to,

408
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,989
and there
have been times

409
00:15:43,991 --> 00:15:45,574
that I wanted to.

410
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:50,379
It has been overwhelming
and humbling

411
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:54,800
and even painful at times,
but I could not stop loving her

412
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:57,052
any more
than I could stop breathing.

413
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:02,341
I am hopelessly, irretrievably
in love with her.

414
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:06,328
More than she knows.

415
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,017
Robin,

416
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:13,569
is this true?

417
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:16,989
You heard him.

418
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,810
Oh, wow, it feels
like I have

419
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:24,196
a pulled groin muscle
in my heart.

420
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:25,948
Nick, I-I'm so sorry.

421
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,200
I just
think that maybe...

422
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:30,002
Pardon me.

423
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:32,838
But did you just also get
your heart broken?

424
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,458
Yes.
I just got

425
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,011
my heart broken, too!

426
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:41,163
Well, do the...
the two of you...

427
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:43,682
...want to come back
to my place?

428
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:46,802
Yes.
Yes. Come on.

429
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:52,107
<i>Thus concluded</i>
<i>the Autumn of Breakups,</i>

430
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,509
Wow.

431
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,194
- Crazy, right?
- Yeah,

432
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:57,196
you know what would be
really crazy?

433
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:58,364
If all of 'em

434
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:03,352
got it on-- Barney, Robin, Nick,
and those two women,

435
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:06,155
and you just know
Nadia's watching in the corner

436
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:07,857
with her pet snake.

437
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,742
Okay, why aren't
you two having sex?

438
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,126
What?

439
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:12,628
Excuse me?

440
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,997
Lily has been slobbering
over Robin's sex life

441
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:18,300
like a cartoon hobo watching
a pie cool on a windowsill,

442
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:19,668
and you--

443
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,137
the only other time you've ever
exercised this seriously

444
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:24,206
was when Lily had mono
freshman year

445
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,724
and I caught you doing
one-armed push-ups

446
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:28,043
with your genitals
over a bowl of ice.

447
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,144
So, when did

448
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,981
you stop doing it and why?

449
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:34,817
It was, you know,

450
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,436
before Marvin was born.

451
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:39,021
What?
Th-That's insane.

452
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:41,524
Well, you have to wait a while
after having a kid,

453
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:44,693
and, and then you're exhausted
from being up all night.

454
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:48,497
And then this uncanny
phenomenon began.

455
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:11,120
Wow,

456
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:12,688
you guys got to fix this.

457
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,523
It's not that easy.

458
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,894
Ted, having a kid

459
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:20,396
changes things.

460
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:24,483
You don't have the time
or energy, you're never alone.

461
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:26,619
Come here.

462
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:28,537
What are you doing?

463
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,122
Taking Marvin
for a walk

464
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:32,774
so you guys can
have some privacy.

465
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:34,710
Oh, Ted, come on,

466
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,528
that's, that's just not
the way that it works.

467
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,714
Yeah, it's not
like we can have sex on cue.

468
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:40,749
Yeah, I'll give you
guys plenty of time.

469
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:42,334
Maybe I'll even

470
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:43,969
swing by the gym, show Marvin

471
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:46,005
where his Uncle Ted
made "the shot."

472
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:47,590
If I'm late,

473
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:49,758
it's 'cause I've been delayed
by autograph seekers.

474
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,646
Oh, forgot Marvin's diaper bag.

475
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:54,647
Yowza!

476
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:56,949
Okay.

477
00:18:56,951 --> 00:18:59,818
And the Oscar for Best
Fake Romantic Speech

478
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,803
goes to Barney Stinson.

479
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,473
I'd like to thank all
the ladies over the years

480
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,475
with whom I've practiced
fake romantic speeches

481
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,243
and, of course,
Robin Scherbatsky

482
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,329
for being so
hypnotized by hog

483
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:12,364
that she needed me
to come and save her.

484
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:14,667
You know what?
I didn't need your help.

485
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:18,671
You were this close to ripping
off his misbuttoned shirt

486
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:22,091
and pulling down his
inside-out underpants.

487
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:25,210
I'll give you this,
you were pretty convincing.

488
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:27,963
Hey, tricking good-looking
idiots is kind of my thing.

489
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:30,182
No.

490
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,137
I mean, you were
really convincing.

491
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,224
Please.

492
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:40,809
I was bro-ing you out.

493
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:43,756
I'm just glad
he bought it so quick.

494
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:48,160
Any longer, I'd have had
to kiss you.

495
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:56,135
Hello.

496
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:58,103
Whoo, oh, my God,
Robin, BFF Fun Day!

497
00:19:58,105 --> 00:19:59,555
That's the most
amazing thing ever.

498
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:02,575
Like, you totally read my mind...
Hey, Patrice.

499
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,860
Oh, you got the
invite, great.

500
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:06,829
Uh, yeah, uh, let
me call you back.

501
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,541
This is so fantastic,
I can't even catch my breath.

502
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:09,399
Mm-hmm, yeah.

503
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,817
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

504
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,152
You know
what I forgot to do?

505
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:19,909
♪ Like a fool,
I went and stayed too long ♪

506
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:22,711

509
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,974
Hey, T-Squares.

510
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,388
Well, bad news.

511
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,407
Heard back
from the league office.

512
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:40,243
My shot is not going to count.

513
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:42,529
But onwards and upwards, right?

514
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:43,847
What do you cats want

515
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,698
to rap about, huh?

516
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,434
Listen, Coach... you're great.

517
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:52,422
And we all really
want to stay friends.

518
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:57,076
I can change, I can...

519
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:58,695
Come on, we, we had
some good times.

520
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:01,200
Things have been
weird lately and...

521
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,656
Is there another
architect? Just tell me.
