1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,250
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2008,</i>

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,033
<i>your aunt Robin was unemployed
and a little bit adrift,</i>

3
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,413
<i>so she valued her friendship
with Lily more than ever.</i>

4
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:11,315
Hey, so I hear Marshall
has to work late on Friday.

5
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:13,549
You know what that means...
ladies' night.

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,403
Actually, one of the teachers
at my school, Jillian,

7
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:17,901
is having a birthday party.

8
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:21,231
What?

9
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:22,118
It's just

10
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:25,376
I've never even heard of this
Jillian person before and suddenly

11
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:27,974
she's, like, your best friend.
You can't shut up about her.

12
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:30,913
Don't be jealous.
You and I hang out all the time.

13
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,660
Yeah, but Marshall's always there.

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,243
We don't get a lot of quality time
to talk, just the two of us.

15
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:37,798
That's not true.

16
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:40,886
So that's when the story
gets really good.

17
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:42,926
So, we go to the

18
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:47,854
place. And then that

19
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:50,905
guy asks about that thing
with the stuff

20
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:53,188
that I told you about
at that place that time.

21
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:54,772
Long story short

22
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:57,369
events transpired.

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,130
Oh, my God.

24
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:02,301
You and the guy from the mayor's office
did it in the UN building

25
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:04,160
under the desk of the
ambassador from Zaire?

26
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,272
Nice.

27
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:08,552
I just wish we could have
some girl time.

28
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,832
I love Marshall,
but he's always talk-blocking me.

29
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,288
So come out with
me and Jillian then.

30
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,581
Okay, but I don't want to stay out
too late because...

31
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:19,571
Remember that

32
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:22,110
thing last month after
I went to the place?

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,927
Well, you know who said it's fine,
but she gave me some stuff.

34
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:28,286
You still got that yeast infection...?

35
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,837
- I want you to enjoy this moment.
- What moment?

36
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:51,062
The last moment of you and I
being even slightly in competion

37
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:53,720
- for the title of Ted's best friend.
- Marshall's my best friend.

38
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:55,278
Exactly. It's a tie.

39
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,056
But all of that
is about to change.

40
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:00,836
Am I correct that
you are an architect?

41
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:03,601
My best friend would really know that,
but go on.

42
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,524
And what are you
currently designing?

43
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:09,657
Actually, we're renovating
the new York Public Library.

44
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:11,210
Ted, that's huge!

45
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,643
Not the New York Public Library.

46
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:16,760
It's the new public library in York,
North Dakota.

47
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:20,797
Their books are in two sections:
Fishin' and non-fishin'.

48
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,111
Then I think you are going to really
like what happened at work today.

49
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:28,260
And so, while those bribes
did destabilize the regime

50
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,637
and caused the death
of most of the royal family,

51
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:34,258
it did lead to looser
banking regulations in Rangoon.

52
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,534
So yay us.

53
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,492
Okay, last order of business.

54
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:39,842
It's been decided we're going
to move forward with plans

55
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:43,034
for Goliath National Bank's
new downtown headquarters.

56
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:46,465
- Who's gonna design it?
- Was my first question.

57
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,164
Who's gonna design it?

58
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:50,036
We've already approached
one firm about it.

59
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,097
This Swedish architecture collective
called Sven.

60
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,299
<i>Sven was this Swedish
architecture collective</i>

61
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,831
<i>revered for their bold,
innovative designs.</i>

62
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:03,447
<i>I hated those guys.</i>

63
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,312
I hate those guys.

64
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:08,473
- Swedish architecture collective.
- Lame.

65
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:10,501
- Pretentious.
- "We're not a company."

66
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,536
- "We're a collective."
- I know.

67
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:14,219
"We are Swedish."

68
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,054
"We are so cool with our baguettes
and our Eiffel Tower."

69
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,570
Dude, Sweden's not France.
You know that, right?

70
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:22,928
Oh, it's France.

71
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:26,589
So anyway, I say to Bilson...

72
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,056
Bilson, with all due respect...

73
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:32,816
No, I stand up,
and I say to Bilson...

74
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:35,034
Bilson, with all due respect...

75
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:35,974
Music.

76
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:39,090
Imagine patriotic music playing.

77
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:42,858
With all due respect,

78
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,895
it would be terrible

79
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:48,950
if a job that could go to
a hard-working American

80
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,492
architecture firm,

81
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:52,567
went to a bunch of French guys.

82
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,223
Where is our patriotism?

83
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:57,025
Our sense of country?

84
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:00,540
- Our love of all that is...
- Look, Stinson,

85
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:03,522
no one hates every other country
in the world as much as I do,

86
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:04,885
but you better have a point.

87
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:05,985
I do.

88
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:10,007
I know a fantastic American architect
who would be perfect for the job.

89
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:15,002
So, all you gotta do is come in,
pitch your design,

90
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,536
I get the board to approve it,
and the job is yours.

91
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:20,673
Do you realize what a hero I would be
if I brought this project to my firm?

92
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:22,274
And that's not even the best part.

93
00:04:22,374 --> 00:04:24,264
All three of us
are gonna be working together.

94
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,841
Ted can be on the conference call.

95
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:27,647
He can totally be
on the conference call.

96
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:29,787
- What's the conference call?
- The way it works is,

97
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:32,204
one of us will duck into
the other's office and say...

98
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,825
Marshall, the conference
call's about to start.

99
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,340
I'm sorry, guys, I gotta go.

100
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:39,826
And then we go up
to the roof of the building,

101
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:41,415
and drink beer.

102
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:44,837
This is awesome.
Drinking at work.

103
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:46,669
We're basically Mad Men.

104
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:49,422
We are! We're such Mad Men!

105
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:51,312
I'm gonna go smack
a secretary on the ass.

106
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,019
That's totally what they would do
on that show.

107
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,581
What show?

108
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:01,103
And then, we throw crumpled up
beer cans at pigeons.

109
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:04,080
- I don't do that.
- I totally want to do that.

110
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,549
- Well, I am gonna make that happen.
- Seriously, Barney,

111
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,588
after everything I went through
with Stella,

112
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,209
getting me this opportunity...

113
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:12,444
It really means a lot.

114
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:13,588
<i>It really did.</i>

115
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:16,846
<i>You see, kids, when I became
an architect, I had one dream</i>

116
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,938
<i>to contribute a building
to the skyline of New York City.</i>

117
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,640
<i>I wanted to be able to point to one
of those buildings and say,</i>

118
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,924
<i>see that one?
That one right there?</i>

119
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,588
<i>That's mine.</i>

120
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:30,297
<i>This job was my opportunity
to do just that.</i>

121
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:37,430
Your friend's having her birthday here?

122
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,210
What's she turning, 19?

123
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:42,083
Believe me, this isn't her scene.

124
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:45,059
She probably just didn't know
what kind of place this was.

125
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,905
Over here, you sexy bitch!
We've got bottle service!

126
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:53,045
Oh, my God.

127
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:57,687
At school, she's so quiet and normal.
I had no idea she's

128
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,746
she's a Woo Girl.

129
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,614
<i>What's a Woo Girl?
Let me explain.</i>

130
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,592
<i>A Woo Girl is a type of young woman,</i>

131
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,896
<i>who, like the cuckoo bird
or the whip-poor-will,</i>

132
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,349
<i>gets her name from the signature sound
she makes.</i>

133
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:14,005
<i>Now, a woo can be elicited
in many different ways.</i>

134
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:16,919
<i>From a certain song
coming on the jukebox...</i>

135
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,223
Oh, my God,
this song is totally about me.

136
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:25,439
<i>to half-priced shots.</i>

137
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,240
<i>from a ride on a mechanical bull...</i>

138
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,513
<i>to, well, pretty much anything.</i>

139
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:38,573
Oh, my God, I was worried
that I didn't feed the cat,

140
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:41,217
but then I rembered that I did.

141
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:47,915
I swear, at school
Jillian seems so un-woo-y.

142
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:50,648
Yeah, she doesn't look wooish.

143
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:52,828
Maybe she only observes
the high holidays,

144
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:54,696
like Mardi Gras and Spring Break.

145
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:56,874
Maybe she's just a cultural Woo.

146
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:01,554
Now... go easy on me.
It's a work in progress.

147
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:05,412
Ted, this is amazing.

148
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,620
The detail. The shading. The

149
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,636
playfulness of the lines.

150
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:13,380
This is exactly what Princess Leia
would look like topless.

151
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,312
My way of saying thanks.

152
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,922
So... you want to see my designs
for the building?

153
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:19,583
Nah, I'm good.

154
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:22,510
So get this.

155
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,124
Lily just texted me.
She's at that bar Giddyups

156
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:27,011
with a bunch of Woo Girls.

157
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:30,862
Oh, my God, you guys,

158
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:33,468
my boob just fell out
of my top at the bar.

159
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:36,102
Trick! I pulled it out for a free drink!

160
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,777
So, Jillian, I hear when you're

161
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:43,750
not flashing bartenders,
you teach the second grade.

162
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:44,851
What's that like?

163
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:45,893
So rewarding.

164
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:48,148
I don't know if you're familiar
with the RYE technique,

165
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,487
but it derives from the progressive
educational philosophy

166
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,560
of Rudolf Steiner, who founded
the Waldorf School, which...

167
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,080
Oh, my God. I love this song!

168
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:59,028
Come on, you lazy skanks,
let's dance!

169
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,508
- You, too, you dumb whores.
- No, thank you

170
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:06,891
ignorant hussy.

171
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,913
Why, Lily Aldrin, you sly minx.

172
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,777
I've been saying for years
that our gang need a Woo Girl,

173
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:17,158
and here you've been hiding
a whole batch of them from me.

174
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:20,094
We do not need a Woo Girl.
No one needs a Woo Girl.

175
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:21,510
Be careful, Lily.

176
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:24,980
The world absolutely needs Woo Girls.

177
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,313
If there were no Woo Girls,
there'd be no Girls Gone Wild,

178
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:30,200
no bachelorette parties,

179
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,576
no Las Vegas poolside bars...

180
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,848
All the things that you hold
dearest, Lily, would be gone.

181
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,227
- Those are none of the things...
- The souvenir shot glass industry

182
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:40,485
would collapse.

183
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:43,240
So would the body glitter industry and

184
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,832
the stretch Hummer rental industry.

185
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:50,132
Tiny cowboy hats
would be worn only

186
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:51,778
by tiny cowboys.

187
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:55,582
And when "Brown Eyed Girl"
would come up on the jukebox,

188
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,174
all you would hear

189
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,044
would be silence.

190
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:02,224
And "Brown Eyed Girl."

191
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,774
But who would woo, Lily?

192
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:06,562
Who would woo?

193
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,434
Would you?

194
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:11,122
Would you

195
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:12,975
woo?

196
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:15,733
Who wants to name my boobs?!

197
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,847
Now if you'll excuse me, I

198
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:23,103
have a date with Hannity and Colmes.

199
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,543
<i>Over the next couple of weeks,
I do have into work.</i>

200
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:30,623
<i>It felt great to be working on something
that I really cared about.</i>

201
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:33,205
<i>Finally, the morning
of the presentation arrived.</i>

202
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:37,867
And we believe this timeless design
will radiate the strength

203
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:39,441
and stability

204
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:41,802
that is Goliath National Bank.

205
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:43,525
Thank you, gentlemen.

206
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,267
<i>I left there feeling pretty good
about my chances.</i>

207
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:51,253
<i>Later that night, we ran into Barney.</i>

208
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,522
Give me the good news.

209
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:56,175
You didn't get it.

210
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:57,925
What?

211
00:09:58,143 --> 00:09:59,143
The board

212
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,191
decided to go with Sven.

213
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,053
I can't believe I didn't get it.

214
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,049
I really thought I nailed the pitch.

215
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:18,709
Why would they go with Sven?

216
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,135
I did everything I could
to change their minds.

217
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,791
But they wouldn't budge.

218
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,189
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:26,922
This really sucks.

220
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:30,177
After the way these last
couple of months have gone...

221
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,380
I guess I need this more
than I thought I did.

222
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,524
You want to go down to the current
GNB building and just, like...

223
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,288
I don't know,

224
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:44,630
just pee on it a little bit?

225
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:48,693
Yeah, I think I need that.

226
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:52,202
Finish your beer. File the tank.

227
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:57,561
What happen's?

228
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,914
Ted didn't get that job.

229
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:03,138
But that's not the biggest
disappointment of the day.

230
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:06,125
- What?
- We saw you woo.

231
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,689
- Saw who woo?
- Saw you woo.

232
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:10,407
- I didn't woo.
- You did, too.

233
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:13,383
- That's not true.
- Your nose just grew.

234
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,775
You're, like, best friends
with Jillian now?

235
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:17,977
It's just...

236
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,260
You're married, Lily,
but I'm still single.

237
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,838
Whenever I hang out with you,

238
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:24,052
I'm usually the third wheel
to you and Marshall.

239
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:26,303
Sometimes, it's fun to go out
with other single women

240
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:28,383
and do stuff that you don't want to.

241
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:29,553
Like what?

242
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:31,531
Like woo, Lily.

243
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:32,978
Like woo.

244
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:34,821
- I can woo.
- That's not true.

245
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,542
- I can, too.
- It's just not you.

246
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:46,218
I just want to say, I know
you guys went with Sven, but...

247
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:48,985
Ted Mosby is tremendously talented, and

248
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,903
I think he would have done
a hell of a job.

249
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,171
I agree.
That's why I voted for him.

250
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:56,124
So, then, it's agreed.
From now on,

251
00:11:56,294 --> 00:11:59,194
all ATM fees are now called
Freedom Charges.

252
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:01,273
Conference call. Now.

253
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,144
You got something you want to tell me?

254
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:08,314
Damn it.

255
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,112
I told Heather to put everything back
on your desk the way it was.

256
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:13,899
Bilson told me he wanted
to give the job to Ted.

257
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,267
So what happened?

258
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:19,802
Okay, fine.

259
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:22,509
will radiate the strength

260
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,866
and stability

261
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,054
that is Goliath National Bank.

262
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:27,962
Thank you, gentlemen.

263
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:36,815
So?

264
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,887
That was great. I love it.

265
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:41,156
Looks like we got our guy.

266
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:43,528
I don't think we even need
to meet with...

267
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,108
I am Sven Jorgensen.

268
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:49,537
With me are Sven Pilsen and
Sven Johanssen, and we are...

269
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,664
You are Goliath National Bank.

270
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,874
You are cutting edge.
You are new. You are fresh.

271
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,467
Women want to be with you,
men wish to harm you,

272
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:02,525
but the fool who dares challenge you
shall be crushed!

273
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:05,849
Your headquarters will tell
the world of these facts.

274
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,081
Oh, and one more thing...
don't look now!

275
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:13,030
Which of you is Barney Stinson,
head of the search committee?

276
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:14,718
Oh, my God. That's me!

277
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:18,126
You, Barney Stinson, are a man of power
and virility.

278
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:21,525
Your office shall be here,
in the head of a tyrannosaurus rex.

279
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,027
I never knew it till now,
but I've always dreamed of that.

280
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:28,954
On your large desk of Honduran rosewood
shall be this button.

281
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,562
- What does the button do?
- Press it! Press it for glory!

282
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:40,912
This is the most awesome building
in the universe.

283
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,681
There is no way this building
could be more awesome.

284
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:46,207
There is a strip club
in the letter "N."

285
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,996
What the hell is the matter
with you?! This is.

286
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,274
Ted's big break!
And then you sold him out

287
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:56,865
because you wanted to work
in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus rex,

288
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,700
which, incidentally, if you knew
anything about dinosaurs, is really,

289
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:00,941
really small.

290
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,343
Marshall, this isn't
about my office.

291
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:05,899
Ted's building was good.
Sven's was better.

292
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:08,899
And I am not going to let the fact
that I am Ted's best friend

293
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:10,417
be a factor in business.

294
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,370
You didn't pick Sven's building
because it was better.

295
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,483
You picked it because you wanted
to work in a cool dinosaur office.

296
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:15,696
That's a lie!

297
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,006
I picked it because it...

298
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:21,630
It breathes fire, Marshall.

299
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:23,810
"Fire Marshall."

300
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,523
- I didn't even notice.
- How could you do this to Ted

301
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:30,503
after everything he's been through
with Stella?!

302
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,983
You're just being selfish.

303
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:33,768
Marshall, I would never

304
00:14:33,938 --> 00:14:36,132
make a business decision
for selfish reasons.

305
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:37,653
I am a professional.

306
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,823
Now, come on.

307
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,457
Let's get a nice daytime drunk going,
and throw empties at pigeons.

308
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,265
No. For two reasons. One,

309
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,882
pigeons are smarter than you think.

310
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:47,854
They hold grudges. And, two

311
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,327
this is our last conference call,
Mr. Stinson.

312
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,463
There are repercussions
to screwing over a friend.

313
00:14:53,563 --> 00:14:55,248
- Like what?
- Like this.

314
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:23,493
Oh, my God, you guys.

315
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:26,027
Last night, we raised
$10,000 for my charity

316
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:28,223
to help combat childhood illiteracy.

317
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:30,205
It's a really serious issue.

318
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,467
Someone just earned herself
an ass-first ride

319
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,291
down the dance floor spank canyon!

320
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,453
Lily, what are you doing here?

321
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:51,709
Just doing the fun things
you single girls do.

322
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,053
What's with the plastic fireman's hat?

323
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:56,567
I didn't have a cowboy hat,

324
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:59,615
and today was fire safety day
at school, so...

325
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:03,059
Oh, my God, bitch.
This is our anthem.

326
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:05,187
Really? Who sings this?

327
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:08,703
Is LL Cool J still doing things?

328
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:12,017
This is great, Svens.

329
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,724
You guys are so much cooler
than Marshall.

330
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:17,325
He doesn't even own a unitard.

331
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:19,005
Who wants a brew?

332
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,913
I don't understand.
Where is the conference call?

333
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:25,899
This is the conference call.
Get it?

334
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:28,109
In America, when we work late,

335
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,150
we lie about a conference call,

336
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,090
and we come up here and we drink
a few beers. It's awesome.

337
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,769
This is a waste of time.
Push-ups!

338
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:39,806
Misty, you are such a slut.

339
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:41,480
Let's do another shot.

340
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:46,791
You're the slut, you skank.
Shots are on you.

341
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:51,801
No, bitch, shots are on you.
You're such a whore.

342
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:57,634
You're all a bunch of prostitutes.
You probably have STDs.

343
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:02,834
Let's go dance.

344
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,449
This isn't working.
You shouldn't be here.

345
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:14,081
I get it. Because I'm happily married,
I'm some kind of loser?

346
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:15,720
Exactly the opposite.

347
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:19,010
Why do you think the Woo Girls
have to woo

348
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,849
when they win a game of beer pong,

349
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:23,035
or when a hot guy takes his shirt off?

350
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:25,516
It's because that is as good
as life gets for them.

351
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:28,304
They're really sad people.

352
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:31,180
And, when they hang out with someone
who's got it all figured out

353
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:32,546
someone like you

354
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:33,942
it bums them out.

355
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:35,559
It takes away their woo.

356
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:38,934
You're just saying that so I don't feel
like an old married lady.

357
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:40,981
Look at those girls, Lily.

358
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:44,586
Look at them and listen to what
their woo's are really saying.

359
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:47,608
"I cry in the shower!"

360
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:51,451
"I've never been
on a seconde date!"

361
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:55,628
"What if I nerver
get to be a Mom?!"

362
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:59,337
"I'm secretly in
love with Jillian!"

363
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:06,472
"My career and love life
are heading nowhere!"

364
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:09,615
Those poor girls... and Ted.

365
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,702
I just want to go
give them all a hug.

366
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,484
Lily, right now I'm like them.

367
00:18:14,654 --> 00:18:18,276
I'm unemployed, I'm single,
I'm a little lost.

368
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:19,695
So

369
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:22,183
Every once in a while,
I need to woo,

370
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:25,061
but when I need to talk
about something real,

371
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,848
you're the one I turn to.

372
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,994
- You're my best friend.
- And you're mine.

373
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:33,087
And I promise I'll make more time
for just us.

374
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:35,923
Marshall doesn't have to tag along
to everything we do.

375
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:38,423
Hey, have you guys tried
these purple hooter test tube shots?

376
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,549
I've had five of 'em.

377
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,455
I don't even think
there's alcohol in here.

378
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:44,009
- Where'd you get that hat?
- What hat?

379
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:50,549
- We fired Sven.
- What?

380
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,245
Yeah, those guys were idiots.

381
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:54,562
I mean, sure,
they had some cool ideas

382
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:58,327
some really cool ideas. Actually,
I wonder if it's not too late to...

383
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,571
The point is, you got the job.

384
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:02,781
Really?

385
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:05,441
The search committee realized
they made the wrong decision.

386
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,869
Plus, you really mean a lot to them
and they want you to be happy.

387
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,603
That's weird.

388
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,439
Look, Ted, your design was the best,

389
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:15,981
and you deserve it.

390
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,592
There's also something
that you should know

391
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,476
about why you didn't get
the job in the first place.

392
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:25,183
- You see, Ted...
- It was Bilson.

393
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:30,195
Bilson just wanted to have an office
in a dinosaur head,

394
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:32,059
but Barney convinced him

395
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,626
- that it was really, really stupid.
- Well, you know.

396
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:36,971
Thank you, Barney.

397
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,695
I can't believe this.

398
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:41,624
I just got our firm the biggest
account we've ever had.

399
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:45,101
"Now only my
love life's a disaster!"

400
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,759
Next round's on me.

401
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:53,204
Why'd you let me off the hook?

402
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:57,707
You did the right thing.
Seemed like you deserved a bye.

403
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,958
Plus, it would have really bummed
Ted out, and he's finally

404
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,502
happy right now.

405
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:07,776
You really are Ted's best friend.

406
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,474
And so am I. It's a tie.

407
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:13,796
Thanks, Marshall.

408
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:16,574
<i>Marshall wound up caving
and telling me the truth about Barney,</i>

409
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,838
<i>like, ten minutes later,</i>

410
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:20,692
<i>at which point we tied Uncle Barney
to the mechanical bull,</i>

411
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:22,840
<i>cranked it up to a setting called
"Paint Mixer"</i>

412
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,085
<i>and went home.</i>

413
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:26,664
- I love you, man.
- Love you, too, buddy.

414
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:28,638
Hey, you going to
ride the bull tonight?

415
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:31,261
Not if you paid me.
I have an inner ear thing.

416
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:33,648
<i>It was a pretty great night.</i>

417
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:39,542
Three hours.
That's a bull record.

418
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,286
That's right, ladies.

419
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:46,351
Jillian, you know what would be
really crazy, and funny,

420
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:47,753
and stupid to do tonight?

421
00:20:47,853 --> 00:20:50,734
If you and me find a guy
and have a three-way.

422
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,896
Maybe.
If we found the right guy.

423
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,788
Yeah, and, if we don't
find the right guy.

424
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:01,110
- Maybe you and I could just...
- You know who's really cute?

425
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,760
That guy Ted. Let's go find him.
