1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:04,219
<i>Every architect can point to that one
design that changed their career.</i>

2
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:08,079
<i>For me, it was around the time
of my 31st birthday.</i>

3
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:12,201
It wasn't a museum or a concert hall
or a skyscraper.

4
00:00:12,764 --> 00:00:14,053
<i>It was something else.</i>

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:17,765
We're opening a restaurant called
Rib Town, and we want it to be shaped...

6
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:19,895
Like a cowboy hat.

7
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:24,605
Look, I need the work.
I don't have any other options.

8
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,774
- There's always that teaching job.
- Yeah,

9
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:30,394
I didn't work this hard to be stuck
in some crappy, dead-end teaching job.

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,534
- No offense, Lily.
- I got peed on three times today.

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,033
No arguments here.

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,528
I just gotta nail this hat building so,
I'll see you all in three days.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,458
<i>For the next three days, I worked harder
than I'd ever worked in my life.</i>

14
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:47,754
<i>And I got... nowhere.</i>

15
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,270
Hey, Ted, whatcha doing?

16
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,428
Designing a building shaped
like a hat.

17
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:57,555
- Now a good time to chat?
- No.

18
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:01,488
- So, what do you think of Robin?
- I really need to get to work, so...

19
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:04,736
Great.
Say you and I went suit-shopping,

20
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:07,801
and you happened upon
a beautiful suit,

21
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:10,026
a beautiful Canadian suit.

22
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,537
Double-breasted.

23
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,111
You try it on, but it's not exactly
the right fit for you.

24
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:19,661
So, you put it back.
Then I try it on.

25
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,009
I don't really want

26
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,624
to take the same suit that you had
your eye on, but at the same time,

27
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:28,023
I really like that suit.

28
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:32,538
Buy the suit, Barney.
You clearly care about it.

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,342
Tell the suit how you feel.

30
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,598
But Ted, rember that
that was your answer because...

31
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:45,878
The suit is Robin.

32
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:47,555
I know!

33
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:49,662
Right?

34
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:51,901
I'm with you, buddy.

35
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:53,283
You are now.

36
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,073
- Because I explained it to you.
- What do you talk...

37
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,895
Come on, dude, you've been at this
for three days without a break.

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,540
It's your birthday. Come up to the roof
and have a beer with me.

39
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,327
No can do.
Presentation is tomorrow.

40
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:22,163
Hat buildings
don't design themselves.

41
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:24,703
It's a rib joint for fat tourists.

42
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:27,348
Just make sure the doors are wide
and the chairs are reinforced.

43
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:30,254
Now, birthday beer on the roof.
Let's go!

44
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:32,437
Why do you want me to come up
to the roof so bad?

45
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:35,213
- Are you throwing me a surprise party?
- What?

46
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,564
Ted, we threw you
a surprise party last year.

47
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:41,098
Okay, you don't get
two surprise parties in a row.

48
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,316
The fact that anyone showed up
at the first one was surprise enough.

49
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:47,021
Right?
Two surprise parties in a row!

50
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,484
That is rich!

51
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:50,753
That is rich!

52
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,111
Classic!

53
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:55,727
Classic...
He still won't come up.

54
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:58,699
Come on. What the crap?!

55
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:01,452
I knew having a second surprise party
was a bad idea.

56
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,330
Yes, Robin, I know.
This party is

57
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:06,596
it's... it's a disaster.

58
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:09,829
It was my idea.
I take responsibility.

59
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:14,131
And there's really only one thing
to do about it.

60
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:22,473
- Marshall, no.
- Lily, I have to do this!

61
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,642
No point in putting it off
any longer.

62
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:28,104
<i>I should explain.
You see, a few years earlier...</i>

63
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,985
Forget it.
This is so not pimped out.

64
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:37,037
If anything, this is pimped in.

65
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:41,147
You know who knows how to live?
Those people.

66
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,328
<i>The rooftop patio
one building over from ours.</i>

67
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,278
<i>Across a chasm of just six or seven feet
awaited a landscaped paradise.</i>

68
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,548
<i>And best of all...</i>

69
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:52,396
That looks to be one

70
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:54,088
hot

71
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:55,985
tub.

72
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:57,787
Great. How do we get over there?

73
00:03:57,912 --> 00:04:00,344
What are we gonna do? Jump?

74
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,533
I can jump that far.

75
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:16,428
Marshall, lately it takes you
two tries to get off the sofa.

76
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,253
You can't jump that far.

77
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:21,449
- Really?
- Really.

78
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,145
Watch me.

79
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:32,413
<i>But he didn't jump.</i>

80
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,989
This actually is kind of nice.

81
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,825
Right? Right?

82
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,782
<i>And in the years that followed,
he kept almost jumping.</i>

83
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,635
<i>But each time, without fail...</i>

84
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:56,731
Here we go.

85
00:04:56,856 --> 00:04:58,152
<i>He didn't jump.</i>

86
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,697
But don't worry.
'Cause if I can make this jump tonight,

87
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:04,325
it's totally gonna save the party.

88
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,702
Honey, please get down from there.

89
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:11,129
When Evel Knievel sat astride
his star-spangled rocket

90
00:05:11,254 --> 00:05:13,293
on the rim of Snake River Canyon,

91
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:16,462
do you think his wife said,
"Honey, get down from there"?

92
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:19,908
For the last time,
I am not Linda Knievel!

93
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:22,593
I will never be Linda Knievel!

94
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,388
You don't need to remind me.

95
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:38,588
Marshall, please don't do this.
Please don't jump.

96
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,736
I'm sorry, Lily,
but I gotta do this.

97
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:42,613
- You can't do this.
- Why?

98
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:44,914
You want a reason?

99
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,017
I'll give you a reason.

100
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,590
I'm pregnant.

101
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:50,621
Oh, my God!

102
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,707
Oh, my God, really?!

103
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:56,085
Lily, I mean, I noticed
that you gained some weight lately...

104
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:58,963
I was lying, you jerk!

105
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,299
Go ahead and jump.
I hope you die!

106
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:07,967
That's all the permission I need.

107
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,395
Listen, Robin...

108
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,410
- There's something I have to tell you.
- But wait.

109
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:24,113
Before you do,
I have to tell you something first.

110
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:27,094
What is it?

111
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:29,953
I think I'm in love with you.

112
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:43,412
It's Ted. Everybody!

113
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:49,236
- Hey, Ted, what's up?
- It's here, Lily.

114
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,418
It's looking at me.

115
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,701
- What is?
- The goat.

116
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:58,912
<i>Now, I've told you some of the story
of the goat already.</i>

117
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,494
<i>How Aunt Lily invited a local farmer
to come talk to her class,</i>

118
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:03,996
<i>and how he brought a goat,</i>

119
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:06,161
<i>and how he told the whole class
what he was gonna do</i>

120
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:07,905
<i>to the goat later that day.</i>

121
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,007
<i>And how Aunt Lily,
in a fit of mercy,</i>

122
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:13,260
<i>bought the goat off the guy
in order to commute its sentence.</i>

123
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:15,596
Something amazing has happened.

124
00:07:15,764 --> 00:07:18,818
I was talking to Robin,
I was all set to tell her how I feel,

125
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:21,727
but before I could,
you'll never believe what she said.

126
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:23,520
I think I'm in love with you.

127
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,231
- What did you say?!
- What do you think I said?

128
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,359
What would anyone say
to something like that?

129
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,657
Robin, listen.

130
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:34,846
You're great.

131
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:38,711
I mean, you're really awesome,
but I mean, we're friends.

132
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,579
It's probably a bad idea.

133
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:42,664
I guess you're right.

134
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,460
Have a good party.

135
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:47,956
You too, kiddo.

136
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,767
- What?!
- It's like, as soon as she said that,

137
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:55,177
no more feelings.
I'm not in love with her anymore.

138
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,749
So, you've been in love with this girl
for the past year,

139
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,745
and the second
she reciprocates those feelings,

140
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,477
just like that, you're over her.

141
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,437
How great is that?!

142
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:14,530
This is a washcloth.

143
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:15,918
Not food.

144
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,883
What the...?

145
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:38,611
This is it.

146
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:41,064
Here

147
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:43,084
we... go!

148
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,401
This is it.

149
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:49,398
Tracey, Tracey,
tell Lily what you just told me.

150
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,231
- That I just moved to New York?
- No, no, but tell her how you got here.

151
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,201
I just got off the bus from Iowa.

152
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,442
I just got off the bus from Iowa!

153
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,291
How lucky is it that an aspiring

154
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,416
dancer

155
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:06,738
just off the bus from Iowa runs into

156
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:08,909
the producer of the Rockettes?

157
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:12,504
I feel like I'm in one of those
classic show biz stories.

158
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:15,591
Honey, you are. You really are.

159
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:18,778
Tracey, why don't you make me
one of those rum and beers

160
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,762
- that your dad loves so much?
- Sure thing!

161
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,309
- Damn it.
- What?

162
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,932
Everybody always says,
"Don't tell Lily."

163
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:31,915
"Lily can't keep a secret."
And, usually, they're right.

164
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,151
But this time, I kept the secret.

165
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,884
And then you come along
with this crap

166
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:41,006
and you force me to pull
an old classic Lily and spill the beans!

167
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,660
What beans? There's beans?

168
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:45,954
There's beans.

169
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:47,957
The suit is Robin.

170
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,508
I know!

171
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:51,627
Right?

172
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:53,879
I'm with you, buddy.

173
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,286
You are now.

174
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:58,717
- Because I explained it to you.
- What do you talk...

175
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:01,780
There you go.

176
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,228
Crap.

177
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,798
- He said that?
- Oh, my God!

178
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:14,733
What a tremendous
ground-breaking surprise!

179
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:16,517
- How long have you known?
- 8 months.

180
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:19,238
And you've kept it a secret since then?
Good for you.

181
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:22,051
Good for you, Lily.

182
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:24,701
I mean, what a bombshell.
Who saw that coming?

183
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,108
- How long have you known?
- Seven months, 29 days.

184
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,163
God, what am I going to do?

185
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,333
I don't know.

186
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:32,042
What are you going to do?

187
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,920
I'm going to marry Barney
in a big church wedding.

188
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,498
We're going to move
to some sleepy New Hampshire town

189
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:38,924
and open a bed-and-breakfast.

190
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,680
- Really?
- No!

191
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:43,345
It's Barney.

192
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:44,557
I mean

193
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:46,385
it's Barney.

194
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:48,674
But it's Barney.

195
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:50,477
I got to tell him no.

196
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,372
Oh, man, you're going
to break his...

197
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,568
Whatever it is that pumps
that black sludge through his veins.

198
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:59,278
Crap. You're right.

199
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,957
The first time Barney
expresses feelings for a girl

200
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:03,499
and she rejects him?

201
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,073
And not just any girl. I mean...

202
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:08,844
It will destroy him.

203
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,228
Okay, well, first of all...

204
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:19,129
Second of all,
there is a maneuver you can try.

205
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:21,378
It's high-risk,
but it's also high-reward.

206
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:24,056
For lack of a better term,
I'm going to call it...

207
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:27,306
- The Mosby.
- The Mosby?

208
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:29,364
No, she couldn't Mosby him.

209
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,644
- She could Mosby the crap out of him.
- What's the Mosby?

210
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:34,884
Robin, you remember
your first date with Ted?

211
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,124
You wanted to hop on the T-train
and take a ride downtown.

212
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:39,901
I was ready to jump that turnstile.

213
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:42,696
What changed all that?

214
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,447
I think I'm in love with you.

215
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:46,618
What?

216
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,286
The Mosby!

217
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:52,101
- That is genius.
- Thank you.

218
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:53,226
And

219
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:54,684
excuse me.

220
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,420
I mean, you're very pretty,
but you're freakishly tall,

221
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:01,035
and you don't believe in ghosts.

222
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,451
So, when she said she thinks
she's in love with me,

223
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:07,679
she meant the opposite.

224
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:08,848
Exactly.

225
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,016
And look how well it worked.
You're back to normal.

226
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,851
Yes. Yes, I am.

227
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,707
And it is great. It's awesome.

228
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:19,956
- So, Robin's not in love with me.
- Nope.

229
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:22,904
Why not?

230
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,324
Mr. Goat?

231
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,030
Mr. Goat?

232
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,412
That's it.

233
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,391
Stupid goat.

234
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:56,853
I do not understand your
fascination with this washcloth.

235
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:59,648
I guess that's what happens
when you have a brain the size of a...

236
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,047
Marshall, can you just go get Ted?

237
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:14,543
Lily, I was just about to jump.

238
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,481
Didn't you hear me saying "Okay"
over and over again?

239
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,514
Oh, I'm sorry.
Go ahead and jump.

240
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:20,682
No, it's fine.

241
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:22,207
Sorry, everybody.

242
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:24,508
Lily won't let me jump.

243
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:31,922
Thank God.

244
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,287
Hospital!

245
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,849
What happened exactly?

246
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:51,489
What happened is
you let a freaking wild animal

247
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,064
into our apartment.

248
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:54,815
I was savaged.

249
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:59,053
That is the sweetest, cutest
little goat in the whole world.

250
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:02,674
Sweetest, cutest little goat
in the whole world?

251
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:04,806
<i>I was pretty sleep-deprived
at this point,</i>

252
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,793
<i>so this probably isn't
how it really happened,</i>

253
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:08,229
<i>but here's how I rember it.</i>

254
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,292
So, you're the guy who tried
to make it with a goat?

255
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,545
If anything, that goat
tried to make it with me.

256
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:36,424
- Can I go, please?
- Sure, you can go.

257
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,469
But remember, buddy,
"baa" means "baa."

258
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:45,641
Great. Great. Now I'm going to be late
for my presentation.

259
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,894
Thanks a lot, Mr. Goat.

260
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,438
Mr. Goat? Ted, that goat's a girl.

261
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,444
- Her name's Missy.
- You got beat up by a girl.

262
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,519
So.

263
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:05,995
- You're in love with me.
- What? Yeah. Very much.

264
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:09,257
Okay, you can knock it off.
Lily told me.

265
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:10,459
Damn it.

266
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,627
I can't believe you would do that.

267
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,534
It's just...

268
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,297
Like, I care about you, Barney.

269
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:17,340
And...

270
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:19,910
This kind of stuff,
the emotional stuff?

271
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:23,179
It's not your thing.
I thought I'd save you the trouble.

272
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:25,306
Maybe I don't want
to be saved the trouble.

273
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:27,183
Maybe I want the trouble.

274
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:30,452
I haven't wanted the trouble
in a long time.

275
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:33,110
But with you, the trouble
doesn't seem so

276
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,950
troubling.

277
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:37,902
I don't know. I thought...

278
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:40,905
I guess I thought
you felt the same way.

279
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:43,449
Maybe I do.

280
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:46,367
I don't know.

281
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:49,316
I'm not exactly the biggest
confronter of feelings.

282
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,409
I mean, clearly, there's
something between us.

283
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:56,696
Maybe my head was saying,
"Nip it in the bud"

284
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:58,417
because my heart was

285
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,437
saying something else.

286
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,410
Look...

287
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:05,638
I have feelings for you, Barney.

288
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:08,683
Maybe I even love you.

289
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:11,602
This is going pretty fast,
don't you think?

290
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,475
- What?
- We have a good friendship going.

291
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,856
Why screw up a good thing?

292
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:17,529
Friends?

293
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:19,913
Friends.

294
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:23,571
My God. You just did it again.
You just Mosby'd me.

295
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,033
- I did not.
- You did. You little minx.

296
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,119
Okay, you're right.
I did just Mosby you.

297
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,287
Why are you so afraid
of giving this a chance?

298
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:33,207
Because I am scared
of how much I like you.

299
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,709
This is a bad idea.

300
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:36,794
You're right. This is a mistake.

301
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,179
- Yes. No.
- I love you.

302
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:40,047
- Let's be friends.
- Friends, then.

303
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:41,717
- I love you.
- Let's get married.

304
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:43,884
- No, you're smothering me.
- Okay, forget it.

305
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:51,684
You know what?
We can sort this out later.

306
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:54,077
- That sounds good.
- That sounds good. Let's go.

307
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,610
<i>It had been a long and crazy night,</i>

308
00:16:57,735 --> 00:16:59,859
<i>but that morning, against all odds,</i>

309
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,486
<i>I made it to my presentation.</i>

310
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:03,423
Here you have it, gentlemen.

311
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:04,548
Rib Town.

312
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,157
Right?

313
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:07,842
Right?

314
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,621
Ted, listen. You're great,

315
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,614
and you've done a real

316
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,428
special job here,

317
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:18,641
and you're going to make
some other restaurant

318
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:19,962
very happy someday,

319
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,130
but

320
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,299
we have

321
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:23,708
decided to go

322
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:25,705
another direction here.

323
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,117
What?

324
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:29,003
Feast your eyes on...

325
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:31,364
Rib Town!

326
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:36,054
Sven.

327
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,234
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm never eating ribs again.

328
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:43,944
Yeah, right.

329
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:45,644
I am never

330
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:47,509
eating ribs

331
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:48,809
again!

332
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:51,771
In front of Ted!

333
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:53,871
This is a disaster.

334
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,800
How am I going
to come back from this?

335
00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:59,436
Okay, I'm just going to ask this.

336
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,420
Do you really want
to come back from this?

337
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:04,999
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Architecture is killing you, Ted,

338
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:07,510
and it's killing us to watch it
killing you.

339
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:10,685
You're like that goat
with the washcloth.

340
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,579
You want it so bad,

341
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:14,983
and every time the world tries
to take it away from you,

342
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,435
you keep grabbing it.

343
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:17,978
But you know what?

344
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:20,815
It's just a washcloth.
Why do you even want it?

345
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:23,816
Because I have to be an architect.

346
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:24,941
That's...

347
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,904
That's the plan.

348
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,157
Screw the plan.
I planned on being a famous artist.

349
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:32,944
Marshall planned on being
an environmental lawyer.

350
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,538
Robin planned on
being a TV reporter.

351
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,448
I am a TV reporter.

352
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:40,291
I'm on every morning at 4:00 a.m.

353
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,706
Is that still on?

354
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:43,212
Good for you.

355
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,019
Somebody watch it, please.

356
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:47,591
Barney planned on being a violinist.

357
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:49,927
Don't tell me things.

358
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:54,155
You can't design your life
like a building.

359
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,160
It doesn't work that way.

360
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:59,186
You just have to live it,
and it will design itself.

361
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:01,439
So, what, I should just do nothing?

362
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,198
Listen to what the world
is telling you to do

363
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:06,527
and take the leap.

364
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:15,869
You're right.

365
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,089
You're absolutely right.

366
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,136
I love you, Lily.

367
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:24,378
Metaphorical leap.

368
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,317
Metaphorical leap!

369
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,342
- Not cool.
- Don't do it.

370
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,467
Not cool.

371
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:40,728
- I did it!
- Baby, you did it.

372
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:43,313
- I can do anything!
- Yes, you can.

373
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,940
I'm getting a motorcycle!

374
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:46,525
You absolutely are not!

375
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:48,611
Okay, sorry. Guys, come on over.

376
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:27,441
<i>That was the year
I got left at the altar.</i>

377
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:31,368
<i>It was the year I got knocked out
by a crazy bartender.</i>

378
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,280
<i>The year I got fired.</i>

379
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:36,116
<i>The year I got beat up by a goat.</i>

380
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:38,038
<i>A girl goat, at that.</i>

381
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,996
<i>And damn it if it wasn't
the best year of my life.</i>

382
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:48,667
<i>Because, if any one of those things
hadn't happened,</i>

383
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:52,490
<i>I never would have ended up and turned
out to be the best job I ever had.</i>

384
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,216
<i>But more importantly,</i>

385
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,282
<i>I wouldn't have met your mother,</i>

386
00:20:58,117 --> 00:20:59,767
<i>because, as you know</i>

387
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:01,718
<i>she was in that class.</i>

388
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:05,593
<i>Of course, that story
is only just beginning.</i>
