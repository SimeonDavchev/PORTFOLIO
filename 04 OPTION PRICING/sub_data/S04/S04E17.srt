1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,839
In March of 2009, I'd been dating my high
school girlfriend Karen for a few weeks.

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,813
My friends couldn't have
been happier about it.

3
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:10,419
- Hey, everybody.
- Hello.

4
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,273
Sorry, we, uh, we can't stay long.

5
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:14,699
- What a shame!
- That is sad!

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,453
Hey, are those real diamond earrings?

7
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,609
Yes. Yes, they are. Thank you.

8
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:22,003
I didn't say I liked them.

9
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:24,393
Oh, well, I got a great deal on them, so...

10
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:28,109
Cool. I'm sure all the exploited diamond miners
in Sierra Leone would give you a high-five

11
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:31,973
if they still had all their
fingers. But really pretty.

12
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:34,149
Meet me upstairs.

13
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:36,469
They only need one finger to
give her what I'm thinking.

14
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:39,513
Yeah. Ted, Karen's a douche.

15
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:41,509
Thanks for sugarcoating it.

16
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:43,299
"Douche" is sugarcoating it.

17
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:47,493
Uh, okay, believe it or not, my friends
do not get a vote on who I date.

18
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:49,469
It's my life. I call the shots.

19
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:51,863
- Ted, now!
- Yeah, coming!

20
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:56,719
I don't know what Ted sees
in that horrible woman.

21
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:59,293
I mean, yeah, she's got boobs, but

22
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:00,949
well, I guess I get it.

23
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:03,013
I think it's 'cause
they met in high school.

24
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,013
She was his first real girlfriend.

25
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:06,959
We look at Karen and see a jerk.

26
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,423
Ted looks at Karen and sees the first
person to touch his wiener besides himself,

27
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:12,393
his mom, and his pediatrician.

28
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:14,869
Okay, well, it's almost 2:00 A.M.
I better get ready for work.

29
00:01:14,893 --> 00:01:18,253
How can they call that thing
you're on a "morning show"?

30
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:20,833
4:00 A.M.is still the
middle of the night.

31
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:22,283
I don't see how you do it.

32
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:25,129
It's been almost a
month. I'm used to it.

33
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:27,053
Plus the show's not half bad, right?

34
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,393
- Totally.
- I've never seen it.

35
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:31,323
Have you guys ever watched it?

36
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:33,179
- Of course!
- I've never seen it.

37
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:34,909
Really? What is your favorite segment?

38
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,179
- Weather.
- I've never seen it.

39
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:38,089
- You guys have never seen my show.
- Sorry.

40
00:01:38,113 --> 00:01:40,053
- It's true.
- That's what I've been saying.

41
00:01:40,693 --> 00:01:45,273
Okay, yes, it's dull and generic and we get
spanked in the ratings by that Korean channel

42
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,063
that only shows Kim
Jong Il riding a horse,

43
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:53,953
but guys, it would mean so much to me if just
once I knew my friends were out there watching.

44
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,613
I'll tell you what.

45
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:59,893
This Friday morning, everyone
can come to our place 3:30 A.M.

46
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:02,759
We'll all put on PJs.
We'll watch Robin's show.

47
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:05,133
Aw, you guys are the best.

48
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:06,543
We just want to support you.

49
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:09,823
I just want to go to sleep!

50
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,793
I hate Robin for not
being more successful.

51
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,393
Hey, guys.

52
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:20,683
Sad announcement:
Karen broke up with me.

53
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:23,793
Go ahead.

54
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:26,643
I knew you were listening! Yes!

55
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:44,589
Hey, hey, we shouldn't be celebrating.

56
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:47,429
Ted's just been through a bad breakup.

57
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:50,079
Look, buddy, tell us everything.
Tell us what happened.

58
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,289
Seriously, spare no details.

59
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:56,253
What did she say? What did
you say? How did it feel?

60
00:02:56,703 --> 00:03:00,943
If you were to do it again,
all over, would you maybe...

61
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:04,143
How did it happen?

62
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:05,443
It was the stupidest thing.

63
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:09,659
I mean, we were just hanging
out, you know, being funny...

64
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:12,089
You're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

65
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:15,863
Ew, no, you're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

66
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,903
Wait. What is this?

67
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:22,299
Looks like one of Robin's
earrings. That's weird.

68
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:24,909
- You're the fan...
- How did it get in your bed?

69
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,473
I don't know.

70
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:28,139
Have you been sleeping with Robin?

71
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,729
What? No, of course not!

72
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:32,363
It, it probably got mixed in
with the laundry or something.

73
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:33,823
Why should I believe you?

74
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:36,779
Um, maybe because I've
alwaysbeen faithful to you

75
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:39,903
while you've cheated on
me, like, six times, bitch.

76
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:41,569
- Oh, snap!
- Cold-blooded!

77
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:43,789
Right? Right?

78
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:46,069
I totally should have said that.

79
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,463
Why should I believe you?

80
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:52,663
Um, maybe because I'vealwaysbeen
faithful to you while you...

81
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,529
I love you...

82
00:03:56,553 --> 00:04:00,923
I knew this was a mistake.
That's it. It's over.

83
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:05,019
And that was it. She left.

84
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:06,313
What a story.

85
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:08,873
So brave of you to share that.

86
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:11,739
Wait. Thoseare your pajamas?

87
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:13,773
You sleep in a pajama suit?

88
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:16,199
Of course. What do you think I sleep in?

89
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,963
A coffin.

90
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:20,703
Dude, that doesn't look
comfortable at all.

91
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:22,083
You're wearing a tie.

92
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:25,059
First of all, it's a sleeping cravat.

93
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,413
Second, it's not about comfort.

94
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:29,959
It's about looking good all the time.

95
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,103
Why do you have to
look good all the time?

96
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:36,263
Marshall, let me tell you a little story about
something that happened a couple months back.

97
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:50,479
We were just having a "Who's hornier" contest
and we spilled massage oil all over ourselves.

98
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:51,679
Nice pajamas.

99
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:53,803
Can we use your shower?

100
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:58,649
That's not a memory.
That's from a porn movie.

101
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,193
Not just any movie. That's
the exact scene from...

102
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:04,359
Never mind.

103
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,693
The point is itcouldhappen.

104
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:12,203
And if it did, and I didn't look my absolute best
for those greasy sluts, I'd regret it forever.

105
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:17,959
I'm sorry, dude, but that is just the most
ridiculous sleeping attire I've ever seen in my life.

106
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:20,029
Anyway...

107
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,639
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!

108
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:26,449
Hey, guys, you know how in the future we're always
saying "Remember when Marshall wore a nightgown"?

109
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:27,893
This is that time!

110
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,939
It's a nightshirt.

111
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:32,283
You can call it a Ninja
Star Danger Jock if you want.

112
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:34,059
Doesn't make you any
less of a cross-dresser.

113
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,733
Whatever, dude. It's comfy.

114
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:39,219
So, flying to Neverland with
Peter and Tink, was that amazing?

115
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:40,683
Ooh, let me go next!

116
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:45,103
Was it nice to finally get out of that crowded
bed and take Charlie to the chocolate factory?

117
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:46,813
Ooh, me, me, me, me!

118
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:49,623
Um, something about Scrooge!

119
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,323
Come on, guys. I'm carrying the team.

120
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:55,269
I don't know. I lived
with Marshall for 12 years.

121
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:58,603
Any time he's wearing
clothes at all, it's a victory.

122
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:02,463
Ted, show's about to start!

123
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:04,483
Be right there!

124
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:20,683
Good morning, New York. I'm Robin...

125
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:25,329
Marshall, I just found Robin's
earring on your dresser.

126
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:27,699
Did you have something to do with
the other one being in my bed?

127
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:28,603
What are you talking about?

128
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:31,799
You've always hated Karen. You've
been telling me to break up with her.

129
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:35,459
You did it. You-you put the earring
in my bed so that Karen would find it.

130
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:36,649
No, Ted, No! I would never...

131
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:38,489
- Admit it!
- There's nothing to admit!

132
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:40,249
Then why was Robin's
earring on your dresser?

133
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:42,149
He was accessorizing!

134
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:45,013
Marshall, I swear to God, if you
don't tell me the truth right now...

135
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:48,733
Wait! Marshall didn't do it.

136
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:50,993
I did.

137
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,403
I broke you and Karen up.

138
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:02,488
You broke me and Karen
up? Are you insane?

139
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:03,908
What gives you the right to do that?

140
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:06,032
Ted, I did it for your own good.

141
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:09,342
You just weren't seeing
how awful she was.

142
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:11,622
She failed the Front Porch Test.

143
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:13,788
What's the Front Porch Test?

144
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:17,702
Ted, you, me, and Marshall have
been best friends since college.

145
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:20,832
Think about how much we
all mean to each other.

146
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:24,498
So when I picture the future,
I picture us all together.

147
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:28,768
How we'll all be retired, sipping tea
on the front porch of our beach house,

148
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,612
playing bridge all day.

149
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:33,142
Okay, bridges are wild.

150
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:35,792
Four of a bridge beats a royal bridge.

151
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,622
I see your bridge and I
raise you three bridges.

152
00:07:39,662 --> 00:07:41,892
Bridge! I win!

153
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:44,392
You have no idea how
to play bridge, do you?

154
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,532
We're gonna take a class.

155
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:47,872
It's important to stay active.

156
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:53,012
So whenever you've been dating somebody
for a while, I do the Front Porch Test.

157
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:57,118
You know, how is this person gonna
fit in with our group over the years?

158
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,552
And when I think about Karen there...

159
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,798
Bridge! I win!

160
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:04,228
Fantastic. Another game of bridge.

161
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:06,532
Don't read a book or anything.

162
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:09,618
Look, dear... dolphins.

163
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:11,022
They seem happy.

164
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:16,178
I guess the chemical runoff from this elitist beachfront
property hasn't rotted out their blowholes yet.

165
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:18,928
It will. That water will kill you.

166
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:21,452
It is a toxic deathtrap.

167
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:22,852
I'm gonna take a dip.

168
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:24,748
I'll join you.

169
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:27,918
Karen failed the Front
Porch Test. She had to go.

170
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,252
I can't believe you did that.

171
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:33,612
Ted, think about how awesome
you, me, and Marshall are.

172
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:36,442
Seriously think about it.

173
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:42,308
- We're pretty awesome.
- We're totally awesome!

174
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:46,658
So whoever you marry,
whoever joins Team Awesome,

175
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:49,512
the bar is set pretty damn high.

176
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:52,788
Look, I'm not saying what
I did was right, but...

177
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:54,112
You're better off without her.

178
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,932
And if Clarence the angel
says it's true, it must be true.

179
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:59,418
Okay, you know what?
Fine, make your little jokes.

180
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,108
Seriously, why would you
wear something like that?

181
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:03,848
- Lots of reasons.
- I bet you can't name five.

182
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:05,932
One: No need to wear
anything underneath.

183
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:08,108
I can vouch for that. Will
you cross your legs, buddy?

184
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:10,018
Two: Sexy.

185
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,248
I can vouch for that.

186
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:13,332
Will you uncross your legs, buddy?

187
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:17,682
Three: My Grandpa Olaf wore
one and he lived to be 107.

188
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:22,812
Four: No elastic waistband leaving its judgmental
pink teeth marks around my Thanksgiving belly.

189
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:28,258
And five: Every night when I
go to sleep, it's the freest,

190
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:30,362
most wonderful feeling in the world.

191
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:33,812
I feel... like I'm flying.

192
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:43,242
So that's how I go to bed
every night: Happy, weightless.

193
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,002
With a heart full of
joy. What about you?

194
00:09:47,222 --> 00:09:51,542
I have to lie perfectly still
so I don't wrinkle my suit-jamas.

195
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:54,732
But at least I'm not wearing a dress.

196
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:58,528
So... how mad are you?

197
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:00,338
I don't know. I mean,

198
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:05,178
I guess if you guys feel that strongly
about Karen, then maybe it was for the best.

199
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:06,782
I really am sorry.

200
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:10,342
I hated doing that again,
but Karen had to go.

201
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:15,838
"Again"? Wait. How many times have
you broken me up with a girlfriend?

202
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,748
Never! Six.

203
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:20,642
- Like who?
- No one! Angie.

204
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:23,342
Sophomore year.

205
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:27,702
She was just using you to get back at
her ex, and you clearly didn't see it,

206
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:31,722
so one day when she was taking a nap...

207
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,772
Creed?

208
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,592
Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.

209
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:55,412
So that's where my Creed CD went.

210
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:57,172
Who else?

211
00:10:57,212 --> 00:11:02,378
Remember that weird sci-fi girl who wanted
you to propose after, like, two months?

212
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:06,652
You barely even liked her, but you
were still thinking about it, so...

213
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:13,448
Listen, Ted, you're great,
and this is so difficult,

214
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,328
but I think we're looking
for different things.

215
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:20,682
So, live long and prosper. Or whatever.

216
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,748
That was you? This is insane!

217
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,038
Ted, I did those things to help you.

218
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:33,092
You're a commitment junkie.

219
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:36,552
You fall in love with these women,
even if they don't deserve you.

220
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:39,198
What if one of those women was supposed
to be the mother of my children?

221
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:43,092
If there was ever the tiniest chance
of that, I swear I didn't do anything.

222
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:45,472
Like with Victoria or Stella.

223
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,482
Or Robin.

224
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,162
Or Robin.

225
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,298
Robin, Robin.

226
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:54,652
Did you break us up, too?

227
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,012
Did you break us up, too?

228
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,898
Stop talking to me like I'm your enemy!

229
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:04,862
You weep for these women, but you have
the luxury of not knowing what I know:

230
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:08,838
That those breakups, while tragic,
probably saved you from a crappy

231
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,858
and very expensive first marriage.

232
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:12,922
Did you break me and Robin up?

233
00:12:12,962 --> 00:12:17,572
You don't want the truth because deep down,
you want me out there watching out for you.

234
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:22,492
And deep down, you know that none of those women
were ever gonna be the mother of your children.

235
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,908
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- I did what I had to do.

236
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:28,532
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- You're damn right I did!

237
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:37,252
Marshall, your grandpa
Olaf was a wise man.

238
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,619
You broke me and Robin up?

239
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,355
- No, it's not...
- I cannot believe this.

240
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,415
I need another drink.

241
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,705
You know, I feel a little
breeze down there. It's nice.

242
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,195
Oh, you think that's something?

243
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:56,039
Stand over this heating vent. It's
like your junk is on a tropical island.

244
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,145
Little Barney says "Mahalo."

245
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,755
Seriously, what is wrong with you, Lily?

246
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:03,759
How could you do that?

247
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:06,009
I did this because I care about you!

248
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:09,435
I am so glad that is
the one you watched!

249
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:12,289
Dear God, what happened to you?

250
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:16,045
You didn't watch my show?

251
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:18,095
The show. Sorry.

252
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:20,599
Something special happen?

253
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,909
Same old, same old.

254
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:26,485
Lily just told us that
she broke you and me up.

255
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:29,635
What? Broke-broke us up?
What does that even mean?

256
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,575
And why are these guys
wearing nightgowns?

257
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,445
- Nightshirts.
- Nightshirts.

258
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,015
- It's a nightshirt.
- It's called a nightshirt, Robin.

259
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:38,765
Turns out Lily has taken it upon herself to
sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.

260
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:42,235
No. Robin was different. I
didn't want you two to break up,

261
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:47,389
but you wanted completely different things
out of life and refused to deal with it.

262
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,995
I could just picture that front porch.

263
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,929
Mm, two of hearts.

264
00:13:51,969 --> 00:13:57,439
Just like the hearts of the two children I
never had because my lovely wife hates kids.

265
00:13:57,969 --> 00:13:59,819
Mm, a deuce.

266
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:05,235
Exactly what my career dropped once I
decided to settle down and marry Ted.

267
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,689
Bridge! I win.

268
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:12,209
Well, I do not like
that scenario one bit.

269
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:16,259
All I tried to do was get you
guys to talk about your issues.

270
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:20,265
I didn't know I was feeding you the
words that would lead to your breakup.

271
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:23,609
Hey, here's a fun question, just for fun.

272
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:26,498
Where do you see yourself in five years?

273
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,569
You know what's fun? Fun questions.

274
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:32,785
Where do you see yourself in five years?

275
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,635
Where do you see yourself in five years?

276
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:36,335
Where do you see yourself?

277
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:40,859
Not to put words in your mouth,
but you probably want to be married.

278
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,565
I probably want to be married.

279
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:45,839
You probably want to
be in Tokyo or Paris.

280
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:49,265
I probably want to be in Argentina.

281
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,219
Argentina?

282
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:52,889
Or Tokyo or Paris.

283
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,899
We have an expiration date, don't we?

284
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:56,899
Oh, my God.

285
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,089
Lily, you can't manipulate
people like that!

286
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:04,309
I - I've known you 12 years, and I can honestly
say, I have never been more furious at you!

287
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:07,349
- Look, I didn't mean to... I was just...
- No! I don't even want to hear it!

288
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:10,255
Settle down! Let's just settle down!

289
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,669
Now, I have one question.

290
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,245
What do these bad boys feel like in bed?

291
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:16,079
Come on. Let's go see.

292
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:20,415
So, if it weren't for you, Ted
and I might still be dating?

293
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:23,279
Or you would have stayed
together far too long,

294
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:27,229
had an incredibly bitter breakup
and not even remained friends,

295
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,739
and then you and I would
never have become best friends.

296
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:33,655
Don't even say that. Okay?

297
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,229
Stop hugging!

298
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,499
Lily, you had no right to
interfere in my relationships.

299
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:40,565
You got lucky. Okay?

300
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,979
You met the love of your life in
a dorm hallway when you were 18.

301
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:45,735
But that doesn't give
you the right to play God

302
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,235
to the rest of us mortals down here
who are still looking for someone.

303
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:52,565
You're so concerned about who you and Marshall
are gonna end up on that front porch with.

304
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:54,359
Well, you know what?

305
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,929
You can have it to yourselves.

306
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:02,879
What happened to your jacket?

307
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:06,315
Oh, soot, bread crumbs, placenta.

308
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,369
Did you at least TiVo it?

309
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,025
So you're this comfy every night,
and Lily still has sex with you?

310
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,375
Yeah. That's what marriage is
all about, man, unconditional love.

311
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,099
You can wear whatever you
want and still get laid.

312
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,509
Tell me more about being married.

313
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:27,195
Well, sometimes, when you're married,

314
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,329
you wake up to the smell of
breakfast already on the table.

315
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,755
- And coffee, too?
- And coffee, too.

316
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,669
Sometimes, she'll even put out
a vase of freshly cut flowers.

317
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:40,449
I love flowers.

318
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,369
And sometimes, when you're worried you've
made all the wrong decisions in life

319
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:48,485
and you're not nearly the man you
want to be, what does she do then?

320
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:53,115
Well, she tells you that you're
great and it's all gonna be okay.

321
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,439
That's wonderful.

322
00:16:55,869 --> 00:17:00,009
And she'll help you find
other girls to have sex with?

323
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:04,199
I mean, I guess.

324
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:07,389
Maybe if you agreed upon
that beforehand, yeah.

325
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,559
Little guy had a big day.

326
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,245
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

327
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,569
Sweet dreams, slugger.

328
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,785
The next night, I was still
angry at your aunt Lily.

329
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,519
Until...

330
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,649
What are you...

331
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:43,175
Lily came by and explained everything.

332
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:46,109
And she gave me this note for you.

333
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:51,779
"Ted, I'm sorry.

334
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,199
"It doesn't matter to me who you marry.

335
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:58,059
"I know they'll be awesome
because they'll think you are.

336
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:02,649
"To show I mean it, I put together a little
surprise "for you and Karen upstairs.

337
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:03,999
Love, Lily."

338
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,779
"P.S.Sorry the envelope
was already open."

339
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,949
"I had to read what
she wrote. Marshall."

340
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:12,389
Sabotaging our relationship?

341
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:17,625
I got to say, even using the specially-ordered
extra-low bar by which I judge your friends,

342
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:19,819
Lily really outdid herself this time.

343
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,245
Obviously, we can't ever see her again.

344
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,229
I know. It's a big loss, right?

345
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:32,185
Hey, rember your old college roommate?

346
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:36,115
He was married to that
shrill little idiot girl.

347
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:40,125
Marshall. Oh, it's been so long.

348
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,425
God, I hated him.

349
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:44,939
Anyway, here's his obituary.

350
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:50,669
And I realized, maybe it shouldn't matter
what my friends think of my girlfriend,

351
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:54,729
but it sure as hell matters what
my girlfriend thinks of my friends.

352
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:57,859
- So you ended it?
- Yeah.

353
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:03,579
So if you want to be my plus
one, Lily's a damn good cook.

354
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:08,619
Beef pot pie, mac and cheese,
homemade buttermilk biscuits.

355
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:11,759
Well, no wonder Marshall dies at 68.

356
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,989
Thank you.

357
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,659
So, Robin and I enjoyed a gourmet dinner.

358
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,519
Well, for her it was breakfast.

359
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:23,275
And we ended up doing exactly what
Lily wanted us to do all along:

360
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,729
We talked about our relationship.

361
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:30,499
- So, Lily broke us up, sort of.
- Yeah.

362
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,229
- Kind of makes you wonder.
- Yeah.

363
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:39,209
I mean, if it weren't for her,
would we still be dating right now?

364
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,789
Maybe.

365
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:45,415
But Lily was right. We weren't ready.

366
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:48,319
We both need to move
on, do our own thing.

367
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,849
Still do, I guess.

368
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,339
We should make a pact.

369
00:19:55,389 --> 00:20:00,279
If the years go by, and we both
turn 40, and we're still single...

370
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:09,125
Robin Scherbatsky

371
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:12,309
will you be my backup wife?

372
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:14,659
A girl always dreams
of hearing those words.

373
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:18,289
Yes! Yes! A million times, yes!

374
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,539
- All right, it's a deal.
- Yeah.

375
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,899
So, should we set up some
ground rules for this?

376
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:31,649
Okay, like what?

377
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,645
I don't know. Like neither one of us
can get super fat. Stuff like that.

378
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:37,139
Okay, I only have one: You
can't wear a nightshirt.

379
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:40,609
- I will never wear a nightshirt.
- Thank God.

380
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:59,379
Never mind.

381
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:01,919
No!
