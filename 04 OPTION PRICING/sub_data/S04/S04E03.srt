1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:04,278
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2008,
I've had a little problem.</i>

2
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:06,764
All right, I got to get to Stella's.

3
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:10,388
Tonight's the night guys, I've tried it
before, I've failed every time.

4
00:00:10,412 --> 00:00:13,505
This time, I'm gonna do it.
Tonight...

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,045
I pick up a lesbian.

6
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:19,036
Robin,

7
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:20,600
I need your lipstick.

8
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:21,983
Oh, man!

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,479
Take pictures, all right?

10
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:25,579
Bye Ted.

11
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:28,977
<i>I lived in New York,</i>

12
00:00:29,972 --> 00:00:32,170
<i>but Stella lived accross the river</i>

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,452
<i>in New Jersey.</i>

14
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:36,233
Oh, man!

15
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:40,937
<i>Which meant,
I was always taking the train.</i>

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,148
What's up, Ted?

17
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:43,622
Hey Matisse.

18
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:47,449
Hey, T-diddy! You missed it!

19
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,198
Robin got that national anchor job!

20
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:50,876
And we got
a free bottle of champagne!

21
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:52,544
But it's empty now.

22
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,294
Oh, man!

23
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:57,847
<i>And as a result, it seamed like
I was missing out on everything.</i>

24
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:01,219
Sorry we couldn't wait.
It was getting cold.

25
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:02,507
Oh, man!

26
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,389
- Hey big guy!
- What's up, G?

27
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,503
Are you okay?

28
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:07,787
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just

29
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:09,638
you know I want to
hang out with you guys,

30
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:10,804
I want to hang out with my friends.

31
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:13,035
It just feel like I'm spending
all my time on the train.

32
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,098
Okay, how about this? Why don't you ask
your friends to come up here sometime?

33
00:01:17,198 --> 00:01:18,612
That's a great idea!

34
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:21,615
You want us to go to New Jersey?
Oh, that is rich.

35
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:22,729
Why?

36
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,545
Well, for starters, I don't have any
of my gold medaillons anymore.

37
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:29,865
I sold them when they went out
of style, 400 years ago.

38
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:32,814
- Lily?
- Oh, sorry, Ted.

39
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:34,461
I'm a born and raised New Yorker.

40
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,560
I'm programmed to despise and loathe.

41
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,635
New Jersey and
all that it stands for.

42
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:40,090
Why am I telling you this?

43
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,893
You hate New Jersey
more than anyone.

44
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:44,729
What? I don't hate New Jersey!
Why would you think that?

45
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,194
And then he cut in front of me!
God, I hate line cutters

46
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:50,310
more than I hate... New Jersey.

47
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:52,052
Well that's not true,

48
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:54,647
there's nothing I hate more
than New Jersey.

49
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:00,917
Nice?

50
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:04,441
Hey, you want us to wait for you?

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,403
No, it might be awhile,
I got a drop a massive New Jersey.

52
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,859
Okay, so New Jersey's
not my favourite place

53
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,369
but once Stella
and I get married,

54
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:14,967
and she and Lucy
move in with me,

55
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:17,174
I'll never set foot
in New Jersey again.

56
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:19,014
Unless I'm going to see
a Giants game or,

57
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:20,638
flying down at Newark, or,

58
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,884
God forbid, disposing of a body.

59
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:26,093
Ted, if you murder me,
and bury me in New Jersey

60
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:28,046
I'll haunt you for ever.

61
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:30,458
But if I murder you and
bury you in somewhere else?

62
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,832
I'll leave you alone.
I'm sure you had your reasons.

63
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,989
<i>Kids, your aunt Robin was sick
of her job in Metro News One.</i>

64
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,005
<i>She was sick
of the low production value.</i>

65
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,653
I'm Robin Scherbatsky
and your watching...

66
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:01,367
Etro News One at 11:00,

67
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:04,872
and again at 1:00.

68
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:07,821
<i>Sick of the stories
she had to report...</i>

69
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:09,957
So hurry up and get your votes in,

70
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:12,560
for New York's cutest doggie.

71
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:14,801
<i>And most of all,</i>

72
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:16,730
<i>she was sick of all
the stupids puns.</i>

73
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:18,761
Four transit workers
were electrocuted

74
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,912
when a subway train
jumped the tracks.

75
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:22,545
Stay tuned for the

76
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:24,727
shocking derails.

77
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:26,991
Joel, people died.

78
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:30,146
<i>So when the call came in</i>

79
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:32,117
<i>that she got
the big national anchor job,</i>

80
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:33,796
<i>she finally got to say the words</i>

81
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,633
<i>she'd been dreaming of saying
for years...</i>

82
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:37,874
<i>Tonight will be my last broadcast.</i>

83
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:41,088
<i>I came to Metro News One as a
little caterpillar,</i>

84
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:42,704
<i>and for four years,</i>

85
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:45,331
<i>this desk has been my cocoon,</i>

86
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,522
<i>but tonight, I emerge,</i>

87
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,657
<i>an ambitious butterfly.</i>

88
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:53,292
Why does she sound like an idiot?
Did she have a stroke?

89
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:55,755
Yeah, a stroke of genius.

90
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:58,015
This speech is really good.

91
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,288
<i>With one eye on the horizon,</i>

92
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,306
<i>one eye on the truth,</i>

93
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,355
<i>and one eye, on all of you.</i>

94
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,320
You wrote it for her,
didn't you?

95
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,642
It's a modified version of the

96
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,753
speech I gave when I had to leave
the swim team because

97
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:15,408
of the chronic inner ear situation.

98
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:16,963
I thought you were the towel-boy.

99
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:18,606
It's part of the team!

100
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:20,201
<i>So that saturday,</i>

101
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:22,606
<i>as Robin went off for her first day
at her new job,</i>

102
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:23,990
<i>we're all headed accross the river</i>

103
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,770
<i>to experience some of
that crazy New Jersey night life.</i>

104
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:30,435
Okay, Stella couldn't find a sitter,
so we can't go out. Instead,

105
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:32,676
we're all gonna hang out here,

106
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,177
and it's gonna be just as awesome.

107
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:36,617
Right? We got board games,
we got movies,

108
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:39,734
and I think there may be some beer,
out in the garage.

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,133
Ted, this is pathetic!

110
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,869
It's saturday night,
we should be out at the bar,

111
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:46,737
drinking alcohol!

112
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:48,999
Now, I know this sounds depressing,
bordering on tragic,

113
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,023
but it's just a fact.

114
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,636
Yeah, and I want another crack
at that chick, Doris.

115
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:54,677
I know I can land that lesbian plane.

116
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:56,026
No snakes on that plan.

117
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,735
Okay, guys, come on,
you promised.

118
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,225
Let's just hang out here,

119
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:03,926
try to have fun. I mean,

120
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,181
we're all together.

121
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:08,125
Friends hanging out,
isn't that would really matters?

122
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:13,973
Okay, if we take the next train,

123
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,419
we could be at MacLaren's by 11:00!

124
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:16,236
We can be there by 10:00?

125
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:17,386
No, I have to change first,

126
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,314
I'm not walking into MacLaren's
smelling like New Jersey.

127
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:26,602
You guys really hate it here?

128
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,811
- What?
- No! Stells.

129
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,442
No, no, I get it, I mean
you guys are all New Yorkers,

130
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:33,747
you need to hang out at a bar.

131
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,682
Well, you could,

132
00:05:34,764 --> 00:05:36,594
just hang out
on the coolest bar in state,

133
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:39,151
which is so close it
will blow your mind.

134
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:42,917
And boom goes the dynamite.

135
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:45,239
The coolest bar in New Jersey.

136
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:46,964
Yeah, it probably is...

137
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:48,671
This is great!

138
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,395
We got darts,

139
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,448
half a ping-pong table,

140
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:53,914
a fish bowl,

141
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,941
look what turned out to be
an awesome night as promised.

142
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:59,600
Maybe we can drop some bac-o's
in here, and make them fight.

143
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,910
No thanks.
I don't mess with fish bowls unless

144
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,705
they have my two favorite fish.

145
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,127
The sucker fish

146
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,611
and the blow fish. What up?

147
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:09,954
For blow fish?

148
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:11,248
I don't think so.

149
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:14,954
- Marshall?
- You're better than that.

150
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:16,613
Lily?

151
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:17,713
Not good enough.

152
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:20,370
Stella?

153
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:23,598
Sorry.

154
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:26,068
I am not lowering this,

155
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:28,249
until someone gives me the respect

156
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:30,302
of another person's knuckles

157
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:31,663
tapping against mine

158
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,939
in a light but decisive manner.

159
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:36,692
Pretty-pretty...

160
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:37,880
Pretty-pretty...

161
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,539
Pretty-pret...
who's a pretty baby?

162
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:42,545
Then know this,

163
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:45,331
until it gets what it wants, nay,

164
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,563
deserves,

165
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:48,451
this fist,

166
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:50,269
will not yield.

167
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:52,275
It

168
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:53,492
will

169
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:54,693
not

170
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:56,012
yield.

171
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:58,353
So who wants to play Scrabble?

172
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,535
Sure. Whatever.

173
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:00,789
Oh, heads up.

174
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:03,406
The X tile is a little hard to read
because, a couple years ago,

175
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:05,365
it went all the way
through my dog.

176
00:07:07,148 --> 00:07:09,090
You konw, maybe
we should get a dog again,

177
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:10,236
When you move in.

178
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,690
When I what?

179
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,893
Oh great, there's Robin.

180
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,967
I thought they were moving in
with you.

181
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:23,433
So did I.

182
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:27,902
Oh God, am I moving
to New Jersey?

183
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:29,593
Hey guys,

184
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:30,585
I bet that dog was really

185
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:33,764
flying high
after it swallow the little X.

186
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,488
Nailed it!

187
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,233
Come on!

188
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:44,324
I can't live here.

189
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:45,649
It wouldn't be that bad.

190
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,807
You could put a mini-fridge over there

191
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,074
and maybe some knock hockey.

192
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:51,373
Knock hockey. Nice one, big mon.

193
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:55,260
Yeah, I meant New Jersey
in general, not this basement.

194
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:56,808
She wants me to move here?

195
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,319
I don't get it.
We discussed this months ago.

196
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:02,310
So, I was thinking,
after the wedding,

197
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:04,771
you and Lucy, can move in here.

198
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,748
Yeah, she could play out
on the fire escape,

199
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,296
maybe make friends with that guy

200
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,903
who sleeps on that couch in the alley,

201
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:13,532
ride her bike up and down Broadway.

202
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:15,960
It's a great idea, Ted.

203
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:19,620
I don't understand

204
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:21,141
why you'd want to live in New Jersey

205
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,885
when you have a chance
to live in Manhattan?

206
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,678
I thought having
a rent-controlled apartment

207
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:26,985
on the Upper West Side was half
the reason she agreed to marry me.

208
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,240
Really, I thought it was
the whole reason.

209
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:29,284
What is up?!

210
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:32,322
- Hey.
- Robin, hey.

211
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:33,929
You're looking good.

212
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:35,404
Bump the Barnacle.

213
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,093
Stella already told me not to.

214
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:38,445
How was your first day?

215
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:39,287
It wasn't.

216
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:41,222
- What?
- It wasn't my first day.

217
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:43,451
I showed up
and there were 20 other people.

218
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:45,327
It turns out,
I didn't actually get the job.

219
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:46,896
I only got an audition.

220
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:48,094
What, how did that happen?

221
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:50,181
I don't know.
Because he told me that I got it.

222
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:51,744
I got it?

223
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
I got it!

224
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:55,973
<i>And just to be clear,
when I say you got it</i>

225
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,049
<i>I mean an audition.</i>

226
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,383
<i>You got an audition.</i>

227
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,614
<i>I don't want there to be any confusion.
You have an audition</i>

228
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,177
<i>only.</i>

229
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:06,435
<i>Not the job.</i>

230
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,303
Thank you. Thank you!

231
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:12,872
Okay, I'm going to call and beg
Joel to give me my job back.

232
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:15,027
You hated that job.

233
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,552
I don't know, it wasn't so bad.

234
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:17,994
Robin, what did they make you call.

235
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:20,927
Tropical Storm Hector
when it was raining cats and dogs?

236
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:22,643
A furricane.

237
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,398
Hey, Ted.

238
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:26,417
Rock me like a furricane.

239
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:27,591
Thanks.

240
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,467
Mean.

241
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,074
Okay, yeah, it's sucks,

242
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,069
but what can I do?

243
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,836
I mean, I'm not going
to get that other job.

244
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:36,055
You guys should have seen
the other women at this audition.

245
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,905
They all had more experience than me,

246
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:39,277
were more ethnic than me.

247
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:41,072
There was an African-American chick

248
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:41,917
with blue eyes,

249
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,547
how can I compete with that?

250
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,216
You can't.

251
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,205
No, you can compete with anyone.

252
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,883
You're Robin Scherbatsky.

253
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,164
Confident. Strong. Tall.

254
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:53,632
With crazy long legs
that look great in shorts.

255
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,202
I'm calling Joel.

256
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:57,630
But, no Robin,
if you call him right now,

257
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,768
you will hate yourself.

258
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:01,137
Look, I have slept with lots of women

259
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:03,460
who afterwards told me off
and stormed out.

260
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,633
And sometimes
they'd pick up the phone

261
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:06,763
and they'd call me

262
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:08,179
and then we'd hook up again.

263
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,346
And when we were finished,
I could see that look on their faces,

264
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,926
that look that says
they hate themselves

265
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,557
and they wish they'd never called.

266
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:17,762
But if you could see

267
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,733
that look,
actually, you can see that look,

268
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:21,481
there's a video. Www

269
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,909
- dot...
- No! Stop, okay? I won't call.

270
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:25,894
Don't drink the beer!

271
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:27,323
I just remembered when I bought it.

272
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,137
It was right before
I got pregnant with Lucy.

273
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,700
Ted, would you mind running
to PriceCo and picking some up?

274
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:32,800
Oh, and while you're there,

275
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:34,251
maybe you could sign up for a card.
I mean,

276
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,155
you'll probably end up
going there all the time.

277
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:40,371
That's the look.

278
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:45,776
I can't move here.
I hate it here.

279
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,796
I would kill myself.

280
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,060
Maybe New Jersey is not that bad.

281
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,385
Stella has a lawn.

282
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,081
You could get a riding lawn mower.

283
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:53,165
They sell them over there.

284
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:54,736
I saw one with a cup holder.

285
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:57,232
I saw a recliner
with a built-in cup holder.

286
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:58,988
I even saw a hammock
with a cup holder.

287
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,850
You live in New Jersey,

288
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,350
you never have to hold a cup again.

289
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:04,105
I don't think I have as big a problem
holding cups as you do.

290
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,599
I will give you $100
to fist pump me.

291
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:11,655
$200.

292
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:13,813
Just put it down, Barney.

293
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:15,662
Your arm must be killing you by now.

294
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:19,564
$10,000.

295
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:23,605
Look, you'll be right across the river.
You'll be in New York all the time.

296
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:24,629
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

297
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,517
Excuse me.

298
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:28,027
You guys are from New York, right?

299
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,411
Yeah, we moved here
from Manhattan.

300
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,919
Do you ever get into the city?

301
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:32,088
All the time.

302
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:33,220
See? All the time.

303
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:34,790
When was the last time you were there?

304
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:36,580
We just had dinner at O'Rourke's.

305
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:38,279
That's been closed for six years.

306
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,146
It has been awhile.

307
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:41,597
Funny, we don't miss it.

308
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,912
Well, I guess we're
New Jersians now.

309
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,029
Honey, look, dog shirts.

310
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:50,520
I can't do it.
I'm just going to tell Stella

311
00:11:50,637 --> 00:11:52,837
she and Lucy have to move into the city
and that's that.

312
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:54,692
Okay, what do you guys think?

313
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,562
Beagle or Boston terrier?

314
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,092
Are those tears?

315
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:05,792
They're awesome

316
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:08,421
manly pain tears.
They're not emotional.

317
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:11,952
Okay, they're a little bit emotional.

318
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,994
Where's Robin?

319
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,006
Hey, Shirley,
it's Robin calling for Joel.

320
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:23,306
Robin, hang up the phone.
Don't do this.

321
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:24,696
Sorry, I know, okay?

322
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:26,846
If you don't hang up right now...

323
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,477
Hey, Joel, it's Robin.

324
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:32,435
So Madam Butterfly
wants to come back to the cocoon.

325
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,439
Yeah, look, I'm sorry
I said all that stuff.

326
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:37,698
Well, you can stick your sorries
in your sock drawer,

327
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,190
'cause you've already been replaced.

328
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:42,576
I've got Brian in make up
and he couldn't be more excited.

329
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:45,227
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

330
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,175
Okay, look, as much
as I want to see college boy

331
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:49,902
here wet himself on camera,

332
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:52,104
if you can get here in time
to read the 11:00 news,

333
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:53,487
you can have your old job back.

334
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:57,205
Okay, I have a half hour
to make it to the studio.

335
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,592
There's no way you can make it
to the city in a half hour.

336
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:00,658
Robin, don't do this.

337
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,245
I know it's scary to bet on yourself,

338
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,957
but if you don't, nobody else will.

339
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:05,839
And I'm not just saying that
to get a fist bump.

340
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:07,220
Although, come on,
a fist bump would be great.

341
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,276
But I really mean it.

342
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,513
I am betting on myself.

343
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:12,163
I am betting that I can make it there
by 11 o'clock.

344
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:29,915
Hey, did you get the beer?

345
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,375
Yeah, I got 144-pack.

346
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:33,909
The rest is in the trunk.

347
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:35,992
And did you sign up
for the membership?

348
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:38,803
Why not?

349
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,045
There was a line for the photos

350
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,153
my hair's a mess...

351
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,018
I don't want to move to New Jersey.

352
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:44,814
What?

353
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:45,823
I can't do it.

354
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:47,452
And I can't see any reason

355
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,214
why you and Lucy
shouldn't move to New York.

356
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,367
Well, my daughter goes to school here.

357
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:52,609
All of her friends are here.

358
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:53,572
I've lived here my whole life.

359
00:13:53,662 --> 00:13:54,961
<i>My whole family is here.</i>

360
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:55,755
<i>This is my house.</i>

361
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:58,136
I'm on the PTA, and as of June 1,

362
00:13:58,323 --> 00:13:59,594
I'm the deputy mayor.

363
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:04,537
Yes, but my apartment
is really close to the subway.

364
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:08,933
Ted, we're not moving,
end of discussion.

365
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:10,457
How can it be end of discussion

366
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,003
if there's never been a discussion?

367
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:13,670
This is part of being a parent.

368
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:15,003
I can't just uproot Lucy.

369
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:17,513
People with kids move
all the time. And...

370
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,237
I think it would be really great
for Lucy

371
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:20,899
to grow up
in the greatest city in the world.

372
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:21,803
Here we go...

373
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,709
New York's the greatest city
in the whole wide world.

374
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:24,557
It's where dreams come true

375
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,173
and pigeon poop
tastes like tapioca.

376
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,992
Want to know a little secret, Ted?

377
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:30,973
New Jersey is better than New York.

378
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:32,562
Better than...?

379
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:33,999
You think...? I...

380
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,516
The Empire State Buil...

381
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,042
H and H Bage...

382
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:39,807
Lincoln Ce...

383
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,990
Zabar's...

384
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:42,901
Papaya King.

385
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:44,710
New York is the intellectual

386
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,335
and cultural hub of the planet.

387
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:50,344
New York is full of weirdoes,
and snobs and mean people.

388
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:51,898
Ted, do you know that once,
an old lady

389
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:54,403
actually called me a bitch
and threw a cat in my face?

390
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,760
And you want to know
if that happened in New Jersey?

391
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:58,333
86th and Lex,

392
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:00,395
right in front of your beloved
little Papaya King.

393
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:03,319
People are nice in New Jersey.

394
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,642
I mean it's the kind of place
where you know your neighbors.

395
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,903
- Hey, I know my neighbors.
- Oh, yeah? Like who?

396
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:10,605
Right across the hall, I got...

397
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,900
Clax... pa... mon...

398
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:15,097
- Claxpamon?
- His name is Paxton.

399
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,675
Love that dude.

400
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,764
Sorry, in a hurry.
Got to get to the front.

401
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,900
Got to get off first.

402
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:22,593
Don't run over Matisse.

403
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:24,771
Okay, so this is crazy.

404
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:26,198
You can't actually think

405
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,593
that New Jersey
is better than New York.

406
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:31,325
New York has Broadway.
We win right there.

407
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:33,245
Oh, no, she did not.

408
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,860
Knuckle up for safety.

409
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:36,461
We have Atlantic City.

410
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:37,733
Can't beat the A.C.

411
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,395
Pretty please?
No one has to know.

412
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:41,493
New York has Greenwich Village.

413
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,901
New Jersey has The Shore.

414
00:15:42,986 --> 00:15:44,047
Woody Allen.

415
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:46,974
Oscar-winning chronicler
of urban neuroses.

416
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,035
Bump it!

417
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:50,214
- Bruce Springsteen.
- Sinatra.

418
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,613
He's from Hoboken...

419
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,672
- New Jersey.
- Yeah, but what city is

420
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:54,581
he singing about?

421
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:56,903
It's not "Secaucus, Secaucus."

422
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:02,869
Come on...

423
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:06,906
<i>Now you kids
can either believe this or not,</i>

424
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:10,147
<i>but this is how your
Aunt Robin swears it happened.</i>

425
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:18,036
Look, Stella,

426
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:20,133
I understand that coming
from New Jersey

427
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:22,573
you don't picture yourself
loving New York,

428
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,350
but trust me,
Marshall didn't expect to,

429
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,800
and now he wouldn't think
of living anywhere else.

430
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,233
I hate New York!

431
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:31,932
I'm sorry, but it's true.

432
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:34,140
Okay, today I was walking
around PriceCo.

433
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:36,028
Have you ever been there?
It's huge.

434
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,741
All the stores in New York
are so cramped.

435
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,539
Every time I turn,
I knock something over.

436
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:41,785
I'm like some huge monster
that came out of the ocean

437
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:43,081
to destroy bodegas.

438
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:44,903
But, Marshall, you love New York.

439
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:46,978
Yeah, I do, except that I hate it.

440
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:50,003
I'm too big for New York, okay?

441
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:52,547
I'm always trying to fit
into cramped little subway seats

442
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,087
or duck under doorways
that were built 150 years ago.

443
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:57,010
Hey, guess what?
People are bigger now.

444
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:59,239
Build bigger doorways.
What the hell is the matter with you?

445
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,672
Small city, big man...
give it up.

446
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:03,928
And it's so loud, all the time.

447
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,369
Yes, it's the city that never sleeps.

448
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:07,430
Well, guess what, I like to sleep.

449
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:09,685
I've been tired for eight years.

450
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,521
Tired and scared with black
and blue marks on my elbows

451
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,953
from trying to fit through
all these tiny elf doorways.

452
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:16,652
New Jersey's great.

453
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,154
It's got huge stores,

454
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:21,108
and lawns and you never have
to carry a cup again.

455
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:23,203
Not for the rest of your life.

456
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:25,333
I'm not afraid to say it...

457
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,389
I love New Jersey.

458
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,279
I'm just kidding.

459
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,392
Look, Stella...

460
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,533
I get it, okay?

461
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:39,533
I see what you're saying.

462
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:41,512
I guess

463
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,003
we could live in Brooklyn.

464
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:48,403
You know what, Ted

465
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:50,094
live wherever you want.

466
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:51,255
I don't care.

467
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:01,403
Awkward silence. Tap it.

468
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:16,074
Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?

469
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:18,223
There was some loud noises
in the basement.

470
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:19,923
Sorry about that.

471
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,567
Why don't you got back to bed, sweetie.

472
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,173
I can't go to sleep without a story.

473
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,903
- Okay, I'll just get your mom...
- Why don't you read it to me?

474
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:30,990
Okay, come on.

475
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:01,679
I'm moving here.

476
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:04,869
Really?

477
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,344
Really.

478
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:08,633
New Jersey wins.

479
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:30,313
Thank you!

480
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:32,938
Wait...

481
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,342
Good evening, New York.

482
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:47,661
Hey, look, she made it.

483
00:19:47,783 --> 00:19:49,070
Our top story tonight

484
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:50,938
the newborn panda
at the Central Park Zoo

485
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,610
got its first tooth today.

486
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,591
I guess that makes her a

487
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:56,867
molar bear.

488
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,496
Molar bear.

489
00:20:00,773 --> 00:20:01,773
Molar bear.

490
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:06,333
You know what? I really am done.

491
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:08,194
Good night, New York.

492
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:14,973
She really quit.

493
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:17,303
You think we had anything
to do with that?

494
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:20,273
Yeah, I think we did.

495
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:23,503
Nice job, Barney.

496
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:26,405
Oh, my God!

497
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:29,730
Thank you!

498
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:32,256
That was killing my arm.

499
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,177
My arm hasn't been this source
since I was 13 years old

500
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:36,781
and figured out how
to lock a bathroom.

501
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,258
Up top.

502
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:48,770
What's wrong?

503
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,859
Well, I officially didn't get that job.

504
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:53,939
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay. They

505
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:55,876
they offered me another one.

506
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,258
Hey, that's great.
What are you going to be doing?

507
00:20:58,354 --> 00:20:59,837
Foreign correspondent.

508
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:01,053
I'm, hum

509
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:02,624
moving to Japan
