1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kids, there is something
I wish my dad told me.

2
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:07,636
The longest pause
you will ever experience in your life

3
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:09,850
is the one that follows
asking the question...

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,255
Will you marry me?

5
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:15,759
Your brain goes into overdrive,
imaging every possible response.

6
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:17,779
No.

7
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:19,638
Oh, God, no.

8
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:24,921
You want me to marry...

9
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:26,512
No.

10
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:29,528
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't.

11
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:30,562
Mark Johnson,

12
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:33,657
the quarterback from your high school
football team, already asked me.

13
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:35,036
What's up, Turd?

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,808
It's Ted!

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,308
But if you're lucky,

16
00:00:39,428 --> 00:00:43,020
she may answer with the single
greatest word in the English language.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,530
Yes.

18
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,175
Stella and I spent that summer
happily engaged.

19
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:05,059
Marshall was still coping
with unemployment.

20
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:06,351
What are you doing?

21
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:10,452
Lily threw herself
into her painting.

22
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,014
What are you doing?

23
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:15,822
Barney was rehabilitating
from his bus accident.

24
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,404
What are you doing?

25
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,732
And well, Marshall just kept coping
with unemployment.

26
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:26,385
What are you doing?

27
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:32,044
And Robin continued to uphold the high
journalistic standards of Metro News 1.

28
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:37,579
Is your favorite brand of dental floss
poisoning your entire family?

29
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:40,239
Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking...

30
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:41,969
Tooth.

31
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:46,808
Okay, I officially hate my job.

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,065
I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who
shows up at night and scares people.

33
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:53,504
I'm the bogeyman
with a teleprompter.

34
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,611
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."

35
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:01,478
That's hilarious!
Great joke, Robin, great joke.

36
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:04,701
Barney, no offense to Robin,
but that wasn't that funny.

37
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:07,313
Are you kidding?
That was a great joke.

38
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:09,964
It's smart, funny, beautiful,
the whole package.

39
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:12,523
It's everything you're afraid
to let yourself want.

40
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,326
In a joke.

41
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,900
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."

42
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:20,954
Classic.

43
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:26,486
Okay, what is so urgent
that you called me and begged me

44
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:29,217
to come over at 7:22 in the morning?

45
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:32,743
I could tell you knew something
was up with me, and you're right.

46
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:35,999
But I can't tell you what it is.
I should tell you, but I can't!

47
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:39,585
I have to. I never will! I'm going to.
Let's just drop it. What's up with you?

48
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:41,738
Barney, just say it.

49
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:46,827
I think I'm in love with Robin.

50
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:50,856
Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas
for Stella's wedding shower.

51
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:52,474
Does she like to cook?

52
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,511
Actually, I don't know.

53
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,486
What's her favorite color?

54
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,061
Don't know that either.

55
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,791
- Well, does she have any hobbies?
- Yes.

56
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:05,470
She's exactly the kind of person
who would have hobbies.

57
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:07,246
And interests, too.

58
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:09,487
I am one lucky son of a bitch.

59
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,469
Dude,

60
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:13,020
you don't know anything
about the woman you're marrying.

61
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,073
What?

62
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,689
You're crazy! I know plenty.

63
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,392
What color are her eyes?

64
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,028
The color of the ocean
after a storm.

65
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:22,279
Which is?

66
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:26,108
Beautiful.

67
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:28,990
I don't believe it.

68
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,215
I thought you called me over here
to uncuff you from your sex swing again,

69
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,945
but you're in love?

70
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:35,792
That is so sweet!

71
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:37,265
It's not "sweet."

72
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,296
It's like a disease.

73
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:42,215
I slept with Robin one time
and I caught feelings.

74
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,009
I caught feelings bad.

75
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:46,197
I used protection and everything.

76
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:50,765
Barney, you don't "catch" feelings,
you just have them.

77
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,390
- And they're good.
- They're terrible!

78
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,776
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

79
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:58,958
She's all I think about.
I close my eyes, I see Robin.

80
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:01,318
I, I hear a song;
It reminds me of Robin.

81
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:02,253
Morning.

82
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:05,107
I sleep with that chick,
I'm thinking about Robin.

83
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,950
Okay, so I don't know
every single detail about Stella.

84
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,339
What's really about?
Do you not like her or something?

85
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:14,498
No, Ted, I like Stella lot.
She's a Mets fan.

86
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:15,377
Really?

87
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:17,885
It's just that everything with you
has moved so fast.

88
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:19,860
You've only known
each other a few months.

89
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,410
Don't you think maybe you should
slow things down a little bit?

90
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:24,674
- Get to know each other better?
- I'll have a whole life

91
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,321
time to get to know her better.

92
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:29,262
Right now,
I know the one thing that I have to:

93
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:31,125
That I love her.

94
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:32,541
You love her?

95
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:34,949
Barney, how can you be in love,

96
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,354
and still be sleeping
with anything that moves?

97
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,434
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.

98
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:42,144
That's like saying,

99
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:44,915
"How can an ant carry
"20 times its body weight,

100
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,017
but root beer floats
are still delicious?"

101
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:48,615
Are the two even related?

102
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:49,775
Really?

103
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,413
Barney, you're going to have
to stop screwing around

104
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,229
if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.

105
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:57,648
"Boyfriend"?

106
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,835
I don't want to be
Robin's boyfriend.

107
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:01,878
Well, what do you want, then?

108
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:04,381
I don't know.
I just want to be with her.

109
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:05,957
All the time.

110
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:09,182
I want to hear about her day
and tell her about mine.

111
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:12,389
I want to hold her hand
and smell her hair.

112
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,892
But I don't want to be
her stupid boyfriend.

113
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,622
Barney, what you just described

114
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,272
is a relationship between
a boyfriend and a girlfriend.

115
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:24,568
And a pretty clingy one at that.

116
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:27,807
Look, Lily, are you going to help me out
with this or not?

117
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,817
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

118
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:33,640
I see a confused, little kid in the
corner trying to eat the lefty scissors,

119
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,797
I gotta help the poor,
little bastard.

120
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:38,482
But only if you stop
sleeping around.

121
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:39,718
Deal?

122
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,709
Deal.

123
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:42,813
Coming up next,

124
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:47,433
is your local ice cream man actually
driving a roving meth lab on wheels?

125
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:49,663
Stay tuned for the full...

126
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:52,114
Scoop.

127
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:53,249
Really?

128
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:02,170
I know dudes think it's girlie
for a guy to cook, but us ladies?

129
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:05,067
- We find it mighty sexy.
- Really?

130
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:06,427
You know...

131
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,573
My grandma taught me how.

132
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:10,471
- Oh, yeah, she did.
- Yeah.

133
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:13,700
I had a lot of time after school
to watch her cook because

134
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:15,285
I wasn't good at sports.

135
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,663
I'm on fire right now.

136
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,211
Delicious. What's in this pesto?

137
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,394
Oh, you know, the usual:
Basil, garlic, olive oil,

138
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,633
but can you guess
my secret ingredient?

139
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:30,993
Peanuts.

140
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,721
Yes. How did you know that?

141
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:42,292
- OK, let's my think, what else?
- You know what, sweetie?

142
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:45,138
I woke up so early
and I had a really long day at work.

143
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:47,770
And there was that whole thing
where you tried to kill me.

144
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,350
Can we please just go to sleep?

145
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,031
No, I clearly need
to know more about you.

146
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:54,220
Let's do firsts. First kiss?

147
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:56,496
Dale Harris, second grade.

148
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:59,934
You're talking like peck on the cheek
or a full-on passionate making out?

149
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:02,970
- Passionate making out.
- OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.

150
00:07:03,342 --> 00:07:04,737
First time you had sex.

151
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,694
- Dale Harris, second...
- Stop it.

152
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:08,860
Billy Devito,
sophomore year of college.

153
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,020
Prude.

154
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:12,331
Molly McKenzie,
junior year of high school.

155
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:13,451
Slut.

156
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:16,409
Robin just needs
to see this new see of you.

157
00:07:16,723 --> 00:07:18,745
- So just call her up?
- Just call her up.

158
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:22,529
It's...

159
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:25,499
Hi, Robin.

160
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:29,881
She wasn't there.
I left a voice mail.

161
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,075
You left a voice,
but it wasn't male.

162
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:34,171
Barney, I don't get it.

163
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,670
You've called a million girls
a million times.

164
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,430
Yeah,
but those were just booty calls.

165
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,767
On a booty call,
you barely even have to talk.

166
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:44,063
Around 9:00 p.m., you say...
Hey, baby, it's Barney.

167
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:45,996
You busy tonight? Sweet.

168
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,272
See you in half an hour? Can't wait.

169
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,254
But the later it gets,
the fewer words you need.

170
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:53,142
Barney. Busy? Sweet.

171
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:56,191
And by 3:00 in the morning...

172
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:02,929
Sweet.

173
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:05,460
A question mark?

174
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,627
You got laid off a question mark?

175
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,549
It's no worse
than your super-obvious code words.

176
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:17,149
- Rhinoceros.
- We have to go.

177
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,431
Great. Now we need a new code word.

178
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:24,610
Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin.
What do I do?

179
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,688
No-no-no-no, aah! Robin...

180
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:28,682
Great to hear from you.

181
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:30,900
To what do I owe the pleasure?

182
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,971
You called, went, and hung up.

183
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:35,220
What do you want?

184
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,447
Help me!

185
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:38,890
Just ask her something.

186
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,161
How are you feeling today?

187
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:43,635
Fine.

188
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:45,186
Something personal.

189
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,877
At what age
did you first get your period?

190
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:52,630
Did you just ask me
about about my period?

191
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,174
No, I did not.

192
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,437
Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.

193
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,144
Just ask her out.

194
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:03,176
Robin, I was wondering if...

195
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:07,186
Nothing. Gotta go. Bye.

196
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,428
That was just a practical joke.

197
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,349
I'm not really in love with Robin.

198
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,511
You should've seen
the look on your face.

199
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:18,218
There's cameras right there
and there and there.

200
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:23,494
What a legendary prank that
we're never going to speak of again.

201
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,196
Gross.

202
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:35,632
- First movie you ever saw.
- Benji, 1981.

203
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,509
I watched it recently
with Lucy and I just thought,

204
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,221
"Oh, that dog is so dead right now."

205
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:44,552
What about you?

206
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:47,602
My dad took me to an old drive-in
to see the original Star Wars.

207
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,396
You know,
I've actually never seen Star Wars.

208
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,857
She's never seen Star Wars?!

209
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:54,665
Ted, the only people in the universe

210
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:57,010
who haven't seen Star Wars
are the characters,

211
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,731
and that's 'cause they lived them.

212
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:02,007
- That's 'cause they lived the Star Wars.
- You've got to calm down.

213
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:04,862
I told you. You didn't know
this girl well enough. What if

214
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,476
- you show it to her, she doesn't like it?
- Dude, it's just a movie.

215
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:11,132
Star Wars is your all-time
favorite movie,

216
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:13,557
and whether or not Stella likes
it is actually important.

217
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:16,088
It's like, it's a test
of how compatible you guys are.

218
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:18,380
It's just a movie.

219
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:20,260
It's just a movie!

220
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:24,235
<i>121 awesome minutes later.</i>

221
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,832
If Stella doesn't like this movie,

222
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:28,676
- I can't marry her.
- You can't.

223
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:31,263
- You want to watch it again?
- I do.

224
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:41,122
Wait... Where are the boys?
I thought this was a group thing.

225
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,889
I lied. They're not coming
and I'm about to leave.

226
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,009
Why?

227
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:45,934
Because

228
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:48,645
they're not in love with Robin,
and neither am I.

229
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:51,184
I mean, she's great and sweet.

230
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:54,025
I'm not going to pretend
that I haven't noticed her body,

231
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,402
but this is off topic.
Good luck.

232
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,161
Wait, wait, I can't do this.

233
00:10:58,281 --> 00:11:00,312
She'll never take me seriously.
She thinks I'm some

234
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:01,699
womanizing idiot.

235
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,230
We both know
you're more than that.

236
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,139
How Robin the Barney
I met the other day.

237
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,350
You mean the insecure,
touchy-feely she-male

238
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,546
who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?

239
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,022
Ted hit that for over a year.

240
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,215
Wish me luck.

241
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:20,813
I just thought it'd be fun
to watch a movie tonight,

242
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,993
and since you've never seen Star Wars,
I figured why not?

243
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,404
No big deal.

244
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,083
It's pretty good.

245
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:28,977
Sounds like a plan.

246
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:36,480
I'm just grab a beer.
You want one?

247
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,594
The movie's already started, so...

248
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:42,073
It's some words flying through space.
I'm not going to read that anyway.

249
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,233
Oh, my God.

250
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,814
Off to a bad start.

251
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:47,416
What are you doing down there?

252
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:49,989
I'm making sure my best friend
is marrying the right woman.

253
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,415
That's what I'm doing.

254
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:53,509
What are you doing,
hiding behind the couch?

255
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,878
You need to get a job.

256
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:58,320
I really do, don't I?

257
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:01,498
So, Robin

258
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:03,803
tell me about your day,

259
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,477
and not just what happened,
how you felt about what happened.

260
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:11,046
- What?
- I'm not looking to problem-solve,

261
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,729
I'm just looking to listen.

262
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:16,815
- Why are you acting like this?
- Like what?

263
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,367
You're being super nice. It's

264
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:21,284
freaking me out. Be

265
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,345
gross, be inappropriate.
Be Barney.

266
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:26,039
I'm being Barney,

267
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,293
and I think tonight's going to be

268
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,396
de... wait for it... lightful.

269
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:33,827
Delightful.

270
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:35,702
Right.

271
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,674
So I went
to the chiropractor yesterday.

272
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:45,136
That guy bent me over the table
and pounded me for a good hour.

273
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:50,712
Is insurance going to cover that?
Sometimes they don't.

274
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:52,418
That's it?

275
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:57,994
Today I was at the dentist.

276
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,297
That guy drilled me

277
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:02,128
all day long.

278
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,447
He drilled me hard.

279
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,174
He filled all of my cavities.

280
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:08,785
Come on, man.

281
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:12,020
- Your teeth look fantastic.
- Who are you?

282
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:21,439
What?

283
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:23,477
Nothing.

284
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:26,159
You were staring at me.

285
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:29,525
You look really beautiful tonight.

286
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:33,652
You don't look
so bad yourself, mister.

287
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,637
Great scene, great scene.

288
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:39,998
Star Wars fun fact number seven...

289
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:41,934
George Lucas based
the film's structure

290
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,252
on Akira Kurosawa's
The Hidden Fortress.

291
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,422
He also owes a debt to Campbell's work
with comparative mythology.

292
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:49,654
Yeah, Ted,
I'm losing wood over here.

293
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:51,032
What's going on?

294
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:52,314
Nothing.

295
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:54,798
Wait, it's

296
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,724
really important to you
that I like this movie, isn't it?

297
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:04,105
I'm not gonna like it with you
staring at me the whole time.

298
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,796
Go to your room
and I will come get you when it's over.

299
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:07,916
Go.

300
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:16,478
Should I leave, too?

301
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:18,956
What part, what part?

302
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:28,030
Thanks.

303
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:30,223
Nothing?

304
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:31,794
Not even a glance?

305
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:35,603
Even I was thinking about rocking
a motorboat on those bad boys.

306
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:37,556
What the hell is wrong with you?

307
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:41,838
I don't always want to be that guy.
Sometimes I want to be someone

308
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,854
you can have
an actual conversation with.

309
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:48,029
Now, tell me something about you
that I don't know yet.

310
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,710
Seriously.

311
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:56,676
There's a job opening
at a new cable network

312
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,702
that would be perfect for me

313
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:03,280
completely legit world news, interviews
with people who matter,

314
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:07,418
- but I decided I'm not going to apply.
- Why not?

315
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:09,023
Because I'm a joke.

316
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:12,257
I'm just the scary news lady
from some stupid local news channel.

317
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:15,052
We both know you're more than that.

318
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,804
Promise me you'll apply.

319
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:21,892
- It's not as easy...
- Promise me you'll apply.

320
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:26,655
I promise.

321
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,083
She's up to the scene
where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape

322
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:34,750
- from the Death Star's trash compactor.
- Great scene.

323
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:36,490
Greatscene?

324
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,263
Okay, we should have just heard,

325
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,418
but Stella didn't make a peep.
I'm gonna take a look.

326
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,762
She's not even watching.
She's texting.

327
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:03,140
- I'll tell her you still want to be friends.
- I don't believe this.

328
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:06,681
I believe, she knows this is important
to me. She's blatantly...

329
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:12,025
"Stop watching me, jackasses."

330
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:16,047
- To taking chances.
- To taking chances.

331
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:22,888
You know, Robin, there's actually
something, I do want to talk to you about.

332
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:25,272
- Last call.
- Of course it is.

333
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,624
- One more for the road?
- Yeah, why not?

334
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:29,351
Hold that thought?

335
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:33,153
I will.

336
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:43,336
- I loved it.
- Yes!

337
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:46,957
I am marrying a woman
who is not only hot

338
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:49,313
but loves Star Wars.
That's the dream.

339
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,371
- What was that?
- I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me

340
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:56,521
through the space-time continuum.
We did it.

341
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,698
We did it,
you masturbating little bastard.

342
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,573
Champagne for everybody.

343
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:05,894
It was so good.

344
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:08,732
- You hated it, didn't you?
- It's so stupid. First of all,

345
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:11,960
how do they understand that walking bear
they hang around with all the time?

346
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,671
- Wookiee.
- He goes...

347
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:17,396
They're all like,
"That's a good point, Bear,

348
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:19,429
- "let's try that."
- He's a Wookiee,

349
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:22,531
and his kind is actually
more intelligent than they appear.

350
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:27,342
That is Ted's favorite movie
of all time.

351
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,796
He watches it
when he's home sick with the flu.

352
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,845
He watches it on rainy
Sunday afternoons in the fall.

353
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,775
He watches it on Christmas Eve.

354
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,954
Ted watches Star Wars
in sickness and in health,

355
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:40,864
in good times and in bad.

356
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,562
Do you really think that you can pretend
to like a movie that you actually hate

357
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:47,407
for the rest of your life?

358
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:53,124
I do.

359
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:56,588
Then, Ted's a lucky guy.

360
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:02,587
Bear.

361
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:08,110
So, here's the deal.

362
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,846
April, have... you met Barney?

363
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:16,942
April just finished her shift,
she's looking to blow off some steam.

364
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,047
Would you excuse us for one sec?

365
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:24,851
- What are you doing?
- You were so nice to me tonight,

366
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,285
I wanted to return the favor,
wingwoman-style.

367
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:29,871
So, as I was saying,

368
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:32,393
Barney is the Yankees'
new second-baseman.

369
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:36,446
And Barney, April asked if tomorrow,
you could hit a goal for her

370
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:38,419
during the baseball match.

371
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:40,590
You can't make this stuff up.

372
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,235
So, you two kids have fun.

373
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,223
So are you...
nervous about the game?

374
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:50,350
Yeah, I'm nervous
for the other team

375
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:53,437
'cause when I step
up to that plate...

376
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:58,108
I am not a New York Yankee.

377
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,016
Any other night, I would probably try
to convince you that I am, but I'm not.

378
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,379
I'm just some guy who's in love
with the girl that just left,

379
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:08,463
and she's never going
to feel the same way.

380
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:12,159
So I'm just going to go.

381
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,848
And that was it.

382
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:16,626
I'm so sorry, Barney.

383
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:20,236
You can't give up.

384
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:23,633
You know, it may take some time,
but once Robin sees the new you...

385
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:28,430
When my family gets to Yankee Stadium,
are the tickets under your name or mine?

386
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,080
My name, and tell your
nephews to bring their mitts.

387
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,018
They're going to be
in foul ball country.

388
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:38,732
Come on.
The Robin stuff was completely true.

389
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:41,236
Damn it, Barney.

390
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:43,465
I mean, for the last time,

391
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,594
you can't... you can't

392
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:47,891
be in love with Robin
and still be sleeping

393
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,877
with every bimbo on the planet.

394
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,662
You have to choose right now.

395
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,290
- I choose bimbos.
- What?

396
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,739
Bimbos make me happy.
Bimbos make me feel alive.

397
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:04,091
Bimbos make me want
to pretend to be a better man.

398
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:08,217
This whole thing with Robin was just
a fling, but at the end of the day,

399
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,720
my heart belongs to bimbos.

400
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:13,475
This is just a defense mechanism,
because

401
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:16,728
you're afraid of getting hurt.
You're just confused.

402
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:18,524
Oh, I'm not confused.

403
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:20,813
You know who is confused?

404
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:22,314
Bimbos.

405
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:25,402
They're easily confused.
It's one of the thousand little things

406
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:26,883
I love about them.

407
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:29,186
I love their vacant,

408
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:33,153
trusting stares, their sluggish,
unencumbered minds,

409
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:35,636
their unresolved daddy issues.

410
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:38,625
I love them and they love me.

411
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,092
Bimbos have always been there for me,
through thick and thin.

412
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:45,924
Mostly thin.
B-man don't do thick crust.

413
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:47,084
What up?

414
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,342
See you, Barney.

415
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:20,179
Chimixanga.

416
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:21,603
We have to go.
