1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:03,217
<i>Kids, the day you get married
is supposed to be</i>

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:04,960
<i>the happiest day of your life,</i>

3
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,862
<i>the perfect ending
to a perfect love story.</i>

4
00:00:08,153 --> 00:00:10,474
<i>My wedding...
at least my first wedding</i>

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,801
<i>didn't go so well.</i>

6
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,888
<i>It's funny looking back on it now.</i>

7
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:30,780
I was so sure Stella was the one.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,081
And when she left me,
I was so devastated.

9
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,216
But you guys got me through it.

10
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,574
And now the painful part's over.

11
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:41,659
I've come out the other side
a little bit stronger.

12
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:45,330
You know, I hardly even
think about her anymore.

13
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,702
That's what time does, I guess.

14
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:52,854
Ted, the wedding was yesterday.

15
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:55,390
It's been 24 hours.

16
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:56,715
I know.

17
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:58,906
And this is me, moving on.

18
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:01,604
A great new chapter
of my life began today,

19
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:03,446
and we're gonna celebrate.
Right now,

20
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,483
we need two things.
We need Kool,

21
00:01:05,823 --> 00:01:07,278
and we need the Gang.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,296
It's jukebox time, huh?

23
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,047
I look at that young man

24
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:18,249
popping and locking his way over
to the jukebox,

25
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:20,830
and I think to myself,
you know

26
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:23,117
maybe Stella made the right call.

27
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:25,429
Pain.

28
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:26,954
How is he dancing right now?

29
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:28,361
He should be smashing up.

30
00:01:28,432 --> 00:01:30,403
Stella's car with a sledgehammer.

31
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:32,162
Hypothetical.

32
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:34,590
Ted isn't pretending to be happy.

33
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:36,162
Ted really is happy.

34
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,216
He never wanted to get married
in the first place.

35
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:40,995
Ted just pulled off
the greatest train dodge

36
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:42,613
since Stand by Me.

37
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:45,569
Well, not the first kid,
but the other kids.

38
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:49,578
No, he is in bad shape.

39
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:51,126
What's up?

40
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,247
Really bad shape.

41
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,710
And we need to be there for him.

42
00:01:57,132 --> 00:01:59,692
<i>But as much as my friends
wanted to be there for me,</i>

43
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,758
<i>I was, by all appearances</i>

44
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:02,571
<i>fine.</i>

45
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:04,841
- Hey, buddy.
- Want to hang out?

46
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:07,586
Guys, I'm fine.

47
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:10,759
Hey, pal, you want to have a catch?

48
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:12,261
I'm fine.

49
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:17,516
Hey, kiddo.

50
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:21,768
I'm fine.
This is not necessary, and

51
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,297
it's actually kind of weird.

52
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:24,446
No offense, ladies.

53
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,132
I did not realize you'd be home.

54
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,830
Ladies, to the stairwell.

55
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:45,384
<i>Finally, after two weeks,</i>

56
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,250
<i>the inevitable emotions boiled over.</i>

57
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,028
Hey, you guys want to get some dinner?

58
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:50,076
Oh, shut up.

59
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,182
I'm sorry, sweetie. It's just...

60
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,769
Ted, you've been through
something traumatic,

61
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:58,167
and we're trying to
be there for you as friends,

62
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,668
but you're not letting us,

63
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,151
and it's pissing us off,
you selfish bitch.

64
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,679
Sorry.

65
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:06,746
Look, we're just worried that you're not
dealing with this whole Stella thing.

66
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,746
Okay? Do you remember
when Lily left me?

67
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:10,752
You remember how
I held in my feelings?

68
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:12,438
I...

69
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,541
miss

70
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:15,661
her so much.

71
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,721
Yeah, dude, you were a rock.

72
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,597
Well, I should have been
even worse, okay?

73
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,758
I should have gotten mad.

74
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:25,521
I should have taken your advice
and set all of Lily's stuff on fire.

75
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,286
Oh, nice. Thanks, Ted.

76
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,340
But I didn't,
and I think that that's why

77
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:31,523
it took me so long to get better.
So, now, Ted...

78
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,244
I want you to explode.

79
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,898
Release the berserker.

80
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,775
Okay, ready?

81
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:40,762
Now!

82
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:42,483
- I'm good.
- No.

83
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:44,794
Guys, get off his back.

84
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:45,912
He's happy.

85
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,926
Listen, if Ted were married right now,

86
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:52,090
he'd be married, he'd be living
in New Jersey, and

87
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:54,058
he'd be married.

88
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:57,354
He's fine. Now, let's eat.
How about Flat Michael's?

89
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,279
No, that's 44th and Lex.
Can't do it.

90
00:03:59,385 --> 00:04:00,085
Why not?

91
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:02,000
It's too close to Stella's gym.
Might run into her.

92
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,056
Anywhere else, though.

93
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,168
Okay... how about Hurley's?

94
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:08,511
Right between Stella's office
and her dry cleaners.

95
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:09,628
No, sir.

96
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:11,551
Well, what about meat loaf Charlie's?

97
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:13,745
Two blocks
from Stella's mother's hairdressers.

98
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:17,616
Well, geez, Ted, is there anywhere
in Manhattan we can go to dinner?

99
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:19,516
Of course.

100
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,238
Check this out.

101
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:24,182
What you got there, Ted?

102
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,188
A little reference map
I made for myself.

103
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:29,308
A New York guide to places you
might run into Stella Zinman.

104
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,291
Red areas are places to avoid.

105
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:32,660
White areas are safe.

106
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:33,918
Blue is water.

107
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,569
That is just ridiculous.

108
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:37,246
Well, water is blue.

109
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:39,194
You can't live that way.

110
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:41,876
She leaves you at the altar,
and you're the one avoiding her?

111
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,419
Yes, I'm avoiding her.
What's the big deal?

112
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,672
That's how we do it.

113
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:47,020
Who's we, gutless weenies?

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,129
No, "we" is people
from the great state of Ohio.

115
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,665
When life gives us pain,

116
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,926
we Buckeyes take that pain
and we push it down.

117
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:57,873
And if the pain starts
to come up again,

118
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,114
we push more pain down on top of it.

119
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:02,434
Why confront something
when you can avoid it, right?

120
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:04,827
All I have to do
is never see Stella again,

121
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,528
and I'll live a long, happy life.

122
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,862
Now, who wants to get something to eat?

123
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:11,033
Oh, somebody just told me about
a tapas place

124
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,481
that's in the white zone.

125
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:14,165
Great. Let's go there.

126
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:16,878
You ready to order?

127
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,173
Not quite yet.

128
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:20,154
Can we get some of those almonds
for the table?

129
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:21,214
Certainly.

130
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,088
Nice call, Lily.

131
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:24,413
This place looks great.

132
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:25,636
Who told you about it?

133
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,416
You know, I don't remember.

134
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
What?

135
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,061
I'd just remember.

136
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:44,404
Oh, my God.

137
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:46,257
Okay, just be cool.

138
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:47,958
We're just gonna have
to deal with this.

139
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:49,225
Everyone

140
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,154
follow my lead.

141
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:55,647
- You're kidding.
- Is he serious?

142
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,723
I am not getting under this table.

143
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:00,515
I'd maybe get under that table.

144
00:06:01,254 --> 00:06:02,404
She's turning around.

145
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:09,524
Think.

146
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,369
Everyone, just stay here.
I'm gonna go take a look.

147
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:14,412
Marshall, go take a look.

148
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,657
And will you need utensils?

149
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,288
No, I'm just going straight home.

150
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,839
She's placing an order to go.

151
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:29,660
Did she seem happy?

152
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:30,931
Did she say anything about me?

153
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:32,587
I don't even care.

154
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:33,898
Where are those almonds?

155
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,470
Gosh, where would Ted's nuts be?

156
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:38,461
Hey, why don't you check
the vise in Stella's garage?

157
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,104
Go yell at her.

158
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:41,640
Ted, you may be from Ohio,

159
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,256
but you live in New York now.

160
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:45,497
We don't push down
our feelings in New York.

161
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:48,511
We take our feelings and we shove them
in somebody else's face!

162
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:49,943
Oh, spare me, Lily.

163
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:52,182
You'd be doing the same thing
if you were in this situation.

164
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:53,250
That's outrageous.

165
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,285
There is not a person on Earth

166
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,256
I would hide under a table from.

167
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:59,367
Really, not a single person?

168
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:00,473
Not even...

169
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,030
Gasser?

170
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:04,891
How dare you mention that name to me.

171
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:06,111
Who's Gasser?

172
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,642
He's the last person I'd want to see
walk through that door.

173
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,272
Michael Sasser.

174
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,419
He's a guy I went to high school with.

175
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:16,184
<i>Michael sat next to me
in freshman biology.</i>

176
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:19,116
<i>He had been a bit of a loser
all through middle school,</i>

177
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:20,782
<i>but the summer before ninth grade,</i>

178
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,538
<i>he grew 12 inches
and joined the baseball team.</i>

179
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:26,942
<i>He was right on the precipice
of becoming one of the cool kids.</i>

180
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:28,396
<i>Until one day...</i>

181
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,624
We've all been there.

182
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,360
When you've ripped one,
it's not pretty.

183
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,862
What did you do?

184
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:38,046
Are you kidding?

185
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:39,806
This was ninth grade.

186
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,882
I only had one choice.

187
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:46,408
Oh, my God, Sasser. Fart much?

188
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:49,059
No, it wasn't me. It was her.

189
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,924
As if, Sasser.

190
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:52,613
More like Gasser.

191
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:57,020
Gasser!

192
00:07:57,454 --> 00:08:00,199
I'm on the baseball team.
I'm cool.

193
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:04,066
The nickname Gasser stuck.

194
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:07,632
He got teased so much, eventually
he had to change schools.

195
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,181
Kids are awesome.

196
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:11,492
I've always felt awful about that.

197
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,835
But if Gasser...

198
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:13,964
Michael

199
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:15,768
walked in right now,

200
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:18,243
as hard as it would be,
I would go up to Gasser...

201
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:19,357
Michael,

202
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,398
and I would resolve things between us.

203
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:23,357
Right, clear the air, as it were.

204
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,208
Oh, man.

205
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:27,342
Those don't come around often.

206
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:29,254
Y'all are welcome.

207
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:33,134
- Hey, are you guys okay?
- Oh, yeah.

208
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,259
We're just gonna be eating down here
if that's okay.

209
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:36,458
Well, here's your almonds.

210
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:38,491
Thanks...
you guys have any specials today?

211
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,509
Ted, this is ludicrous.

212
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,667
Ted, I am a person who...

213
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,950
Well, let's just face it.

214
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:46,155
There are a lot of people
I don't want to see

215
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:48,941
people of the
"chicks I banged" persuasion,

216
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,457
but if any of them were to walk in here,
I would stand up,

217
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,568
and I would look them right in the eye.

218
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,575
Some of them for the very first time.

219
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,871
Really, you wouldn't hide from anyone?

220
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:01,475
Not even, say...

221
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:02,941
Becca Delucci?

222
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:04,572
You son of a bitch.

223
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:06,299
Who's Becca Delucci?

224
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:07,663
Do you mind?

225
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,220
So, who is Becca Delucci?

226
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:14,170
Becca is just this

227
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,805
girl who lives upstate.
I used to visit her now and again.

228
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:20,054
Where exactly upstate, Barney?

229
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:23,362
Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.

230
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:27,640
<i>And yes, the visits were
of a conjugal nature.</i>

231
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,406
- No way, really?
- Really.

232
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:35,054
And what I had with Becca
was a perfect relationship.

233
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:38,679
She was only allowed, by law,
to call me once a week.

234
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,906
If she ever got clingy,
the armed guards stopped her.

235
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,924
And I never had to pay for dinner.

236
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:45,123
Well, that's not true.

237
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,226
I pay taxes.

238
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:47,606
Then again, I guess
we all paid for dinner.

239
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,630
Thanks a lot, guys.

240
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,103
Anyway, the last time I visited,

241
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,044
I kind of screwed things up.

242
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:55,003
I know it's hard, baby,

243
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:57,584
but I'm in a prison, too.

244
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,877
A prison of my own heart.

245
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:04,090
Is that room ready yet or what?
Can we...? Tick-tock.

246
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,844
Barney, you're the only thing
that's keeping me going here.

247
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,409
That's what I'm here for, baby.

248
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:10,594
I'm your rock.

249
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,819
I'm... oh, my God.
Hello, strange.

250
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:21,101
Barney Stinson, attorney at law.

251
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:24,092
- Let's talk about getting you off.
- Oh, hell, no!

252
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:38,716
Now I get letters from Becca
and she's all,

253
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,194
"I'm coming to get you the day
I get out of here.

254
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:44,342
I'm gonna hang your eyes
from my rearview mirror."

255
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:46,396
Women, huh?

256
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:48,507
See?

257
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,804
You're scared of Becca.
Lily's scared of Gasser.

258
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:52,259
We're staying under the table.

259
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:56,801
We don't have to.

260
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,625
- Stella's gone.
- Oh, my gosh.

261
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:06,659
There, all done,
and that's how we do it Ohio style.

262
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:09,181
Problem showed up. We avoided it.
It went away.

263
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:10,343
Now we can enjoy our meal

264
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,997
- in peace and...
- She's back.

265
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,893
Ted, we all think that you need...

266
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,413
Wait, where's Barney?

267
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:30,004
We all think that you need
to go talk to her.

268
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:31,084
- I don't.
- What?

269
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:32,784
Yeah, if the last person I wanted to see

270
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,661
walked through the door,
I wouldn't say a damn word.

271
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:36,199
- Really?
- And who's that?

272
00:11:36,386 --> 00:11:37,386
My father.

273
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:40,696
You guys, that other table
is off the hook.

274
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,159
- What are we talking about?
- Robin's dad.

275
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:44,636
I haven't spoken to him in three years

276
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,092
and I don't intend to start now.

277
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,221
Why?

278
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:49,587
<i>It goes back to the day I was born.</i>

279
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,661
You give me my son now. Push.

280
00:11:58,358 --> 00:11:59,358
He wanted a son

281
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,584
and the fact that I was a girl
didn't change his plan.

282
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,759
What do you mean?

283
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:07,425
My full legal name is
Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr.

284
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:10,158
And it only gets worse from there.

285
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,817
<i>When I was eight, he took me
hunting for the first time.</i>

286
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,683
I don't want to shoot a deer.

287
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:16,832
Nonsense, R.J.

288
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:19,494
Shooting deer
is the noblest of pursuits.

289
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:21,429
But they're cute.

290
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:23,541
You said the same thing
about our rabbits.

291
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:25,465
Remember how delicious they were?

292
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:28,933
Over the years, as my body developed...

293
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:30,212
Hold on a sec.

294
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:32,898
Sorry, go on.

295
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:37,426
It became harder and harder for him
to pretend I was a boy.

296
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,731
<i>The lowest moment came
when I turned 14.</i>

297
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,604
<i>My peewee hockey team had just
won the Squamish Invitational</i>

298
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:44,613
<i>and everyone came back
to my house to celebrate.</i>

299
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:48,384
You lads availed yourself
splendidly out there on the ice.

300
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,886
Splendidly.

301
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:51,449
You go on outside.

302
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:54,199
I'll come back with an assortment
of soft drinks

303
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:55,748
and American pretzels.

304
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,538
I can't believe you missed that
last empty-netter, you hoser.

305
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:04,366
- You're the hoser.
- No, you're the hoser.

306
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,188
What are you doing?

307
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,071
You're teammates,
hockey players.

308
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:19,968
Teammates don't kiss!

309
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:23,068
Hockey players don't kiss!

310
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:26,306
Oh, my God.

311
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:28,631
I have no son.

312
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:34,316
You poor thing.

313
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:37,143
To have to grow up in Canada

314
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,961
with America right there.

315
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:42,316
That sucks about your dad, Robin,

316
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,793
but congratulations on that game.

317
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,606
And Kyle and I weren't even doing
anything serious.

318
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,224
We only went to the blue line.

319
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:51,726
- Blue line?
- Yeah.

320
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:52,672
You know how when you're a kid,

321
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:54,279
you put everything into hockey terms?

322
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:56,578
The blue line is kissing,
the red line is getting naked,

323
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,065
and I think "in the crease" speaks
for itself.

324
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:01,136
Anyway, after that,

325
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:03,658
my relationship with my dad
pretty much went north.

326
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:04,945
I moved in with my mom,

327
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:06,060
grew my hair out,

328
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,887
became a Canadian pop star.
You know, normal teen stuff.

329
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,933
Don't you think it would feel better
to talk to him about all this?

330
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,058
No, that's the point.
It wouldn't solve anything.

331
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,028
It's in the past. It's done.

332
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:20,280
I mean, what would I even say to him?

333
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:22,193
"I wish you hadn't raised me as a boy"?

334
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,625
"I wish you hadn't taught me
how to hunt

335
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:27,100
and fish and smoke cigars
and drink Scotch

336
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,684
because that's not what girls do.

337
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:31,018
And you know the reason
I throw like a girl, Dad,

338
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:32,707
"is because I am a girl."

339
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:38,346
You held onto that for a long time?

340
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,322
It really messed you up.

341
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:45,885
- That sucks.
- I'm sorry.

342
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:46,985
It's hot.

343
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,187
<i>And then I realized</i>

344
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:54,738
<i>all of my friends were haunted,</i>

345
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:57,854
<i>but there was a difference
between my ghost and theirs.</i>

346
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,705
<i>It wasn't too late for me.</i>

347
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,098
I'm gonna go talk to her.

348
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:10,427
She's gone.

349
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,254
- I'm going after her.
- Go, go, go.

350
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,709
There she goes!

351
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,985
Okay, I see her.
She's two cabs ahead on the right.

352
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,206
Just stay with her, okay?

353
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:28,128
Finally.

354
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,506
Finally, you're doing this.

355
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:30,667
You're going to confront her.

356
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:32,650
- Yes, I am going to confront her.
- Yeah.

357
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:34,268
- This is so exciting.
- Totally.

358
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,390
What are you going to say?

359
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,564
I'm gonna say, "Stella,

360
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,076
I'm sorry things didn't work out."

361
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:43,844
We're going to talk
about this like adults.

362
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,801
She can tell me her side and...

363
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:47,642
I'm going to listen.

364
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,783
Probably should have done
a little more of that before.

365
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,543
Driver, can you run us
into the nearest lamppost?

366
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,138
Everyone, buckle up.
Not you, Ted.

367
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:56,259
Ted, you got to get mad right now.

368
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:57,376
Come on.

369
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,212
Dig deep.

370
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,405
Dude, come on.
This isn't about me waving my arms,

371
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,179
stamping my feet,
and getting really mad.

372
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:05,065
This is about Stella and I
finally communicating.

373
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,786
- I mean, clearly, that was...
- Stella hated Star Wars.

374
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,295
She lied to you.

375
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:12,321
Search your feelings, Ted.
You know it to be true.

376
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:14,499
Well, that's her business.

377
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:17,693
Come on, Ted.
She left you at the altar.

378
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:18,909
I don't understand!

379
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:20,903
Ted, in the name of all
that is sacred...

380
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:22,088
Wait!

381
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:23,068
Where is she going?

382
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:25,149
Her cab just missed the turn
for the Lincoln Tunnel.

383
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,722
Why would anybody buy take out food

384
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,909
and bring it all the way back
to New Jersey anyway?

385
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:30,574
Maybe she's going to her office.

386
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,343
<i>The waiter asked her,</i>

387
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,530
<i>"Will you need utensils?"</i>

388
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,765
<i>And then she said, "No,
I'm just going straight home."</i>

389
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,220
But if she's going home,
why are we still heading...

390
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:41,327
Oh, my God.

391
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:44,010
Tony lives downtown.

392
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:45,655
"Home"

393
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,506
is Tony's apartment.

394
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:48,761
She was going to make me

395
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:50,172
move to New Jersey

396
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:53,785
and then she moves into the city
with Tony?!

397
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,662
Son of a bitch!

398
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:01,313
- I am so angry right now!
- I know, and I love it!

399
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:04,727
Yeah, that is awesome!

400
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:08,234
Sir, we'd be happy to cover
the cost of that window crank.

401
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,908
I love angry Ted!

402
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:11,175
So do I!

403
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,011
Get it out, baby. Let it out.

404
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,148
She's stopping.

405
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:19,327
- It is on. It is on!
- Yes, Ted.

406
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,884
- Go get her, buddy!
- Go get rid of your demons!

407
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,890
- My leg is asleep!
- Okay, wa-wa-wait.

408
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:25,692
- Wait, hold on.
- Lily, what are you doing?

409
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:27,745
All right, hold on.

410
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:29,470
Look, Ted,

411
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:30,608
it's great

412
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,433
- that you're angry right now.
- It sure is.

413
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:35,987
And that you're finally dealing
with this, but

414
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:37,864
you only get one shot here.

415
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:39,248
Let's just take a beat and,

416
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:41,377
and think about
what you're going to say.

417
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:44,316
Oh, I know exactly what I'm gonna say.

418
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:56,832
You picked the wrong guy.

419
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,428
You picked the wrong guy.

420
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:05,464
You made a really,

421
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:07,130
really,

422
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,054
really bad choice.

423
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:11,799
What were you thinking?

424
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:13,171
That guy?

425
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:15,083
Are you kidding me?

426
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,989
Have you learned nothing
in the last eight years?

427
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,116
You're just gonna regret this.

428
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:21,004
You know that, right?

429
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,787
You are going to regret this,

430
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:24,601
and now there is nothing
you can do about it

431
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:26,071
because it's too late.

432
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:28,638
All you can do now is go up there

433
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:30,626
and start your crappy,

434
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,045
disappointing life

435
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,368
that will never be nearly as happy

436
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,468
as the one you could have had with me.

437
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:39,613
Good-bye.

438
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,487
- Ted, wait.
- Look, Stella,

439
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,740
I am not here to win you back.

440
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,464
I am here because

441
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:46,672
I need to know

442
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:47,857
that you know

443
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,576
you made the biggest mistake
of your life.

444
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,089
I know.

445
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,581
Good.

446
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:01,938
That's what I'm gonna say.

447
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:04,554
- Dag!
- Cold-blooded.

448
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:06,760
Yeah, that's good. Go say that.

449
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:10,689
Thanks.

450
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,053
<i>So I got out of the cab,
ready to say all of that stuff,</i>

451
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,484
<i>ready to explode,</i>

452
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:16,657
<i>but then...</i>

453
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:19,179
- Mommy!
- Hey.

454
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,702
<i>It all just went away.</i>

455
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:30,591
<i>And that was it.</i>

456
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:33,192
<i>In that moment, I wasn't angry anymore.</i>

457
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,547
<i>I could see Stella was meant
to be with Tony.</i>

458
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,268
<i>Kids, you may think
your only choices</i>

459
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:40,512
<i>are to swallow your anger</i>

460
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:42,437
<i>or throw it in someone's face.</i>

461
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,138
<i>There's a third option:</i>

462
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,897
<i>You can just let it go,</i>

463
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:48,372
<i>and only when you do that
is it really gone,</i>

464
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:49,745
<i>and you can move forward.</i>

465
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,434
<i>And that, kids,</i>

466
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:54,464
<i>was the perfect ending
to a perfect love story.</i>

467
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,169
<i>It just wasn't mine.</i>

468
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:58,538
<i>Mine was still out there</i>

469
00:19:58,738 --> 00:19:59,808
<i>waiting for me.</i>
