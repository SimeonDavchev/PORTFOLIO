1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,031
<i>Why do we fight?</i>

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,101
<i>What does that thing
deep within each of us,</i>

3
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:08,163
<i>that compels us to settle
disagreements with our fists?</i>

4
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:11,393
<i>Whatever it is,
it's there right from the beginning.</i>

5
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:14,168
- Stop fighting!
- Why?

6
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:16,664
Because it's stupid
and juvenile.

7
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,364
We're six.
We are stupid and juvenile.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,238
<i>Kids, I've only been
in one fight in my life.</i>

9
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:27,386
<i>And this is the story
of how it happened.</i>

10
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:30,024
<i>Now, as you know,
I recently had been left at the altar.</i>

11
00:00:30,194 --> 00:00:32,268
<i>And the worst thing
about getting left at the altar?</i>

12
00:00:32,438 --> 00:00:34,774
<i>I mean, aside from
actually getting left at the altar,</i>

13
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:36,273
<i>was what came next.</i>

14
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:39,765
<i>A steady unrelenting
unbearable stream of pity.</i>

15
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:42,191
Cranberry Gin and tonic.

16
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,121
Scotch and soda.

17
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:49,576
Thank you.

18
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:54,156
Could I see a menu?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,948
I'm going to go get you a menu,

20
00:00:58,188 --> 00:00:59,532
but I promise you.

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,553
I will come back.

22
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,909
We have to start
going some place else.

23
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:08,709
At this bar,
I'm always going to be

24
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:11,901
the guy who got left at
the altar. That sucks!

25
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,180
Good times.

26
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:15,683
- We lost Barney.
- What do you mean?

27
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,987
There's a girl over there
in a tight red sweater.

28
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:20,195
So he's not listening
to a word anyone's saying.

29
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:21,295
Right, Barney?

30
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:22,679
Give me a break!

31
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:24,210
See, he figured out a while back

32
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,862
he could fake an entire conversation

33
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:28,789
just by saying titles of black sitcoms
from the 70's and 80's.

34
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,138
What's happening?

35
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,538
Want to go upstairs and do stuff to me

36
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:35,327
that I won't even let Marshall do?

37
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:38,030
Different strokes.

38
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:41,202
What the hell is this?!

39
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,083
<i>I've told you kids about Doug, right?</i>

40
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,967
<i>I haven't? Oh, well...</i>

41
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:47,725
<i>Doug Martin was a bartender
at MacLaren's.</i>

42
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:49,498
<i>He was always kind of around.</i>

43
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:51,495
- Have... you met Ted?
- What?

44
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:53,235
We're not playing
"Have you met Ted?".

45
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:54,335
Am I dead?

46
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:55,957
Am I dead?

47
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:57,452
Tonight...

48
00:01:58,064 --> 00:01:59,527
I pick up a lesbian.

49
00:01:59,697 --> 00:02:02,384
<i>Anyway, three things
you need to know about Doug.</i>

50
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:05,067
<i>The first thing is that Doug
had a bit of a violent streak.</i>

51
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,918
crumbled, so he's
on the ground, right?

52
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:10,224
And we're just kicking him!
He's making that face, all shaking.

53
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:14,153
So, anyway, what we did
was we left him there.

54
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:16,136
Top you off?

55
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:20,145
<i>The second thing is that
he was weird about his hair.</i>

56
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,183
What?

57
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:23,372
What?

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,319
Are you looking at my hair?

59
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:27,393
No, sir. I was not.

60
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:29,517
It's a toupee.

61
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,070
Is that funny?
You want to laugh it up?

62
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:34,463
Is it funny, guy? Is it?

63
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:36,300
I'll tell you what,
why don't you grab it?

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,893
- Excuse me?
- Go ahead, grab it.

65
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,922
Grab it right off my head.
Go ahead.

66
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:42,232
You don't want to grab it?
Come on.

67
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:43,865
Come on, go ahead and grab it.

68
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:47,308
Want to grab it off my head?
Grab my toupee right off my head.

69
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:54,271
I like you guys!

70
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:58,334
<i>But the third thing is that
he was very loyal to his regulars.</i>

71
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:01,355
There they are!
Hey, you guys want your booth?

72
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:03,166
We're fine over here.

73
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,845
<i>Maybe a little too loyal.</i>

74
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,307
No, it's fine.

75
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,758
Okay, you two lovebirds!
Let's take this somewhere else

76
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,105
booth's reserved.

77
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:12,521
Let's go! Now! Come on!

78
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,401
Let's see some hustle, Father.
Up you get.

79
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,837
Okay, guys, here we are!

80
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,287
<i>So, that's Doug.</i>

81
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:19,905
What the hell is this?!

82
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,923
Some guys are
sitting in our booth.

83
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:24,065
But you know what? This is fine.

84
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,896
Let's go, I'll take care of it.

85
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:31,136
Oh boy, there he goes.

86
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,982
Ladies, if you'll please adjourn
to your usual booth.

87
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:43,444
Gentlemen, I will require
your assistance outside.

88
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:44,837
Our assistance with what?

89
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:47,205
We're going to go out in the alley
and fight those guys.

90
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,108
What's happening now?

91
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:05,412
I'm sorry, did you just say
we were gonna...

92
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,937
Those guys are being
inconsiderate, okay?

93
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:09,319
So we're going to go outside

94
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,313
and cave in their skulls, okay?
This will be fun!

95
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,054
He wants us to fight? Like...

96
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,060
Like, with our hands and stuff?

97
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,888
And feet maybe?
I don't know what the rules are.

98
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:24,716
A fight. Should we go out there?

99
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:25,764
Come on, Ted.

100
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,934
There's only three things
you'll ever see me fight:

101
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:29,942
The stubborn clasp of a bra,

102
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:32,942
sexual harassment charges...
nine for nine...

103
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:37,827
And the urge to vomit when I see
someone wearing brown shoes

104
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:39,351
with a black suit.

105
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:44,330
Dude, fighting is for losers.
We're civilized guys.

106
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:47,250
Civilized guys don't fight.
Unless it's with lightsabers.

107
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:49,230
But that's like three
to five years away, so...

108
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,882
Well, that's not true.

109
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:52,888
Robin, I'm on the forums every day.

110
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,468
Three to five Thanksgivings from now,

111
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:57,134
I'm going to be carving
the turkey with Old Green.

112
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,746
No, I'm saying there are plenty
of legitimate reasons

113
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,062
to get in a fight...
it might not be pretty,

114
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:05,930
but in certain situations,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

115
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:08,699
Right, I forgot.
She thinks fighting's sexy.

116
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,177
No, I do not! A lot...

117
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,493
Look, I come from a culture
of hockey players.

118
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:18,379
If a guy can throw down,
it's somewhat way hot.

119
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:21,053
And scars, hello!

120
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:23,481
If a guy's got a scar,
he's got a Robin.

121
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:26,315
And if he's missing teeth?
I'm missing my pants.

122
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,855
I'm missing my wisdom teeth.

123
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,273
Outpatient procedure.

124
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:35,765
Local anesthesia.
Whatever. It ain't a thing.

125
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,779
Maybe we should go out there.

126
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:42,037
I can't believe we're even having
this discussion.

127
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:45,546
You're 30,
you're too old to act like this.

128
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:48,857
<i>I was 30 and in those 30 years
I'd been punched once.</i>

129
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:51,560
There's a very simple explana...

130
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:53,450
<i>There was that thing at camp.</i>

131
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,596
Today, we're going to braid
friendship bracelets.

132
00:05:57,646 --> 00:05:59,974
<i>In college, I studied some Kung Fu.</i>

133
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,954
<i>And well, there was
some other stuff.</i>

134
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:14,230
<i>The thing with the goat wasn't
for another few months.</i>

135
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,477
<i>The point is,
I had never been in a fight.</i>

136
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:17,937
I'm going out there.

137
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:19,309
Dude, listen to me,

138
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,927
please, trust me, I've been
in plenty of fights. It's

139
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:23,795
really nothing to be proud of.

140
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:25,871
Who did you get in a fight with?

141
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,389
My brothers.

142
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:32,903
I'm sure that was quite a rumble
in the Eriksen rumpus room.

143
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:37,355
- I love brotherly horseplay!
- Here comes the tickle monster!

144
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,107
Noogie patrol!

145
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:42,581
Wait, wait, wait! Timesies! Timesies!

146
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,465
Cocoa break.

147
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:49,705
Cocoa break.

148
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,332
It's clobbering time.

149
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:54,873
Ted, don't do this.

150
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:57,811
You're a nice guy.
That's your best quality.

151
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:58,793
Is it?

152
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:01,453
'Cause I seem to rember this nice guy
getting dumped by his fiancée

153
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:03,115
for a Tae Kwon Do instructor.

154
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:05,238
Look, this may
sound crazy, but I...

155
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:06,582
I think I need to do this.

156
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:09,221
I think this is an experience
I need to have.

157
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:10,963
I'm going.

158
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,168
Me, too!

159
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:19,743
Guys

160
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,434
take a good look at this face,

161
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,008
because the next time you see it,

162
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:26,266
it will be disfigured
in the hottest possible way.

163
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:29,368
Because that's who I am...
I'm a man.

164
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:33,357
I like to fight and mix it up
and get all dirty.

165
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:36,844
Can you find
a wood hanger for this?

166
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,834
- What happened here?
- I know, right?!

167
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:46,245
Who's not looking at my toupee now?!

168
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:48,044
Look what we did to these guys!

169
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:49,545
- "We?"
- Yeah, "we."

170
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:51,546
Come on, man, we're a good team.

171
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,327
Nice work boys! We did it!

172
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:56,119
No you did it.
We didn't do anything.

173
00:07:58,036 --> 00:08:00,431
Sure, I just beat up
three guys by myself.

174
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,806
You guys. That's good.
You and you

175
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,744
free drinks for life.

176
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,091
He thinks we were in this fight
with him.

177
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:15,483
We were in this fight with him.

178
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:17,971
And now we are going to go in there
and tell everyone

179
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,965
the legendary tale
of how we beat up some guys.

180
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,818
And everyone is going to think
it's great

181
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,761
and everyone is going to sleep with me
again.

182
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:27,372
Dude, come on, no one is gonna
believe we were in a fight

183
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,416
- look at us.
- That's a good...

184
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:31,966
What are you doing?!

185
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,817
What I should've done a long time ago.

186
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:35,134
- What?
- I don't know,

187
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:38,796
I just hit myself in the eye!
I don't even know what I'm saying...

188
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:41,780
I throw an awesome right hook,
by the way.

189
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,950
Okay, are you ready?

190
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,864
- To go back in?
- No, for this.

191
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,547
God! You just punched me in the nose!

192
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:51,527
- Are you crying?
- Yes, I'm crying!

193
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:53,533
You just punched me in the nose!

194
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,781
That's going to swell up real good.
You're going to look like Owen Wilson.

195
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:58,027
Let's get back in there.

196
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,762
Okay, but just, let's just play
this down, okay?

197
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:03,185
I don't want this to turn
into a big thing.

198
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,609
<i>And Ted comes
and takes his shoe off!</i>

199
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,201
<i>Hits him in the mouth...</i>

200
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:10,294
Hey, there they are!
The guys that got my back!

201
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,913
You two got in a fight. Really?

202
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:28,414
Barney punched me
and himself in the face

203
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,333
to make it look like we got in a fight.

204
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,996
Come on, Marshall!

205
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,484
Look at your eye.

206
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:36,630
You look like a badass.

207
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,100
I'm surprised to see you had it in me.
You.

208
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,905
Had it in you.

209
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,017
Do you

210
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,233
want to touch it?

211
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:51,681
Oh, my God, it's warm!

212
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:55,303
Hey! Victory drinks!

213
00:09:56,292 --> 00:10:00,134
Free! Free! Free! Free!

214
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:01,700
$7.50.

215
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:04,114
Why do I have to pay?

216
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:05,916
'Cause you don't got my back.

217
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,648
- These guys got my back.
- You know what, Doug?

218
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:10,259
I will gladly pay.
And you know why?

219
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,804
Because that's what grownups do.

220
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:14,480
They pay for their drinks,
and they don't get into fights.

221
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,267
You know what I was doing, while you
guys were out there being immature?

222
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,329
- I'll tell you what I was doing.
- Your nails?

223
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:22,311
- I was doing...
- The relationship quiz

224
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:24,311
in this month's Cosmo?

225
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,341
- I was doing...
- Your best not to cry

226
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:29,593
when Big came back for Carrie at
the end of the Sex and the Citymovie?

227
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,103
Spoilers much?

228
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,520
- I'll tell you what I was doing...
- The captain of the football team

229
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:36,073
because he gave you his promise ring

230
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:39,269
and you look so pretty
in your open back Homecoming dress?

231
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:42,837
Sorry.

232
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:45,848
I hate those guys!

233
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:48,747
Acting like they're the manliest
guys in the universe,

234
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,437
like they're Crocodile
Dundee and David Hasselhoff.

235
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,853
Those are the manliest guys
in the universe?

236
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,726
I don't understand why they're getting
all this attention. I mean,

237
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:58,627
I'm the real hero here.

238
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:00,612
- Yeah, you are.
- I'm serious, woman.

239
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:02,364
Put it back in your pants.

240
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:07,744
You're the man every boy
should grow up to become

241
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,882
and every girl should marry.

242
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:12,103
You know what?

243
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,712
I have two kids in my class
who won't stop fighting.

244
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,687
If you come to school tomorrow and

245
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:19,525
tell them your story of choosing
the path of nonviolence,

246
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:21,656
it might really set them straight.

247
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:24,980
And save me having to get up early
to make a lesson plan.

248
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:26,897
All right.

249
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,407
I'll set them straight.

250
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,643
- You're a wuss.
- What?

251
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:36,745
Mahatma Panda and Martin Luther Koala
are telling you kids this story

252
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,649
- to illustrate...
- To illustrate that you're a wuss?

253
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:42,114
Why didn't you just fight those guys?

254
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,706
- Were you scared?
- What?

255
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:48,303
I wasn't scared!

256
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,372
I've been in plenty of fights, okay?

257
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:51,702
You're huge!

258
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:54,228
You must weigh like a thousand pounds.

259
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:59,498
First of all,
I'm wearing a baggy sweater,

260
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:01,931
and it has horizontal stripes.

261
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:03,950
And I also...
and I had a salty lunch...

262
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,239
And so I'm retain...
You know what? Shut up!

263
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:07,339
Wuss!

264
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,056
So,

265
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,210
you just beat those guys up?

266
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:19,608
Just?

267
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:23,691
Amanda, were it so simple.
You see,

268
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:26,456
hand to hand combat is about
so much more than just

269
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:29,214
administering brute force
on your opponent, right B?

270
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:31,993
- You know it!
- It's a science.

271
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,092
The sweet science, as it were.

272
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:38,587
Wait, I'm confused,
what did those guys do to deserve it?

273
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:41,179
Well, this may sound petty,

274
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:44,527
- but they sat in our booth.
- They sat in our booth.

275
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,359
- And nobody...
- Nobody.

276
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:47,883
Sits in our booth.

277
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,434
Are you going to beat those guys up?

278
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:01,243
Yes, we are going to beat
those guys up. Ted, come on.

279
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:07,196
You two. Our booth.

280
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:10,178
- Get out. Now!
- What are you doing?

281
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:12,108
Relax, we got Doug.
Big Doug's got our backs.

282
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,987
Yeah, Doug's not here tonight.

283
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:15,622
Can I get you guys anything?

284
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,759
Drinks? Cash?
Those two girls over there?

285
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,115
Are you Ted Mosby?

286
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:24,052
- Yeah, I am.
- And you're Barney Stinson?

287
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,602
They've heard of us.

288
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,200
It's cool, guys. We'll let you leave
with your asses unkicked.

289
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,216
This time. A'ight?

290
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:37,519
- What's... what's this?
- You've been served.

291
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:39,573
You're being sued for assault.

292
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:41,699
Enjoy your booth.

293
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,952
That was close.

294
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:55,946
Assault!
They're suing us for assault!

295
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,369
Okay, well, what's the penalty
for assault?

296
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,145
What, do I have to pay a fine?

297
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:01,658
Pick up trash on the highway?

298
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,061
'Cause I've done that before,
know what I mean?

299
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:05,374
I don't know.

300
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:06,570
<i>Actually, he did know</i>

301
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,204
<i>that the worst we were looking at
was a small civil settlement,</i>

302
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,923
<i>and probably no criminal charges.</i>

303
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,589
<i>But he was really pissed at us.</i>

304
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,833
I mean, you guys could be looking at
some serious prison time.

305
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:18,172
- Prison?!
- I can't go to prison!

306
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,575
I mean, I could get a lot
of reading done,

307
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:22,634
finally write some short stories.

308
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:24,147
Work out all the time.

309
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,713
Seriously, if I don't come out
of there completely ripped...

310
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:28,751
We can't go to prison!

311
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,908
People get shivved in the joint!

312
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,105
Plus the meals are really starchy.

313
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:38,482
Well, you guys should have thought
of that before you beat up those guys.

314
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,732
What if we didn't?

315
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:43,919
- Didn't what, Ted?
- Didn't beat up those guys.

316
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,960
What if Doug beat up those guys all
by himself

317
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,848
- and we didn't do anything?
- I knew it!

318
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:49,870
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

319
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,814
- You guys didn't throw a single punch.
- Well, I hit Ted and myself, so...

320
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:58,125
Well, who's the wuss now?
Answer:

321
00:14:58,295 --> 00:14:59,101
You guys.

322
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:01,083
Look, can you just help us
get out of this?

323
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,990
You know the old expression:
If you're not prepared to do the time

324
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,385
don't pretend to do the crime and laugh

325
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:10,085
and get free drinks and not stand up
for your friend who, incidentally,

326
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,151
has been in plenty of fights
with his brothers.

327
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:17,227
Look, you've got to help us out,
Marshall.

328
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:19,557
We're the Three Musketeers!

329
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:22,570
If I give up Ted,
how much time am I looking at?

330
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:30,180
I've been looking for you.

331
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:33,861
I got... tickets to this hockey game
tonight. It's stupid.

332
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,373
You want to go?

333
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:38,116
It might go kind of late, so,
maybe, after the game

334
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:39,483
we can grab a drink.

335
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:41,875
Get this. You know that fight?

336
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,587
These guys faked the whole thing.

337
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,108
I forgot! Tonight is no good.

338
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:58,238
I can't go to that hockey game
tonight, I got that...

339
00:16:17,165 --> 00:16:19,293
Good news...
I talked to the guys.

340
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:21,436
- What guys?
- The guys you didn't beat up.

341
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,521
They agreed to drop the lawsuit.

342
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:25,022
Lawyered.

343
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:26,723
What? They agreed to drop it?

344
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:29,610
I just explained that you two
are wusses.

345
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,533
We had a good laugh about that.
A good long laugh, actually.

346
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:35,578
I explained how you get a
mani/pedi once a month.

347
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:38,214
Weekly, Wolverine...
some of us care.

348
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,212
And how you played
the hammer dulcimer

349
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:43,730
in the Pre-Reformation Dance
Society at Wesleyan.

350
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,828
Did you at least tell them
we were one of

351
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:48,691
the premier Medieval chamber groups
in the Little Ivies?

352
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:49,735
I did.

353
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:51,751
And we all agreed
it was much more likely that

354
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:53,319
one guy beat up the three of them

355
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:56,252
than that you two had anything
to do with it, so...

356
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:57,934
Wait, so,

357
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:00,596
- so now they're only suing Doug.
- Affirmative.

358
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:02,956
Angry, irrational,

359
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:04,954
violent Doug,

360
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,116
who now knows we were the ones
who threw him under the bus.

361
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:10,221
They what?!

362
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:14,148
- Look, Doug, we can explain...
- Explain what?

363
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:17,387
Explain how you stabbed me
in the back right to my face?

364
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:18,858
Robin, I'm scared.

365
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:20,752
Is Doug seeing anyone?

366
00:17:20,922 --> 00:17:23,322
Are you seeing anyone?
You really should.

367
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,531
Doug, look, you don't understand,

368
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,856
you beat up those guys all by yourself.

369
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:31,333
It's true, all right? They had nothing
to do with it. I mean

370
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,408
look at these two.

371
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:36,259
It was all Ted!

372
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:40,601
- Look at this guy.
- Yeah, look at me!

373
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:42,511
He wouldn't last 5 minutes in a fight.

374
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,091
I think I could last at least five...

375
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:46,735
He's got the muscle definition
of linguini.

376
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,074
Linguini with meatballs maybe...
check it.

377
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,928
- Look!
- Don't.

378
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:55,498
Okay, you know what,
maybe it was

379
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:57,958
just me. Actually, you know what,
that makes a lot of sense.

380
00:17:57,988 --> 00:17:59,356
I tend to black out a lot.

381
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:02,047
Anyway, look,
I always got your back.

382
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:04,403
All I ask in return
is that you got mine.

383
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:05,862
But you know what?

384
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:07,202
You don't.

385
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,520
You can't be counted on.

386
00:18:10,682 --> 00:18:12,630
No wonder your fiancée left you.

387
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:16,588
<i>And here it is, kids,
the only fight I've ever been in.</i>

388
00:18:16,758 --> 00:18:19,119
<i>So what can I share
about the experience?</i>

389
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,420
<i>Well, for starters,
when you punch someone in the face,</i>

390
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,916
<i>it hurts your hand</i>

391
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:28,865
<i>a lot.</i>

392
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:33,081
<i>But what hurts even more than that?</i>

393
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,019
<i>This.</i>

394
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,744
And the next thing I remember
was waking up.

395
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:42,576
I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

396
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,429
<i>Turns out getting in a fight
was a terrible idea.</i>

397
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:48,237
And that's my story.

398
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:50,188
And what did you learn?

399
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:54,118
Well, I learned that fighting is bad

400
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:56,979
and you shouldn't do it ever.

401
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:58,817
Any questions?

402
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,769
Where do you find these people?

403
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:06,406
I know! Was there a big sale
at the wuss market?

404
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:07,576
Wuss!

405
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:12,522
<i>Of course, I didn't tell those kids
what really happened.</i>

406
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,518
Okay, I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

407
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:19,530
What happened?

408
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,850
This happened.

409
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:27,001
Holy crap!

410
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:29,473
<i>Turns out Uncle Marshall
and his brothers</i>

411
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:31,801
<i>did a little more than just roughhouse.</i>

412
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:39,529
Cocoa break!

413
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,981
Marshall looks good.
Has he lost weight?

414
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,499
Bitch, don't even.

415
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:55,931
<i>Kids, I'd love to leave you
with the message</i>

416
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,113
<i>that fighting is bad
and you shouldn't do it,</i>

417
00:19:58,215 --> 00:19:59,700
<i>but I know that's pointless.</i>

418
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,659
<i>So, I'll leave you with this:</i>

419
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:03,992
<i>Don't ever get in a fight
with Uncle Marshall.</i>

420
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,903
<i>That guy's freaking crazy.</i>

421
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,531
It is so good to be home.

422
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:15,987
Mom, Lily, fantastic job.

423
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:18,907
"Good food, good meat,
good God, let's eat." Right?

424
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:21,367
Okay, here we go. Goggles on.

425
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:29,279
All right, so,
you guys pass the plates.

426
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:31,373
Lily, you want white or dark meat?

427
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:34,017
Dark! Honey, please be careful.
