1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,295
<i>Kids, everyone has an opinion
on how long it takes</i>

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,443
<i>to recover from a breakup.</i>

3
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:07,384
Half the length
of the relationship.

4
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:09,419
One week for every month
you were together.

5
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:12,699
Exactly 10,000 drinks.
However long that takes.

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,346
You can't measure something
like this in time.

7
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:17,231
There's a series of steps.

8
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:21,032
From her bed to the front door.
Bam! Out of there. Next!

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,037
<i>But I think you start to recover
the moment you meet</i>

10
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:26,841
<i>that person who gets
you back in the game.</i>

11
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,437
<i>This is the story
of how I met that person.</i>

12
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:42,258
<i>Now, kids, if you want to go swimming,
you don't just dive in.</i>

13
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:44,601
<i>First, you dip
your toe in the water.</i>

14
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:57,740
<i>You check the temperature.
See how it feels.</i>

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,995
I'm Ted.

16
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:02,433
Vicky.

17
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:32,931
<i>And then you slowly wade in.</i>

18
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,738
I got left at the altar
a month ago.

19
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:36,205
<i>Or, you know, cannonball.</i>

20
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,067
It was a complete disaster
and ever since then,

21
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:42,053
I haven't been able to even
look at another woman.

22
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:46,026
Except for the old lady on the subway
who break-dances for nickels.

23
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,665
I don't look at her that way.
I just look at her.

24
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:50,872
I mean, it's an old lady
break-dancing.

25
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,543
And she is good.

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,260
I'm going to give her
a dollar next time.

27
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:58,764
Hey, let's pretend
I just said this:

28
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:01,978
These elevator rides have been
the highlight of my week,

29
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,601
and I'd love to see you again
friday night.

30
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,487
Not in the elevator.

31
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,889
At a restaurant, a nice one.

32
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,292
What do you say?

33
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,740
Yes.

34
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:30,182
<i>Kids, I walked in
on a lot of crazy stuff</i>

35
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:32,255
<i>at the old apartment over the years.</i>

36
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,358
Sorry, guys. I'm just going to go
with a bowl of fruit.

37
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:42,140
It's been 12 minutes!

38
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:48,483
- Drop it!
- You first!

39
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,120
Ike, why are you pointing
your gun at me?

40
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:53,059
- Don't use my name!
- Put the guns down, now!

41
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:01,115
<i>But one of the craziest things
I ever walked in on</i>

42
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:04,204
<i>happened when I was roommates
with your Aunt Robin.</i>

43
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:14,395
Who are you?!

44
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,879
Mitch.

45
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:19,838
What you doing, Mitch?

46
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,137
You must be the roommate.

47
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:23,631
I'm on a date with Robin.

48
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,932
She had to step outside
to take a call.

49
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:28,186
I guess her cell phone
doesn't work in here.

50
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:34,307
Robin... didn't use
the super secret signal.

51
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:37,030
We put this old takeout menu
on the doorknob.

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,583
Place went out of business.

53
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:39,942
Mr. Wang's...

54
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:42,810
Guess I don't have to explain
why that's funny.

55
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:44,830
I'm going to go.

56
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:49,140
When you leave,

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,704
take the seat cushion with you.
That's trash now.

58
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:55,660
I think that I am more than qualified
for the job.

59
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,587
My weaknesses?

60
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:59,612
I would say caring too much,

61
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:02,730
working too hard, and putting my career
in front of my love life.

62
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,516
Whoops, that last one was real.
What?!

63
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:12,917
Well, it appears our sweet, innocent,
little Robin has taken a lover.

64
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:15,233
A young blade
by the name of Mitch.

65
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:16,813
Her blind date?

66
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:19,892
Total bust. She's been sending me
text messages all night.

67
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:23,228
She just let him go upstairs
to use the bathroom a second ago.

68
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:25,185
Excuse me a minute.

69
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:31,896
Buddy, you are killing me. I'm kind of
in the middle of something here.

70
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,246
Middle of what?!

71
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:36,066
This is my move.

72
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:38,061
It's called, "The Naked Man."

73
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:39,555
"The Naked Man"?

74
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:40,907
Goes like this:

75
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:42,646
You're on a first date,

76
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:44,253
you've had a few drinks,

77
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:46,429
<i>you make an excuse to go up
to the girl's apartment.</i>

78
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:48,831
So, the bathroom's right there.

79
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,656
You know what,
I'm going to grab this.

80
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:55,517
<i>Then, once she leaves the room,</i>

81
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:58,276
<i>you strip down naked and wait.</i>

82
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,113
<i>When she comes back, she laughs.</i>

83
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,586
<i>She's so charmed by
your confidence and bravado,</i>

84
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:06,173
<i>she sleeps with you.</i>

85
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:10,894
There is no way that works!

86
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,423
Two out of three times.

87
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:15,899
- Two out of three times?
- Two out of three times.

88
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,804
You just have to pick your spot.

89
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:20,588
The Naked Man is best used
as a last resort,

90
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,208
kind of a Hail Mary on a

91
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:24,772
first date when you know
there's not going to be a second one.

92
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:26,572
How do you know there's not going
to be a second date?

93
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:28,814
- Ted, look at me.
- I'd rather not, Mitch.

94
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:31,459
Robin is way out of my league.

95
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm not smart,
funny or handsome.

96
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,921
And as you can plainly see,
there's nothing impressive

97
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:39,396
going on anywhere around here.

98
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:42,789
My only shot with a girl like Robin
is the element of surprise.

99
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,800
And, let's be honest,
a little pity.

100
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,514
It's shock and "aw."

101
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,063
This doesn't really work.

102
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:52,805
Two out of three times.

103
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,449
Guaranteed.

104
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,165
No way.

105
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:59,650
Two out of three times.
He guaranteed it.

106
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:00,996
Come on.

107
00:06:01,256 --> 00:06:03,263
There is no way that's going
to work on Robin.

108
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:05,675
She's going to walk in there,
take one look at that idiot

109
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:06,936
and send him packing.

110
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:08,771
She might kick his ass first.

111
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,463
She might get her gun
and shoot him.

112
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:16,986
Go, go!

113
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,383
My God!

114
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:21,683
It worked.

115
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:24,667
Mr. Wang's is back in business?!

116
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,793
The Naked Man works!

117
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,191
This is going to revolutionize
the one-night stand!

118
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,048
This is like the forward pass
in football.

119
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,990
The slam dunk in basketball.

120
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,887
The haircutting technique
where they hold it

121
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:43,828
between their fingers
and cut right above it.

122
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:45,362
It's a total game changer!

123
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:47,337
Barney, this guy slept with Robin,

124
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:51,401
who you claim to be in love with.
How can you be excited about this?

125
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,003
The Naked Man
is bigger than me and Robin.

126
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,867
All these years,

127
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,870
I have been busting my hump,

128
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,986
with my secret identities
and my tricks and my gadgets.

129
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,287
I mean,

130
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,712
I'm like Batman.

131
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:08,835
But this Mitch fellow, he's Superman.

132
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:11,206
He just rips off his clothes
and he's good to go.

133
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,663
What kind of gadgets
are we talking about?

134
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,990
So, this is what it's going to be like,
us living together? I come home,

135
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:20,854
and guys you're dating are just going
to be sitting on the couch, naked.

136
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,707
Well, I wish I could say no.

137
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,421
I still cannot believe the Naked Man
worked on you.

138
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:30,465
What can I say? Okay,
I went in there, and he was naked.

139
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:33,927
It was funny.
I laughed, he laughed.

140
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:38,145
And then it just kind of happened.
I don't know.

141
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:41,390
I call "slut!"

142
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:44,192
Excuse me?

143
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:46,270
I'm sorry, Robin, but you
hooking up with this guy

144
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,589
makes it seem like
the only thing standing

145
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:50,127
between you and sex is clothes.

146
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:54,053
I didn't just sleep with Mitch
because he was naked.

147
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:55,676
Then why did you sleep with him?

148
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:56,804
Because

149
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:57,904
he...

150
00:07:58,691 --> 00:07:59,691
He...

151
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:02,253
Because I care about Mitch.

152
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,799
A lot.

153
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,610
There was a... connection

154
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:08,736
of specialness.

155
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:10,074
Of

156
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,060
specialness and feelings.

157
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:13,846
It was because he was naked.

158
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:15,615
And I'm sorry, but I don't approve.

159
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:17,424
There is only one reason

160
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:20,228
to sleep with somebody,
and that is love.

161
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:25,239
Marshall's a big girl
because he believes in true love

162
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,998
and just finished reading The Notebook

163
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:29,657
because the secretaries bullied him
into joing Oprah's Book Club.

164
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,304
Fine! But you know I'm right.

165
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:35,088
Marshall, I love you, but there's lots
of reasons to have sex.

166
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,158
- Name one.
- I can name 50.

167
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,180
- You can't.
- Number one:

168
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,904
Last Thursday.

169
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:49,508
- Hey, Marshall, want to do it?
- I'm up.

170
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:55,321
You befouled our marital bed
because you couldn't get to sleep?!

171
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:56,773
You're the one who said,

172
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:59,743
"That shadow on the ceiling
looks like a scary toothless clown.

173
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,089
Good night, Lily."

174
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,780
Fine! That's one.

175
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:05,870
- But I defy you to name...
- I'm going to name 50.

176
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,079
There's "makeup" sex

177
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:09,840
"breakup" sex,

178
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:12,969
and "your friend just told you
about a new-position" sex.

179
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,157
You're welcome.

180
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,785
There's also "revenge",

181
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,167
"rebound",

182
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,839
"paratrooping."

183
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,778
You know, when you go out of town

184
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:24,228
but instead of getting a hotel room,
you go straight to a bar

185
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:25,841
with the sole intention
of hooking up

186
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,616
with a girl so you have
a place to stay.

187
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:29,165
Oh, you mean "banging for roof."

188
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,357
Slut!

189
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:32,767
I don't do it.
My college roommate did it.

190
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:34,923
No, Robin,
I just have a bad cough.

191
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,993
I don't really have a bad cough.

192
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:41,526
We all know "college roommate"
means you, slut!

193
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:43,780
Does anyone have a lozenge?

194
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:48,506
I've got one.
"Nothing good on television" sex.

195
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:50,759
"Hotel room" sex.

196
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,075
"Curiosity,"

197
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:53,326
as in...

198
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,852
"I've always wondered what it's like
to have sex with a really tall girl."

199
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:58,116
Not a big girl,

200
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:00,372
just a tall girl.

201
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:02,389
Like

202
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,309
if a normal girl

203
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:06,175
were seven,

204
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,369
seven-and-a-half-feet tall and

205
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:12,482
wore a denim miniskirt.

206
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:15,248
I would have to know
what that is like.

207
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:18,713
32 reasons later...

208
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:20,114
"He said he loved you,

209
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:22,479
"but you're not ready to
say it back yet" sex.

210
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:23,579
Forty-three.

211
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:25,645
"Wingman diving on
the friend grenade."

212
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:26,958
Forty-four.

213
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:29,438
"The condoms are
about to expire."

214
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,108
Forty-five.

215
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:37,204
This is getting a little hard.

216
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,304
Forty-six!

217
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:43,737
Okay, four more to go. Ooh!

218
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:45,891
"You dropped a Cheeto on his lap

219
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:49,184
"and when you reached for it,
he thought you were making a move,"

220
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:51,212
"so you just went with it."

221
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,731
Thank you for ruing the memory
of our six-month anniversary.

222
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:56,300
You got me Cheetos.

223
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:59,540
Can we just stop
with this stupid list?

224
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,052
You guys are making me sad.

225
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:02,990
No, I'm having fun.

226
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,399
Man, this whole "one-partner"
thing sucks sometimes.

227
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,480
I'm always talking about you.

228
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,164
I can't play "I never" because

229
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:13,519
then everyone would know all the
weird stuff I let you do to me.

230
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:17,145
The only weird thing I ever did to you
was open up my heart and soul

231
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:20,104
when all I had to do was strip naked
while you were out of the room.

232
00:11:20,204 --> 00:11:22,914
I didn't sleep with Mitch
because he was naked!

233
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,233
Mitch and I
have something special.

234
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,715
I mean, fingers crossed, guys.
He may be the one.

235
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:30,418
The one?!
Mitch?! The Naked Man?!

236
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:32,327
You mean the naked genius.

237
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:35,951
All these years I've been suiting up
when I should have been suiting down.

238
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:40,903
That's it. I am doing The Naked Man
tonight. Ted, so are you.

239
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:42,504
- What?
- With the elevator girl.

240
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:44,726
You're going out with her
tonight, right? Naked Man!

241
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:46,626
No. Barney, come on,
this is the first girl

242
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:48,577
I've had the courage
to ask out since Stella.

243
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:49,722
Naked Man!

244
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:52,084
No, Barney, this is the eighth
outfit I tried on tonight!

245
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:54,974
I got my hair cut three times!
I'm a nervous wreck!

246
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:56,821
Are you wearing makeup?

247
00:11:58,054 --> 00:11:59,207
It's not makeup!

248
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:01,991
Iit's a sunscreen
with a subtle tint of...

249
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:04,559
It's made for men.

250
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,743
Sue me, I want my eyes to pop.

251
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:11,250
Naked Man!

252
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,982
No, Barney, I like Vicky.

253
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:14,639
This could actually
go somewhere.

254
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:16,885
I don't want to do anything
stupid to jeopardize it.

255
00:12:17,056 --> 00:12:19,625
Well, I really like

256
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,986
that girl,

257
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,461
but... Oh, I didn't see her
from the back.

258
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:25,751
I really like

259
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:27,206
that girl.

260
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:30,453
And I'm willing to jeopardize
our future together

261
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:32,457
for one night of glory.

262
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,337
Naked Man!

263
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,486
<i>So, that night, we all set out
to prove something.</i>

264
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:40,829
<i>Robin wanted to
defend her honor.</i>

265
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:43,825
Mitch, hey baby, it's me.

266
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:45,745
Robin.

267
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:48,750
Do you want to grab
some dinner tonight?

268
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:51,832
Because you're
basically my boyfriend!

269
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:55,119
<i>Lily needed to prove that
she could finish her list.</i>

270
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:59,171
I'm stuck. I can't think
of the last two.

271
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,385
Reason number 48:

272
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:06,238
To reinforce good behaviors
such as shaving and dental hygiene.

273
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:08,146
Oh, now you're
conditioning me? Great!

274
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,733
That explains why I always get
an erection when I floss.

275
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,404
<i>I had to prove that as scary
as it was to be dating again,</i>

276
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,165
<i>I was over Stella and ready
to get back out there.</i>

277
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:21,607
<i>And Barney needed to prove that he,
too, could pull off The Naked Man.</i>

278
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:23,956
Hey, thank you for letting me
look at your aquarium.

279
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:26,252
- You're a real life saver.
- Sure, no problem.

280
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,991
I just need to use the bathroom
and I'll be on my way.

281
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,718
Ted, I'm doing it.

282
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,672
I'm doing the Naked Man!

283
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,215
Me, too!

284
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:43,629
You...

285
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:49,085
I'm doing it!
I'm doing The Naked Man!

286
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:50,349
That's great!

287
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:52,261
What made you change your mind?

288
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,429
The date with Vicky
started off okay, but,

289
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,024
it didn't go as well as I hoped.

290
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:58,891
Oh, my God!
Ted, you are so funny!

291
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:02,567
And can I just say,
you have amazing eyes.

292
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,851
What, these old things?

293
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:07,286
Oh! Nice job, hot shot.

294
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:08,958
- I'm sorry...
- Save it!

295
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,815
Go tell the manager
he owes us an appetizer.

296
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:13,818
One of the ones with shrimp!

297
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:15,773
You're welcome. You were saying?

298
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,823
And then his cane
missed the top step,

299
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:23,126
and he was falling, for,
I swear, like two minutes.

300
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,832
God, I love old people.

301
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,617
Once I realized there was no
possible future in this relationship,

302
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,087
I just decided to go for it.

303
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,205
Awesome! Okay, big question:

304
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:39,844
What pose will you display
your Naked Man in?

305
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:43,541
That is a big question.
I hadn't really thought about it.

306
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:45,641
I was thinking the Superman.

307
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:50,203
What about the Captain Morgan?

308
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,189
How about the
"Oops, I didn't see you there"?

309
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:58,296
The Thinker?

310
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:01,700
What about the Heisman?

311
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:03,934
Mr. Clean?

312
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,661
The Burt Reynolds.

313
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:17,558
It's so great to see you again.

314
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,481
I really had a
great time last night.

315
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:31,770
So, what is it like
managing a C.P.K.?

316
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,428
I mean, who's idea was it
to put a pineapple in the...

317
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,359
Okay, stop right there.
I know what this is.

318
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:40,238
I've been on this date before.
This is the "I'm not a slut" date.

319
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:42,968
What? That's crazy.

320
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,965
Usually you read me so well,
but this time you're wrong.

321
00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:48,922
Come on, Robin. One of us
had a good time last night,

322
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:50,424
and we both know it was me.

323
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:53,055
Oh, Mitchell... Something,

324
00:15:53,155 --> 00:15:55,336
that is, that is just not true!

325
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,129
Really? How was the sex?

326
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:58,506
I didn't hate it.

327
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,839
Robin, you've seen my move.

328
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,219
That's it.

329
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,595
I have nothing else
to offer you.

330
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:07,333
I'm broke, I sweat when I eat,

331
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,774
and I'm in, like, five different
fantasy football leagues.

332
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,387
It's all I talk about.

333
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,398
Trust me, you don't want
to be around that.

334
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:15,726
What? Yes, I do!

335
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,442
Look, I didn't just sleep with you
because you were naked.

336
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,821
Yeah, you did.

337
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:22,255
And now you're trying to
pretend it was something more

338
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,865
to make yourself feel better.

339
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:25,736
Say what you will,

340
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:28,035
at least The Naked Man
is honest.

341
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:32,324
What about the old
"Coppertone Baby"?

342
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:38,004
The Olympic gymnast
who stuck the landing.

343
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:39,516
Hup!

344
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:42,075
I got to go.

345
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:43,218
Naked Man!

346
00:16:46,814 --> 00:16:48,567
You have a really nice place!

347
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,469
Oh, thanks! Coming from you,
that's a real compliment.

348
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:54,078
I just love that you're an architect,
it's so fascinating.

349
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:57,754
I could listen to you talk about
structural design all night.

350
00:16:58,624 --> 00:17:00,610
<i>And then I noticed,
lying on her end table,</i>

351
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,878
<i>a book of love poems
by Pablo Neruda.</i>

352
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:05,612
<i>The same edition
I'd had since college.</i>

353
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,712
<i>And it was bookmarked
to my favorite poem.</i>

354
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:12,709
<i>Maybe I was all wrong
about this girl.</i>

355
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:14,842
<i>Maybe there was a future for us.</i>

356
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,068
Crap!

357
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,359
Here we go.

358
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,857
Pablo Neruda.

359
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,648
Oh, yeah,

360
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:31,515
that book's a turd.

361
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:35,102
Some douchey guy I hooked up with
left it here. It's all in Mexican.

362
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:38,331
You know who writes good poems?

363
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:39,193
Jewel.

364
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:42,196
Her teeth are crooked
and she lived in a car.

365
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,963
- So, she has stuff to write about.
- Ta-dah!

366
00:17:58,676 --> 00:17:59,676
Okay.

367
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:02,990
The Naked Man works!

368
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,493
I just had decent sex with
an awful human being.

369
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:08,067
- I am back!
- Congratulations, buddy.

370
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:11,233
You're not the only one who
rocked The Naked Man tonight.

371
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:15,059
You just want to do it
to change the subject.

372
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,490
Yeah.

373
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,392
Hey, that's number 49!

374
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:20,398
Did it work?

375
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:23,327
It's like I just flossed.

376
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:24,860
I love you.

377
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:27,114
That's 50.

378
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:28,741
Oh, yeah...

379
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,467
Nice! What pose did you go with?

380
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,260
I went with "I've got boobs."

381
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,496
And she nailed it.

382
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:38,183
Oh, my God! Guys, guys, guys!

383
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,283
This is him!

384
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:40,836
This is The Naked Man!

385
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,866
Ted, his name is Mitch.

386
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:43,773
And,

387
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,296
he's my boyfriend. So...

388
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:47,399
It's okay, Robin.
I no longer call "slut."

389
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:51,012
- Okay. You can go. We're done.
- Thanks.

390
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:53,728
Hold on, Mitch, Mitch,
I have to thank you.

391
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,740
We all tried
The Naked Man tonight.

392
00:18:56,951 --> 00:18:58,911
We should see how Barney did.

393
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:05,026
- Hello?
- Hi, is Barney there?

394
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:06,226
No.

395
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:08,988
Oh, my God!
What's the matter with you?!

396
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,088
Get out!

397
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,874
I just have to grab my suit.
It's very expensive. The tie alone...

398
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:14,970
Get out of here right now!
Get out!

399
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,485
- You sick son of a bitch!
- Call me.

400
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:21,208
And if I see him again,
I'm calling the cops.

401
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:26,772
Two out of three times.

402
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,536
Mitch, I want you to know,
this night,

403
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,093
crazy as it was,

404
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:34,026
it got me out of my shell.

405
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,024
That's the beauty of
The Naked Man.

406
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:38,922
It gives you exactly what you need.
No more,

407
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:40,365
no less.

408
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,117
Now, if you'll excuse me,

409
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,875
I need to replace one of
my fantasy football quarterbacks.

410
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:48,382
He separated his shoulder!

411
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:54,211
A toast

412
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:55,982
to Mitch.

413
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:01,040
By the sum of his parts,
he is just a man.

414
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:05,139
But by what he does with those parts,
he becomes so much more.

415
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,994
<i>He may not fit society's
definition of a hero,</i>

416
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:10,178
<i>but he is the hero I needed.</i>

417
00:20:10,278 --> 00:20:12,497
<i>The hero who helped me
recover from the disaster</i>

418
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:15,377
<i>of my failed almost-marriage
and get back into the game.</i>

419
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:16,941
<i>He lives in the shadows.</i>

420
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,090
<i>Is he a dream?</i>

421
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,460
<i>Truth? Fiction?</i>

422
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,276
<i>Damnation? Salvation?</i>

423
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:24,547
<i>He is all these things and
none of them. For he is...</i>

424
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:26,483
<i>"The Naked Man."</i>

425
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,640
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

426
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:44,269
Oh, thank God.
