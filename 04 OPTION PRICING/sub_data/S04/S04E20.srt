1
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:05,546
- I heard this great joke at work.
- Dude, come on.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,759
She's not gonna like it.
It's boy-funny. It's not girl-funny.

3
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,581
That is sexist!

4
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:12,534
Funny is funny, Ted.

5
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:14,598
Lily's cool.
She'll appreciate this.

6
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:18,009
- You're on your own, man.
- Just tell me the joke.

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:19,379
Okay. Ready?

8
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:22,034
Lily, what's the difference

9
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:24,316
between peanut butter and jam?

10
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,285
- See? It's funny.
- It's boy-funny.

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,738
- She's not gonna like it.
- Why don't you let me decide?

12
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,242
What's the difference
between peanut butter and jam?

13
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,621
<i>And then Barney said the punch line.</i>

14
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,725
<i>To this day,
it's still the dirtiest joke</i>

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,710
<i>I've ever heard in my life.
And no, I'm not gonna say it.</i>

16
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:46,587
Yeah, I can't hang out
with you anymore.

17
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:48,924
Oh, come on.

18
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,459
That's a funny joke. That...

19
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:53,929
Told you.

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,596
She'll be back.

21
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,746
<i>And we didn't see Lily
for four weeks.</i>

22
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,927
<i>Kids, after getting laid off,</i>

23
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:16,971
<i>I was finally pursuing
my lifelong dream:</i>

24
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:19,390
<i>Starting my own architecture firm.</i>

25
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:21,150
<i>All I needed was some clients.</i>

26
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,998
I think it's so great that
you're striking out on your own, Ted.

27
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:25,563
- I admire that.
- Thanks.

28
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:28,429
And thanks for being so cool
with me using the apartment.

29
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:30,902
Yeah, of course.
Anything you need.

30
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:34,739
Small thing, do you mind not watching
television during business hours?

31
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:37,089
- This isn't working!
- I'm sorry. It's just, I...

32
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:39,492
I can't concentrate
while <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> is...

33
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:41,829
A penny saved
is a Penny Marshall! Yes!

34
00:01:42,504 --> 00:01:46,040
Ted, I know you're nervous,
but you've got to stop procrastinating.

35
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:50,158
You've spent the last two days choosing
the official pen of Mosbius Designs.

36
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:52,720
I've made some progress!

37
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,595
I've eliminated felt-tip.

38
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:58,429
Who am I kidding?
Felt's back in the ballgame.

39
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:02,515
Hey. You hear there's gonna be
more layoffs?

40
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,758
I know. I'm freaking out.

41
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,165
- Are you worried?
- Are you kidding?

42
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:10,752
The things I know about this company.
I won't ever be fired.

43
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:12,422
There's a pretty good chance one day

44
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:14,587
I'll wash up on shore
with no fingerprints or teeth,

45
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,195
but I won't be fired.

46
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,865
I wish I had your confidence.

47
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:22,078
Look, you just need a way to make
yourself absolutely essential.

48
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:24,537
Well, I work harder
than anyone in my division.

49
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:27,763
Yeah. Keeping your job has
nothing to do with hard work.

50
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:29,877
- You need a thing.
- What do you mean, a thing?

51
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,565
You know, something

52
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,005
that makes you fun
and well-liked, like Marcus Denisco.

53
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:36,860
<i>Marcus Denisco worked
in account services</i>

54
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,470
<i>and was perhaps the most expendable
employee at the company.</i>

55
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:42,764
I brought some donuts.
They're probably stupid.

56
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:44,684
<i>But eventually,
he came to be known as...</i>

57
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,602
Food Guy!

58
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,303
Who wants some pulled pork?
Of course you do! Come on!

59
00:02:50,624 --> 00:02:52,066
I love Food Guy.

60
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:55,319
They could never lay him off.
You know what I love about Food Guy?

61
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:57,905
- He always has food.
- He always has food.

62
00:02:58,073 --> 00:02:59,636
See? That's what you need.

63
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:02,201
You need that thing
that makes you a guy.

64
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:04,917
I have that thing
that makes me a guy.

65
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,201
Maybe even a guy and a half.

66
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,419
Not that thing.
You know, a thing. Like Toy Guy.

67
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:13,169
Guys, bad news.

68
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,619
As your HR rep,

69
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,925
I got to review the new overtime
scheduling policy with you.

70
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:22,602
The good news is we're gonna do it
while wearing Wolverine claws!

71
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:26,684
Section 5A:

72
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:28,768
Overtime will no longer be paid

73
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:30,521
at time and a half.
This is awesome!

74
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:31,689
Claw five!

75
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,774
I love Toy Guy.

76
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:36,544
See? You need a thing.

77
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:38,237
Like YouTube Clip Guy.

78
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:46,911
You're right.

79
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,571
I do need a thing.

80
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:50,489
But choose wisely.

81
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:52,625
You don't want
to be Creepy Back Rub Guy.

82
00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:56,589
Don't fill up. Food Guy's
got panna cotta in his office.

83
00:03:58,484 --> 00:03:59,484
Hey, buddy.

84
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,394
Hey, Douglas.

85
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,806
You're so tight.

86
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,517
I was relaxed about two seconds ago.

87
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:13,826
You're next.

88
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:18,651
Hi. Welcome to Mosbius Designs.

89
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:23,656
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm PJ, Mr. Mosby's assistant.

90
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:27,227
- What the hell is going on?
- I'm sorry. We do <i>not</i> interrupt

91
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:29,120
Mr. Mosby during
his brainstorming hour.

92
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:31,309
<i>It's okay, PJ. That's Robin.</i>

93
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:32,684
<i>She lives here.</i>

94
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,251
<i>I'm sorry for the disturbance, sir.</i>

95
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:37,218
Do you need anything else?

96
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,673
- I wouldn't say no to a cup of coffee.
- You're right there!

97
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,887
So now, Ted has an assistant
to help him not do anything.

98
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:47,438
PJ's been a huge help to me,

99
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:49,886
setting up the office,
designing the Web site.

100
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:52,603
And in return, I'm mentoring
a bright young mind.

101
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:54,562
Yes, the mentoring.

102
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:56,981
I want you to go outside
today and simply

103
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:59,819
put your hands on buildings.

104
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,946
All right? Feel

105
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:03,825
the concrete pulse.

106
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:08,341
Listen... Listen to the stories
the stones are telling you.

107
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:11,996
And pick up my dry cleaning.

108
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:13,436
I will.

109
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:16,853
- Thank you so much, Mr. Mosby.
- All right.

110
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,967
This table just told me
you're a douche.

111
00:05:25,002 --> 00:05:27,589
This whole mentoring thing
is just another way to procrastinate

112
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:30,709
- from actually calling clients.
- I'm not procrastinating.

113
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,507
I just... I want everything
to be perfect, okay?

114
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,062
I only get one shot at this.

115
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,130
Fine, but PJ is not helping.

116
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,137
If Ted says that PJ
is important to the company,

117
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,571
then PJ is not going anywhere.

118
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:45,406
See? He's very valuable.

119
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:48,284
PJ's a guy?

120
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,870
PJ's not some hot chick
you're banging?

121
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:52,620
No, I'm mentoring him.

122
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:55,619
Mentoring.

123
00:05:56,531 --> 00:06:00,129
I mentored a young fellow once.
Even made him my wingman.

124
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,732
Then, one day, he hired an assistant

125
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:06,272
to work ten feet
from his bedroom who

126
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:08,925
get this... isn't a hot chick,

127
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,352
proving he never listened
to a word I said.

128
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,349
And do you know
that young man's name?

129
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:17,513
Maybe. I don't remember.

130
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:20,280
Because he is dead to me!

131
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,736
PJ's gonna be getting
a very confusing card in the mail,

132
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,585
along with a garment
that he should by no means wear

133
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,121
for three days
and then mail back to me.

134
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:42,082
I thought of a "thing"
to make me more essential here.

135
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,133
I'm Eco Guy, 'cause everybody loves
a guy who recycles, right?

136
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,135
Fired. What else you got?

137
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,803
I thought of a few others:
Wacky Tie Guy.

138
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:53,264
- Fired.
- Daily Fun Fact Guy?

139
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:55,184
Did you know that you're fired?

140
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:57,603
I Know a Good Stretch for That Guy?

141
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,480
Downward-facing fired.

142
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:00,980
Monty Python Guy?

143
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,970
We are the knights who say...

144
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:04,245
You're fired.

145
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,857
Wait! Wait! I did used to run

146
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:09,113
a fantasy baseball league
back in law school.

147
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,826
That's not bad.
You might be on to something.

148
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:14,899
Awesome. Awesome!
I'll be Fantasy Guy!

149
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:18,008
We'll have to make you Sports Guy.
We already have a Fantasy Guy.

150
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,283
- What's up, bros?
- Hey, Frank.

151
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,077
Hello?

152
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,611
Where are you?
You're never late.

153
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:33,965
You're on top
of the Empire State Building?

154
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:38,124
Listen to the old gal.
She's got some stories to tell.

155
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:40,412
Take all the time you need.

156
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,901
Wait a second. "Ted Mosby Home".

157
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:50,906
Oh my God, the call is coming
from inside the house.

158
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:03,584
That's not
the Empire State Building.

159
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,206
Robin, you cannot sleep
with my assistant.

160
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:16,343
I'm trying to run a business here.
How did this even happen?

161
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:19,962
Well, at lunch, when you go
on your wisdom walks,

162
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:22,507
it gives me and PJ
some time alone together.

163
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:25,832
Inspiration... do your thing.

164
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:27,262
It always does, sir.

165
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:28,972
It always does.

166
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:35,687
Hey, PJ, I actually have
an architectural question for you.

167
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:37,314
How does Ted's ass taste?

168
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,155
I wouldn't know, but I assume
it tastes like genius.

169
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,375
Why is the bathroom locked?

170
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,952
Visitors need to sign in
for the bathroom key.

171
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:55,332
Listen, Peej, and I want you to think
this over real good

172
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:58,126
before you answer.
Are you telling me that I can't

173
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:00,420
go to the bathroom in my apartment?

174
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:04,910
I am telling you that you need
to ask permission

175
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:07,552
to use the bathroom in my office.

176
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:09,805
Why is that so hot?

177
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:14,200
There are billions
of guys in the world.

178
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:15,936
Why do you have to sleep with him?

179
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:18,693
Ted, when I get off work,
it's 5:30 in the morning.

180
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:20,818
Do you have any idea
what kind of guys I'm meeting?

181
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:25,586
I deliver newspapers. It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

182
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,242
Don't worry. I'll wash them
before I handle your business.

183
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:35,469
I live with my mom.
At night, we watch TV in her bed.

184
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:37,457
We call it "Cuddle Club".

185
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:42,586
So, you, get up really early to trade
on the European stock exchanges?

186
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,172
What's that like?

187
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,091
Look, is this going
to happen or not?

188
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:50,278
Okay, first of all,
I've hung out with Fantasy Guy.

189
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:52,514
You could do a lot worse.
Secondly,

190
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:54,133
this has to stop.

191
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:56,435
Distracting PJ is going
to kill our productivity.

192
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:59,938
What productivity? You haven't
even called a single client.

193
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:02,155
Once I get the Web site up,

194
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,748
the brochures printed,
and figure out what trusts games

195
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:08,572
we're going to play at the corporate
retreat, I am making those calls.

196
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:10,031
Corporate retreat?

197
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,534
Mr. Mosby and I are going camping
on the roof.

198
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:18,206
Hey, Sports Guy. I hear people
are raving about your league.

199
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,405
It's a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

200
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,563
Between entry fees
and transaction fees

201
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,668
and penalty fees, I'm actually...

202
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:26,423
I'm holding on to a lot of money.

203
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:28,300
Great work, Sports Guy.

204
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:29,901
That's for last week.

205
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:34,991
<i>60,</i>

206
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,371
<i>80, a hundred.</i>

207
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:40,821
<i>This is $18,000 cash.</i>

208
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:43,208
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

209
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,067
<i>I'll just take it home
and put it somewhere safe.</i>

210
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,647
<i>Okay, just walking down the street</i>

211
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:50,614
<i>with some money in my pocket.</i>

212
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,023
<i>Don't touch the money.</i>

213
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:54,115
<i>That's so obvious. Just be cool.</i>

214
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:59,257
<i>The baby's on to me.
Babies can smell money.</i>

215
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:00,499
Everyone knows that!

216
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,292
I'm carrying a lot of money!

217
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,970
Seriously, dude,

218
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:07,756
I'm not sure how much longer
I can keep doing this.

219
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,435
Marshall, last week you were trash

220
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,178
that no one wanted to look at.
Now, you're Sports Guy.

221
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:15,430
- I was trash?
- Last week!

222
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,643
There's Ted Mosby
of Mosbius Designs.

223
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:21,827
How's the home office coming, buddy?

224
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,774
It was going great till Robin started
banging my assistant.

225
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:31,580
It's our apartment, okay? You leave
a big chocolate cake on the counter,

226
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,365
Mama's gonna cut her off a slice.

227
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:35,330
I told you.

228
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:38,141
Hire a cute assistant
that you can sleep with,

229
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,786
but instead you hire a cute assistant
that Robin can sleep with.

230
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:44,268
And of course he's gonna sleep with her.
She's the greatest woman on the planet!

231
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:46,333
I'm getting off topic!
You're an idiot!

232
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,380
That's my message!
You're an idiot!

233
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:56,051
One person storming off isn't enough!
Marshall, storm off with me!

234
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,646
Dude, why are this upset

235
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:07,065
about Ted not having sex
with the people he hires?

236
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:08,593
Because it hurts!

237
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:13,126
- It hurts you how?
- It hurts because I love...

238
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:14,714
Ted.

239
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,377
Having sex with women.

240
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,002
I'm a very dedicated wingman!

241
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:22,073
Look, Lily's the only person
that I can talk to about this stuff.

242
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:23,488
Just get her to talk to me.

243
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:25,417
I'll try, but there's no guarantees.

244
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,378
She's still really outraged
about that joke.

245
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:31,467
That joke.

246
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:33,633
Torn our little group apart,

247
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:36,011
pitted people I love
against each other.

248
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:37,718
Seriously, I wish...

249
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:40,765
I wish that joke had never come
into our lives.

250
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,054
- It's kinda of funny though, right?
- It's so funny, man.

251
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:48,857
Hey, good news, PJ.

252
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:52,512
The brochures you designed just came in.
Really interesting choice for the cover.

253
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:55,084
I like how instead of one
of my designs,

254
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,561
you chose this.

255
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,242
You know what?

256
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:00,493
I must've sent in the wrong photo.

257
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:01,787
You think?

258
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:05,248
Look, PJ,
the Web site's still not done.

259
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:07,787
You didn't even show up
to the corporate retreat

260
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,220
by the way, I saw a shooting star,

261
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:14,721
and you're late every day.
I'm sorry, PJ. I gotta get focused.

262
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,394
- You're fired.
- You can't fire...

263
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,512
PJ, you're fired.

264
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:20,689
Fine!

265
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:25,358
Hey, baby.

266
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,580
I just got fired.

267
00:13:28,794 --> 00:13:30,877
Yeah, I'll wait for you
at your place.

268
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:35,736
<i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

269
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:43,987
I love having all this free time
to spend with you.

270
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:46,544
I'm going to kiss you here...

271
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:48,261
And here.

272
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:50,047
And here and here.

273
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:51,536
And...

274
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,998
- One more.
- Please stop.

275
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:57,618
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll miss you.

276
00:13:57,743 --> 00:13:59,311
I'll miss you, too.

277
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:07,093
- You're already sick of him.
- He's driving me crazy.

278
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,955
When PJ had a job, he was sexy.

279
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,999
He was guardian of the bathroom key.

280
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:16,465
A hot guy telling you
when you can and can't pee?

281
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:18,595
That's the dream.

282
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,655
"That's the dream"?

283
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,872
The dream?

284
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,219
Like what Martin Luther King
was talking about?

285
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,228
I have to end it, don't I?

286
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,364
I'm terrible at breakups.

287
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,826
I still have to go a little bit, but
I couldn't be away from you 1 s longer.

288
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,306
Listen...

289
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:36,706
Dude, I don't know.

290
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,725
- What?
- Yeah, it's just...

291
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:41,215
It's not really

292
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,531
ix-nay, you know?

293
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,007
Ix-nay on what?

294
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:48,409
Not feeling it.

295
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,112
Not feeling what?

296
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:51,637
But friends and stuff.

297
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:53,886
My God, this is
the worst breakup ever.

298
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:56,593
You're breaking up with me?

299
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:59,668
If that's what you want,
I totally understand.

300
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,533
You still haven't activated that
shortstop the Mariners just brought up.

301
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,089
Got to have it.

302
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,654
See, Sports Guy!
People love you.

303
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,604
I can't be Sports Guy anymore, okay?
It's killing me!

304
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,482
I keep getting
these constant texts and e-mails

305
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:18,620
and phone calls
in the middle of the night.

306
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:21,195
Sometimes I even think
that I'm being followed.

307
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:24,378
Hey, buddy.

308
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,081
I need you to push that trade through,
so I can set my new lineup.

309
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,622
You really carry it
in your shoulders, don't you?

310
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,247
Seriously, it's over.

311
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:35,666
Do you want me to stop?

312
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,137
<i>With Robin and PJ broken up,</i>

313
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:44,093
<i>I was free to make
some staffing changes in the office.</i>

314
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,861
Welcome to Mosbius Designs.

315
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,224
You got to be kidding me?

316
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:52,184
<i>And now that PJ was back at work...</i>

317
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:55,729
You got to be kidding me?

318
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:00,526
So, apparently Robin and PJ
are an item again.

319
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,433
You got to be kidding me!

320
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:07,399
Are you all right?

321
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,006
Since Lily's not talking to me,

322
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:13,131
there's something I have to tell you.
And this isn't easy to say, all right?

323
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:16,871
I'm... wait for it

324
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:19,670
in... wait for it

325
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:22,354
love... wait for it

326
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,482
with... wait for it

327
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:31,822
a... wait for it

328
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,555
- certain... wait for it...
- I know that you're in love with Robin.

329
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,255
- What?
- Lily told me.

330
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,757
She told you?

331
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,374
Great.

332
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,553
I bet you guys have been laughing at me
behind my back the whole time.

333
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:48,861
Actually, in a weird way,

334
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:51,490
we both think you're kind
of perfect for each other.

335
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:53,395
You do?

336
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:55,572
Matter of fact,
we even try to sit on the same side

337
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:57,663
of the booth so you two
will have to sit together.

338
00:16:58,034 --> 00:16:59,373
Really? That's so sweet.

339
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,325
But let's be clear.

340
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:06,046
I don't love her. Okay?
I just

341
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:09,655
miss her when she's not around.
I think about her all the time,

342
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,319
and I imagine us one day running towards
each other in slow motion,

343
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,122
and I'm wearing a brown suede vest.

344
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,608
Are you ever gonna tell her
how you feel?

345
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,017
Maybe. Never. I don't know. Look...

346
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,239
I just need to get
that PJ idiot away from her.

347
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:27,288
If Lily were here, she'd know exactly
how to get rid of him.

348
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,571
- Maybe I can help.
- Marshall, you're no Lily.

349
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:34,350
Lily is a diabolical puppet master,
subtly manipulating

350
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:37,168
every situation to get
exactly what she wants.

351
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:38,787
She's pure evil, Marshall.

352
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:42,318
You got a good one there.
Hang on to her.

353
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:46,912
<i>Meanwhile, my bizarre tug of war
with Robin over PJ continued.</i>

354
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,912
I was about to go on my wisdom walk.

355
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:52,341
Want to join me?

356
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:56,821
I took the bathroom key
without asking.

357
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,724
What are you gonna do about it?

358
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:00,786
Look

359
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:04,605
you guys are both great.
But the truth is I'm taking another job.

360
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:08,192
These are for you.
Robin, I hope this letter

361
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:09,735
offers some closure.

362
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:13,021
I'm really going to miss you.

363
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,527
You can't trade Manny Ramirez
for two middle relievers!

364
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:19,925
If you veto that trade,
I am out of the league!

365
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:21,914
I'll figure it out.

366
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:27,465
Hire the kid to be a "paralegal".

367
00:18:27,844 --> 00:18:31,048
He gets to do all the work,
and you still get to be Sports Guy.

368
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,592
Pure evil, Eriksen. Pure evil.

369
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,119
You okay?

370
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,753
What if I don't think of the books?

371
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:51,403
Excuse me?

372
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:54,252
There's this famous architecture story
about an architect

373
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:56,189
who designed this library.

374
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:57,977
It was perfect.

375
00:18:58,374 --> 00:19:01,109
But every year,
the whole thing would sink

376
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:02,828
a couple inches into the ground.

377
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:06,237
Eventually, the building
was condemned.

378
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:09,962
He forgot to account
for the weight of the books.

379
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:14,164
This company... it's just me.

380
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:18,177
What if I don't think of the books?

381
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:22,766
First of all, nobody goes to libraries
anymore, so who cares about that guy?

382
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:27,437
Secondly, you need to get
on the phone and start calling clients.

383
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:29,938
The longer I put off
starting my own firm,

384
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:31,633
the longer it can remain a dream

385
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:34,206
and not something I screwed up at.

386
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:37,572
It's like I'm giving up
before I even started.

387
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:40,358
You want to talk about giving up?

388
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,467
I used to describe my ideal guy as
"funny, smart,

389
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,258
"passionate, challenging".

390
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:48,703
And now, apparently,
I will settle for

391
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:50,135
"in my apartment".

392
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:54,134
Didn't you think you'd have it
all more figured out by now?

393
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:57,633
Are you kidding? By 30,
I was gonna be annoyingly successful,

394
00:19:57,758 --> 00:20:00,179
married to the perfect woman,
maybe a kid on the way.

395
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:03,922
Instead, I'm just some guy
sitting in his apartment,

396
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:06,447
having a staring contest
with his phone.

397
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:08,894
And losing.

398
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:13,192
You can take that thing.

399
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:32,992
Hi, this is Ted Mosby
of Mosbius Designs.

400
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:36,289
I'm calling to inquire about any design
needs you may have now or in the future.

401
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:38,675
- That sounds great.
- Really? I sound confident?

402
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,877
- Now call an actual client.
- Great.

403
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:47,677
Hey, Food Guy!

404
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,342
Hey, Toy Guy!

405
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:57,406
Who's that guy?

406
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:01,997
He doesn't work here.
I think we should leave the building.

407
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:04,249
- Really?
- This has happened before.
