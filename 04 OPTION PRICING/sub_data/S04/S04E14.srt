1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,460
I can't believe Metro News One is just
forwarding you all this fan mail now.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,529
I know.
I quit like four months ago.

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,804
You had more fans than I thought.

4
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:11,813
And only about 60% of them
are prison inmates.

5
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:14,100
What are these guys thinking?

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,505
I am way past
my "dating prisoners" phase.

7
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:19,306
It's like, hello, I'm not 19 anymore.

8
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:22,240
Lottery Girl's on.

9
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,988
I just feel sorry for these women.

10
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,615
This is where broadcast
careers go to die.

11
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,207
Check it out. I make it fun.
I invented a little game.

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,729
Tonight's Lotto numbers are

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,532
nineteen...

14
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:39,356
Age you moved to New York
after a photographer "discovered" you

15
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,840
at a food court and said
he'd get you in Vogue magazine.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,018
Fifty-three...

17
00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:44,705
Number of semi-nude pictures
he took of you

18
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:47,497
before you realized he had
no connection to Vogue magazine.

19
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:49,308
Twenty-two...

20
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,852
Age you claim you are.

21
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:52,236
Thirty-one...

22
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:53,772
Age you actually are.

23
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,466
Forty-five...

24
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:58,072
Number of minutes it would take
me to get you into a cab,

25
00:00:58,172 --> 00:01:00,488
out of your dress,
and into my Jacuzzi.

26
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:02,572
And the Super Big Ball is...

27
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:05,371
What happens after we get out
of the Jacuzzi.

28
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:06,509
What up?

29
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:23,317
<i>Kids, by the winter of 2009,</i>

30
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:25,494
<i>Robin had been
unemployed for months.</i>

31
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,523
<i>But there was a glimmer of hope.</i>

32
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,630
How'd the audition go?

33
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,140
Well, I went in there
feeling really good.

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,813
I heard it was just me
up against two other girls.

35
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:36,022
Listening.

36
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,253
And you are?

37
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:53,363
You've obviously never spent
any time in Denver.

38
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,600
Rochelle Harper, News Center 12.

39
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:58,757
We were only the number-one station
in the Rockies for

40
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:00,385
five straight years.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,529
I was an anchor here in town
at Metro News One.

42
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:05,301
An anchor.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,384
You must have a killer signoff phrase.

44
00:02:08,691 --> 00:02:09,560
I'm sorry?

45
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,556
You gotta have a killer signoff phrase.

46
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:13,417
Like Walter Cronkite.

47
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,648
"And that's the way it is."

48
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:17,292
So what's yours?

49
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:20,653
Well, I would just always end
with a simple.

50
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:23,983
"From all of us here at Metro News One,
have a good evening."

51
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:32,287
Mine is: "From all of us here
at Barney's apartment, get out."

52
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:36,791
You didn't let those reporter bitches
psych you out, did you?

53
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:41,378
and the President's economic team
is hoping to have a proposal

54
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,953
before Congress
by the end of the month.

55
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:47,947
From all of us here at News Ten,
have a good evening.

56
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:53,604
So, good night, New York.

57
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:56,698
And may the road ahead
be lit with dreams

58
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:58,257
and tomorrows.

59
00:02:59,615 --> 00:03:01,482
Which are lit with dreams

60
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:02,938
also.

61
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,103
That's terrible.

62
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,461
And bad

63
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:08,941
also.

64
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:10,691
I wasn't done.

65
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:13,700
Stand tall, New York.

66
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,335
Trustworthy.

67
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:16,938
Recycling.

68
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,846
Wear a condom.

69
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,227
Wear a condom?

70
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,921
I'm not gonna be the new
Channel Ten anchor, am I?

71
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:28,214
This just in.

72
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:32,861
Maybe the problem is your résumé.

73
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:35,133
See how mine is lean and mean?

74
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:36,646
Yours is too cluttered.

75
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:39,314
Like everything on your résumé
is so relevant?

76
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:43,395
"Program Director,
88.1 Wesleyan University Radio"?

77
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:45,317
- Oh, God.
- Dr. X?

78
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,781
You're still bragging about Dr. X?

79
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:50,181
- Who was Dr. X?
- Nobody knows.

80
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:53,197
- He was this genius mystery D.J.
- It was Ted.

81
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:55,735
His identity remains a secret
to this day.

82
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,930
It was Ted.

83
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,250
But this phantom of the airwaves changed
the very face of college radio.

84
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:02,594
- It was Ted.
- And your show sucked.

85
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:07,920
<i>Dr. X here, shooting truth bullets
at you from an undisclosed location.</i>

86
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,069
<i>Because if they knew where I was,
they'd shut me down.</i>

87
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,134
You're on the third floor
of the Student Center

88
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,194
next to the game room, you tool.

89
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:17,478
<i>I've been getting a lot of letters
about my segment</i>

90
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:20,233
<i>on how racist
the school's meal plan is.</i>

91
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,417
How are you getting letters
if no one knows where you are, douche?

92
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,202
<i>That's why I'm organizing a happening</i>

93
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:27,610
<i>outside the dining hall,
Monday at midnight.</i>

94
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,405
<i>It's high time the Food Service
puppet masters</i>

95
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:33,064
<i>took ignorance and injustice
off the menu.</i>

96
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:36,267
<i>Hey, Ted, we need
a fourth for foosball.</i>

97
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,897
<i>What are you doing in here, anyway?</i>

98
00:04:37,997 --> 00:04:40,377
<i>Dude, get out of here!
I'll be there in a second.</i>

99
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:43,532
<i>So remember, dining hall,
monday, midnight.</i>

100
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:45,854
<i>Another Dr. X happening.</i>

101
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:50,842
<i>I'll be there, because X
marks the spot-ot-ot-ot-ot...</i>

102
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:55,121
If you think people liked your show,
they did not-ot-ot-ot...

103
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:56,476
This is weird.

104
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,516
Look what got mixed in
with your fan mail.

105
00:04:58,616 --> 00:04:59,350
What?

106
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:01,915
It's from the
U.S. Department of Immigration.

107
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:05,523
It's postmarked two months ago.

108
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,530
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

109
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,235
It's about my work visa.

110
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:16,880
Unless I can find a job in the next

111
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,763
seven days,

112
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:21,147
they're gonna send me back to Canada.

113
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:31,193
I can't believe you might be
kicked out of the country.

114
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:33,688
I know. My whole life is here.

115
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,852
We won't let this happen. I mean,
one of us will help you find a job.

116
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:39,367
I bet I can get you something
at my school.

117
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:43,532
It doesn't work that way.
Robin only gets her work visa

118
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,688
if she gets a job in her field.

119
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,938
I mean, you know what,
I guess you could stay

120
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:49,841
if you married a U.S. citizen.

121
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:51,878
Yeah, that could work.

122
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:56,723
They could never process that and make
it official in time. That won't work.

123
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:57,902
I'm screwed.

124
00:05:58,002 --> 00:06:00,844
I've been sending out my reel
for three months, and nothing.

125
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,946
Well, maybe there's something in your
reel that people aren't responding to.

126
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:05,714
Let's take a look at it, right?

127
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:10,326
<i>That's a good question, Norm.</i>

128
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:12,842
The first thing is from
when I was a cub reporter

129
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,776
for Channel 22 in Red Deer.

130
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:16,745
In Alberta.

131
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,665
In Canada.

132
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,139
<i>Well, the snow's coming down
pretty hard,</i>

133
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:27,570
<i>but these intrepid fishermen
are still happy to be out competing</i>

134
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,556
<i>in Lake Athabasca's
Bass Fishing Jamboree,</i>

135
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:32,616
<i>an August 1st tradition.</i>

136
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,678
<i>Back to you, Norm.</i>

137
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:38,828
What?

138
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:41,931
That was my first job.
It shows where I came from.

139
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,165
Unless a bear attacks you
in the next three seconds

140
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:46,012
and you snap its neck
with your legs,

141
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:48,192
that has no business being
on your reel.

142
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,452
I get it, I get it.

143
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:53,026
Where you're from is part
of who you're selling.

144
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,338
For instance, under "special skills"
on my résumé,

145
00:06:55,438 --> 00:06:57,327
I mention that back in Minnesota,

146
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:59,828
I was the 1995 Nicollet County
Slam Dunk Champion.

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,421
You put dunk champion
on your résumé?

148
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:03,920
Yeah, why wouldn't you?

149
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,489
A lot of companies have
basketball teams.

150
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,128
It's good for them to know

151
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,531
that Vanilla Thunder can still take
the rock to the hole.

152
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:13,900
- They called you Vanilla Thunder?
- Yeah, Vanilla Thunder.

153
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:17,242
The Ghost in the Post.
The Human Turnstile.

154
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:19,386
I didn't... play that much D.

155
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:21,497
You can't still dunk.

156
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,068
Of course I can.

157
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,942
Well, I mean I could...
until... recently.

158
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,602
Until the injury.

159
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:30,281
It's called iliopsoas tendonitis.

160
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:31,972
Yikes, that sounds bad.

161
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:34,695
It's more commonly known
as dancer's hip.

162
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:40,085
Dr. Goodman...

163
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,083
Come on!

164
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:46,379
Iliopsoas tendonitis.
That's what it's called.

165
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,142
That's all it's called.

166
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:50,718
Iliopsoas tendonitis.

167
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:53,855
It's a basketball injury.
You know, it's no big whoop.

168
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,885
Dancer's hip, Marshall has something
called dancer's hip.

169
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:02,119
They only call it that, look, because
it's very common with ballet dancers.

170
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:07,886
So, tell me, do any of the other
little girls in your class

171
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,766
- have dancer's hip?
- Yeah, sure.

172
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,525
I have more of a technical question.

173
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,875
Is it easier to dance when
you don't have external genitalia?

174
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:17,647
Good, don't build to that...
just go right for it.

175
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,153
Guys, come on. Marshall didn't get
this injury from dancing.

176
00:08:21,323 --> 00:08:22,521
Thank you, Lily.

177
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:25,231
Clearly, the stirrups
were set a little too wide

178
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:27,281
during his last trip to the gyno.

179
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,300
Guys, I hate to cut you off

180
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,921
before Marshall bursts
into tears, but,

181
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,193
Robin, check this out.
What you need is an awesome

182
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:37,112
video

183
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:38,282
résumé.

184
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,114
Like... mine.

185
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,566
I present,

186
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,353
Barneysvideoresume.com.

187
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:08,365
<i>You've achieved great success
in business,</i>

188
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,837
<i>athletics and personal relationships</i>

189
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:13,710
<i>and have been an inspiration
to many people.</i>

190
00:09:13,982 --> 00:09:15,012
Is that you?

191
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,452
Are you interviewing yourself?

192
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:20,465
How can it be me?
That guy's British.

193
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:24,696
<i>What would you recommend
to your numerous admirers</i>

194
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:27,250
<i>who want to reach
their highest potential?</i>

195
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,336
And a wee bit Scottish.

196
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,009
The first thing you need
to know about success

197
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,100
is that it doesn't
just come to you.

198
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,349
Most people associate success
with money and power,

199
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,765
but really it's a state of mind.

200
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:45,978
You had to be on a motorcycle
to say that?

201
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:49,092
And when it comes to success
the only limit

202
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,117
is that there are no limits.

203
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:54,653
I didn't know you knew how to stand
near a horse, that's impressive.

204
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:57,950
Barney, I don't get it. You don't do
a damn thing in any of these clips.

205
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,954
Exactly.

206
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:01,025
Because that's who
corporate American wants

207
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,589
people who seem
like bold risk takers,

208
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:05,582
but never actually do anything.

209
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:08,049
Actually doing things
gets you fired.

210
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,411
In fact, I'm writing a book
on this very phenomenon.

211
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,274
Really, you're writing a book?

212
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:16,227
That would be doing some...
Are you even listening?!

213
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:18,266
All my life,

214
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:20,024
I have dared to go

215
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:21,840
past what is possible.

216
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:24,240
<I>To the impossible?</I>

217
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,408
Actually, past that

218
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:28,835
to the place where the possible

219
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:31,790
and the impossible meet
to become

220
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:34,560
the possimpible.

221
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:37,682
The possimpible? Really?

222
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:41,157
Inventing your own word shows
creativity and vision...

223
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:42,838
"Visiativity."

224
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,187
If I can leave you with one thought,

225
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:48,320
it's this.

226
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:50,423
Nothing,

227
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:52,190
and everything

228
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:54,179
is possimpible.

229
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,054
<i>That guy's awesome.</i>

230
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,624
Is that you agai...?

231
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,285
Are you singing a song
about yourself?

232
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:06,253
Absolutely not.
That would be lame.

233
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:11,509
<i>Stinson, Barney Stinson
singing this song.</i>

234
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,327
<i>That would be really lame.</i>

235
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:17,373
<i>One of the many admirers who
think that guy's awesome</i>

236
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:19,531
<i>perfect and available.</i>

237
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:43,381
That baby got me 11 job offers.

238
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:45,517
No way.

239
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:48,839
- That was ridiculous and insane.
- Insanulous.

240
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,651
- Make me one.
- What?

241
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:54,442
- Now you're talking.
- What?

242
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:57,227
I'm about to be deported.
I'll try anything.

243
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:58,668
We better get started.

244
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:00,836
There's a lot to shoot,
and I don't think I can use

245
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,655
any of the footage
I already have of you.

246
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,857
What footage do you
already have of me?

247
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,729
Let's just get started.

248
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:13,222
Sweetie. Are you still upset
about the dancer's hip jokes?

249
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:19,083
We were just kidding.
We all know it's a basketball injury.

250
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,539
Totally.

251
00:12:23,637 --> 00:12:25,999
Lily, I have something
I need to tell you.

252
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,160
What is it?

253
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,520
I dance more than you know.

254
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,209
What?

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,008
I dance

256
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,654
more than you know.

257
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:42,560
I don't know how to respond to that.

258
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:44,438
So,

259
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,453
what does being a reporter
mean to you?

260
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:50,900
Well, ever since I was a little kid,

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,430
- I always...
- Cut!

262
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:55,275
You're getting bogged down
in specifics.

263
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,044
I need you to just say vague,

264
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:01,884
confident-sounding buzzwords,
like "synergy" and "dynamism."

265
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:04,721
You can make up a word,
like... "linkativity."

266
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:08,643
How will sounding like an idiot
get me hired anywhere?

267
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,465
Okay, fine. Don't do it.

268
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,084
Anyway, I'm sure there are plenty of
exciting stories to cover back in Canada.

269
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:17,460
I just read that the mayor of
Winnipeg's nephew went ice fishing

270
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,624
and caught himself a 16-pound walleye.

271
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:23,430
Reporting live from the worst place
in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

272
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:25,233
Fine.

273
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,419
Roll camera.

274
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:31,980
- Connectitude.
- Love it.

275
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:35,135
- Transformatation.
- Earn it!

276
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:36,526
Linkativity.

277
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:39,317
Linkativity's mine.

278
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,356
So, how much dancing
are we talking about?

279
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:46,456
I don't...

280
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:48,331
I guess I'd say

281
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:50,446
medium.

282
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:54,373
Why are you dancing so much,
and why don't I know about it?

283
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:56,543
It's... something I do when I'm alone.

284
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:58,844
You know, like if something
good happens, I get excited

285
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:00,393
and I need to move, and I just...

286
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:03,702
I don't know. I don't want
to even talk about this anymore.

287
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:06,382
So that's how you injured your hip?

288
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:11,460
Did you hear? They're giving us
a half day today.

289
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,250
- We can leave at 2:00.
- Oh! Great!

290
00:14:14,746 --> 00:14:15,822
Thanks, Herm.

291
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:27,598
These costumes are ridiculous.

292
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:31,030
Plus, the Amazon Warrior Princess armor
gave me a rash.

293
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,584
Cards on the table... you weren't
the first lady to wear that in here.

294
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:36,915
But it conveyed power.
And so will this.

295
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:38,748
What I need you to do now

296
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:40,899
is break these 15 bricks
with your forehead.

297
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,827
What?! But you didn't do
a damn thing in your video.

298
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:47,015
You just stood near a horse
and sat on a motorcycle.

299
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,521
That's because I'm a man.
You're a woman.

300
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,793
The assumption is that
you can't do anything.

301
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:53,832
But you have to prove society wrong.

302
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,888
I can't break 15 bricks
with my forehead.

303
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:01,351
It's not 1950 anymore.
Yes, you can.

304
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:04,490
- I'm out of here.
- What? Why?

305
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,635
None of this is going to help me
get a job.

306
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:09,157
I'm about to get kicked
out of the country.

307
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:11,846
I know what I have to do.

308
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,720
Is this where the Lottery Girl
auditions are?

309
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,959
Right here.

310
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,327
<i>So kids, your Aunt Robin
had reached her low point.</i>

311
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,872
<i>She was auditioning
to be the Lottery Girl.</i>

312
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:33,135
- And tonight's Lotto numbers are...
- Hold it.

313
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:35,568
Say the line before
you press the button.

314
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,221
- It builds the suspense.
- It builds the suspense.

315
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,941
And tonight's Lotto numbers are

316
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,314
- seventeen...
- Stop her.

317
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,414
Hold it.

318
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,461
Why did she say it like that?

319
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,806
It's like she's not even happy
about the 17 coming up.

320
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:58,330
- She seems mean.
- Yeah, she seems super-mean.

321
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:01,650
Can you take another run
at "17" for us?

322
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:04,283
Seventeen.

323
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:07,693
I don't even understand
what she's doing.

324
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:10,131
Let me try something.

325
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:12,899
Try being a little more wry.

326
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:16,384
Wry? About the number 17?

327
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,634
Wry, with a little bit of a...

328
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,592
- Twinkle.
- twinkle.

329
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:22,841
Seventeen.

330
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,312
That was great!

331
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,329
I got you a light beer.

332
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:32,298
I know how you dancers are
always counting calories.

333
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:33,686
It's not funny, all right?

334
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:36,278
The doctor says if it gets any worse,
I might need surgery.

335
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:38,436
Vaginal rejuvenation surgery?

336
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:41,988
You know who didn't do a lot of
operating on vaginas in college?

337
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,658
- Dr. X.
- He did just fine!

338
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:45,857
You know what?

339
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:49,932
Both of you geniuses need to take
that weak-ass crap off your résumés.

340
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:54,423
I mean, you are not Dr. X anymore,
and you cannot dunk anymore.

341
00:16:54,824 --> 00:16:55,734
Let it go.

342
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,261
So Marshall and I are the only people
at this table with

343
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:00,420
"weak-ass crap" on their résumés?

344
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,116
What are you implying?

345
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:08,936
I don't know! Does the date July 4,
1995 mean anything to you?

346
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:10,814
You son of a bitch.

347
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:16,484
Time!

348
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:18,906
And the new champion,
with 29 hot dogs,

349
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,114
Lily "The Belly" Aldrin.

350
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,124
How is that relevant
to teaching kindergarten?

351
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:32,058
It teaches kids that...

352
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:35,517
I can eat a lot of hot dogs
very quickly.

353
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,447
But you can't do it anymore!

354
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:39,868
You can't dunk anymore, Ladyhips!

355
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:41,304
How dare you!

356
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:43,418
- These hips can...
- Guys, guys!

357
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,312
I didn't even get the Lotto Girl gig.

358
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,742
I have to move back to Canada.

359
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:53,097
I can't believe this.

360
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:57,925
I remember the night
before I moved down here.

361
00:17:58,095 --> 00:18:00,393
They threw a going-away party for me.

362
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:04,473
They gave me a camera so I could
take pictures and send them home.

363
00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:09,437
And everyone was so sure
I was gonna be such a big success.

364
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:13,871
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

365
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:18,085
What happened?

366
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:20,984
Robin has to move back to Canada.

367
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,672
Oh, my God. How awful.

368
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:26,598
I mean, for one thing it's gonna be
a really long commute.

369
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:27,947
What do you mean?

370
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:30,262
I finished your video résumé on my own.

371
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:32,655
Messengered it to every station
in the city.

372
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:35,725
A guy from Channel Eight called.
He loved you.

373
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,160
He wanted you to come in and audition.

374
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:42,039
I told him no. Robin Scherbatsky
doesn't audition.

375
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:44,037
He gives you the job or nothing.

376
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,506
So I got the job?!

377
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:47,619
He cursed me out and hung up.

378
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:52,810
But then Channel 12 called.
They also loved you.

379
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:56,688
They offered you a job hosting
their new morning talk show.

380
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:59,689
- Barney, that's amazing!
- I told them to shove it.

381
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:02,605
Which only made them want you more.

382
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,206
So, they jacked up their offer
by ten percent.

383
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:06,913
Congratulations, Miss Scherbatsky.

384
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,289
It looks like you're gonna have
to stay.

385
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:19,128
- You're not about to dance, are you?
- No, I'm good.

386
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:20,693
I'll do it later.

387
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,632
How did you pull this off?

388
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:27,220
I am the master of the possimpible.

389
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:29,013
You really are.

390
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:30,724
Thank you.

391
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,441
<i>So, thanks to your Uncle Barney,
we got to keep your Aunt Robin.</i>

392
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:49,384
<i>And the rest of us decided
it was time to let some things go.</i>

393
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,410
<i>Well, except for Lily.</i>

394
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,188
And... time!

395
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,855
What's the count?

396
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,094
Thirty-three!

397
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,819
Why is no one coming
on my happening's.
