1
00:00:01,544 --> 00:00:03,712
Great. So, I'll give you a call.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,130
I hope you do.

3
00:00:08,536 --> 00:00:11,110
- Look at this.
- I just got that girl's number.

4
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,220
Check it out. Holly.

5
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:14,572
Nice.

6
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:18,426
Girls whose names end
in L-Y are always dirty.

7
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,603
Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.

8
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:25,623
Yeah, I know it's true.

9
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:29,221
And don't even
get me started on girls

10
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:32,297
whose names should end in Y,
but instead end in I.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,880
Those girls are like
roller coasters.

12
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,286
You got to wait in a long line,
but once you get up there,

13
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:39,927
you just hold on for dear life
and hope you don't drop your keys.

14
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:43,559
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call her right now.

15
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:47,104
I'm gonna do that whole,
"Remember me? It's been so long".

16
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:50,607
See, it's funny
because I just saw her.

17
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:51,826
You can't call her.

18
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,445
You have to wait 3 days
to call a woman. That's the rule.

19
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,578
Barney, that rule
is completely played out.

20
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:58,474
Girls know exactly
what you're doing.

21
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:00,025
I got a new rule.

22
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,356
It's kind of crazy, but I call it,

23
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:04,496
you like her, you call her.

24
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:08,167
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
I don't speak "I never get laid".

25
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:11,669
Barney, the 3 days rule is insane.

26
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:13,922
I mean, who even came up with that?

27
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:16,050
Jesus.

28
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,011
Barney, don't do this.
Not with Jesus.

29
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:20,352
Seriously.

30
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:23,373
Jesus started
the whole wait 3 days thing.

31
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:26,435
He waited 3 days to come back to life.
It was perfect.

32
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:28,129
If he have only waited one day,

33
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,073
people wouldn't have
even heard that he died.

34
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:32,316
They'd be all, "Jesus, what up?"

35
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:36,445
And Jesus would probably be,
like, "What up? I died yesterday".

36
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:40,532
And then they'd be all,
"You look pretty alive to me, dude".

37
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,039
And then he would have to explain
how he was resurrected

38
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:44,485
and how it was a miracle.

39
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,556
And then, the dude would be, like,
"Okay, whatever you say, bro".

40
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:51,627
Ancient dialogue
sounds so stilted now.

41
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,837
And he's not going
to come back on a Saturday.

42
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,381
Everybody's busy doing chores.

43
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,461
Working the loom,
trimming their beards.

44
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:02,350
No. He waits the exact
right number of days...

45
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,084
Three.

46
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:06,975
OK, I promise, I'll wait three days.
Just please stop talking.

47
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:10,521
Plus, it's Sunday,
so everyone's in church already.

48
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,733
They're all in there,
"No, Jesus is dead".

49
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,645
Then, bam! He bursts through
the back door, runs up the aisle.

50
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,873
Everyone's totally psyched.
And, FYI,

51
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:23,448
that's when
he invented the high-five.

52
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:26,991
Three days, Ted.
We wait three days to call a woman

53
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:30,332
because that's how long Jesus
wants us to wait.

54
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:33,676
True story.

55
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:50,102
Okay, fine. I promise.

56
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,104
I won't call Holly for three days.

57
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,972
<i>But I never said anything
about texting.</i>

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,858
<i>I started things off with something
cute and charming.</i>

59
00:02:57,983 --> 00:03:01,678
<i>"I was thinking about you, so I thought
I'd send you a little texty text."</i>

60
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:06,565
<i>And the moment I hit "Send",
I realized it wasn't cute at all.</i>

61
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:10,116
<i>It was the lamest thing
anyone has ever said to anyone.</i>

62
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,000
<i>And the worst thing about texting
is that once you send it</i>

63
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,938
<i>you can never get it back.</i>

64
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:23,883
<i>And then... you wait.</i>

65
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,159
<i>And just when you've decided
never to text anyone again...</i>

66
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,602
<i>"I've been thinking about you, too,"</i>

67
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,534
<i>"and how weird is it that you texted me
while I was in the bath?"</i>

68
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,117
- What was that?
- What?

69
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:47,034
- You made a noise.
- That was my phone. I got a text.

70
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:49,703
Not that. You made
your naked lady noise.

71
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,169
- What?!
- Whenever you see a naked lady,

72
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:53,682
you make the noise.

73
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,462
- I don't do that.
- Really?

74
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,692
God, sorry, Lily.

75
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:09,536
<i>While the men are out hunting,</i>

76
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:11,914
<i>the women of New Guinea's
indigenous Korowai tribe</i>

77
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,894
<i>wash their clothes in the river.</i>

78
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,653
That's totally a boob.

79
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:28,825
Is that Holly who keeps texting you?
Didn't you promise to wait three days?

80
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:31,536
To call, yes.
Texting is totally different.

81
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:35,082
Okay, well, just try to keep
the naked lady noises to a minimum.

82
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,251
I don't make a naked lady noise.

83
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:39,979
Really?

84
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,960
<i>Holly and I stayed up texting
until 2:00 in the morning.</i>

85
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,807
<i>And we spent the whole next day
texting each other, too.</i>

86
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:55,899
<i>She seemed perfect.</i>

87
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:01,775
Holly just told me what she's wearing
right now. It is pretty hot.

88
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:04,736
Yeah, whatever it is, I can
guarantee you she's not wearing it.

89
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,488
She's lying to make you like her.

90
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:08,073
How do you know that?

91
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,879
Because no woman
in the history of the world is ever

92
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:15,588
"just sitting around reading
architecture magazines in my old"

93
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,165
"cheerleader uniform."

94
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:21,420
Okay, maybe she's lying
about the architecture magazines.

95
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,821
- No. This is bad.
- What?

96
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:33,515
She just sent me a text that was
clearly meant for someone else.

97
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:38,603
"Baby, I picked up some take-out
from Generro's. Be home soon."

98
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,864
Okay, yes, this sounds bad,
but let's think about this, okay?

99
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:46,737
It could be for a brother
or maybe her sick dad.

100
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:48,005
Scroll down.

101
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:52,914
"And then I want you to
do me on the couch."

102
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,997
Okay, maybe not a sick dad.

103
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,830
Or a very sick dad. Am I right?

104
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,216
Sorry.

105
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:05,795
Hey, guys.

106
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:09,104
God. What is this?

107
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:13,405
It's some take-out from Generro's.
I'm bringing it home for Lily.

108
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,431
That's weird.

109
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:17,225
Holly just texted Ted something
about take-out from Generro's.

110
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,220
Wait a second.

111
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,625
You sons of bitches.

112
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:25,171
What?

113
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:26,931
You're Holly.

114
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:35,077
So Ted hasn't been texting
Holly at all?

115
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,722
He's been texting you two?

116
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:39,772
Look, we knew he'd try to call her
before the three days,

117
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:43,647
so I swiped his phone, and I changed
her number to my work cell.

118
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,430
We were just gonna bust on him
for calling her too soon, but then he

119
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:49,133
started texting her.

120
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,511
"Texty text"?!

121
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,651
Poor, sweet Ted. We should

122
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:59,312
- we should tell him it's us.
- Yeah.

123
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:00,437
Or

124
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,939
we pretend we're Holly,
and we're in the bath.

125
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:06,543
Yeah, that's better.

126
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,740
That was fun.

127
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,618
- We should tell him that it's us.
- Yeah, we should.

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Or

129
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:20,675
we tell him
our favorite color is red,

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,250
and we think the cowboy look
is very sexy.

131
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:25,786
Yeah, that's better.

132
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:30,841
I'm wearing them right now,
and they do look sexy.

133
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,105
- He put on the boots!
- He totally put on the boots!

134
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:38,307
That was awesome!

135
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:42,020
But it's time to tell him
who he really put those boots on for.

136
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,820
Yeah. Or

137
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:46,356
we just took off our shirt.

138
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:48,918
Yeah, that's better.

139
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:53,930
You think maybe we're wearing
a black lace bra underneath?

140
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:57,326
I don't think we're wearing anything
underneath.

141
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:58,827
God, we're hot.

142
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:04,531
Now he's only wearing
the cowboy boots!

143
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:06,506
- It is on!
- It is so on!

144
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:10,338
Tell him that we're...
we're slowing slipping out of our...

145
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:13,675
What are we doing?

146
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:17,751
I think that we're

147
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:19,861
about to have sex with Ted.

148
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:26,609
So, you did this to him all day?

149
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:27,856
That's just mean.

150
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:31,579
No, it was...
it was actually for his own good.

151
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:34,679
We're protecting him from himself.
He... really likes this girl.

152
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:36,156
He had that look in his eye.

153
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:39,861
Yeah, that crazy "I'm about to move
too fast and screw this up" look.

154
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,704
The same look he had
on his first date with you.

155
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,915
We all remember how that went.

156
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,010
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?

157
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,635
Yeah, well,
I think I was a special case.

158
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,466
This Holly is no Robin Scherbatsky.

159
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,182
What is the deal with her hair?

160
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:58,475
I mean, news flash:

161
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,104
They make conditioners
that don't leave a buildup.

162
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,521
I'm so bad.

163
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:06,074
Look, it's been a while
since Ted really liked someone.

164
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:08,565
He's clearly got a lot of crazy
stored up. We just

165
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,492
we thought we'd get him
to say "I love you"

166
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,478
before he makes contact
with this girl.

167
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:15,529
And you can tell it's on the way.
He's exhibiting all the telltale signs.

168
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:18,282
Yeah. One:
He joked about getting married.

169
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:21,448
<i>"You like architecture?
We should get married."</i>

170
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:25,527
<i>"Ha-ha. LOL. Just kidding.
Question mark?"</i>

171
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,918
Two: He made a crazy way
too soon trip suggestion.

172
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,713
<i>"I like beer, too.</i>

173
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,999
<i>"We should totally go
to Germany together."</i>

174
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:36,857
<i>"LOL. JK. LOL."</i>

175
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:41,930
And three:
He got way too personal way too soon.

176
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,257
<i>"Yeah, my parents got divorced
a couple years back.</i>

177
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:46,932
<i>"It was really tough."</i>

178
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,467
"<i>LOL."</i>

179
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,982
And he clearly doesn't know
what LOL means.

180
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,958
Yeah, but here's the real problem.
Ted wasn't saying "I love you"

181
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,820
as easily as we thought he would.

182
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,855
Then we met... Stan.

183
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,312
Why are you making
so much noise, man?

184
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:12,540
So we explained everything to him,
and when we were done,

185
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,671
something amazing happened.

186
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:17,633
Why don't you tell Ted
that just knowing he's out there,

187
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,857
thinking about you,
caring about you,

188
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:21,303
makes you feel safe?

189
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:25,026
So, all your fears,
all your yesterdays wash away,

190
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:28,769
and only hope remains
in the promise of his embrace.

191
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:32,999
Go, Stan.

192
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,734
- Who is this guy?
- A security guard who works nights.

193
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,487
- He eats lunch at MacLaren's every day.
- And he wasn't done.

194
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:39,863
Not by a long shot.

195
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:43,113
You make me thank God
for every mistake I ever made

196
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:46,536
because each one led me down
the path that brought me to you.

197
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,873
That's... really nice, man.

198
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,792
Whatever. It's okay.

199
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,428
<i>"And when we finally come together,</i>

200
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:57,203
<i>"I want you to hold me."</i>

201
00:10:57,517 --> 00:10:59,241
Hold me all night.

202
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,742
Stroke my hair.

203
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,869
Tell me I'm a woman
and show me you're a man.

204
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:05,992
Until there there was only now.

205
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:07,931
You and I,

206
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:10,044
and now.

207
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,471
You want me to text that to Ted.

208
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:17,034
I know that.

209
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:21,372
<i>"I do not ask
of the night explanations.</i>

210
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:24,148
<i>"I wait for it, and it envelops me,</i>

211
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:26,809
<i>"and so you and bread"</i>

212
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:30,057
<i>"and light and shadow are."</i>

213
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,623
That's Pablo Neruda.

214
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:34,383
I don't know

215
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,626
what bread was doing in there,
but that touched me here

216
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:41,341
and here.

217
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,341
Well, if Ted won't say it, I will.

218
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,740
I love you.

219
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:50,392
That's cool.

220
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:53,895
Still nothing, huh?

221
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,564
Maybe he's not in love with us.

222
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:58,453
How can he not be in love with us?
We're everything he's looking for.

223
00:11:58,569 --> 00:11:59,840
I don't get men.

224
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:02,695
Got to head to work.

225
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,854
Will you be... Will you be back?

226
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:09,078
I'll be back when the wind
and fates and chance bring me back.

227
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,160
Which will be tomorrow.

228
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:12,789
It's cheese steak day.

229
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:18,503
It sounds like
you were all over this guy.

230
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:21,199
Hope his girlfriend
didn't get jealous.

231
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,383
Did he mention a girlfriend or...?

232
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:26,017
It was all going great

233
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,639
until Marshall sent Ted
a text meant for Lily

234
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:30,849
- and ruined everything.
- It doesn't matter.

235
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,326
Okay? It's over now.

236
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,543
I got to get going,
but here's what's gonna happen:

237
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,515
You're going to call him right now,

238
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,951
tell him what you did,
and apologize.

239
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,076
You got it?

240
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:45,454
Or...

241
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,331
Holly explained everything.
It was all just a misunderstanding.

242
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:50,619
Everything's great now.

243
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:51,788
Really?

244
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:54,498
How did Holly explain
her way out of that one?

245
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,666
Apparently,

246
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,423
her dumb friend Marsha
accidentally used her phone

247
00:12:58,548 --> 00:13:01,341
- to text her husband Billy.
- Marsha and Billy.

248
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,339
No one sprained any muscles there.

249
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:06,762
And now we are better than ever.

250
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:09,010
Look, I know this sounds crazy,

251
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:11,712
but I think I might actually
be falling for this girl.

252
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,476
You're falling
for Barney and Marshall.

253
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:16,898
- What?
- They didn't believe

254
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:18,462
that you could wait the 3 days,

255
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:21,876
so Barney changed her number
in your phone to his work cell.

256
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,985
Holly is Barney and Marshall.

257
00:13:24,214 --> 00:13:26,320
Wait. That whole time it was them?

258
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:29,282
So Holly wasn't in the bath?

259
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:36,122
Or sitting by her window, looking up
at the stars, thinking about me?

260
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:42,535
Or lounging
in her old cheerleader uniform

261
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,172
reading architecture magazines?

262
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:50,468
Yeah. I don't think
they actually did those things.

263
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:51,847
They were just at the bar.

264
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:53,657
Right.

265
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:54,891
But, it was them.

266
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:58,270
- Unbelievable.
- I know.

267
00:13:58,657 --> 00:14:00,605
So you might as well tell them
you're on to them.

268
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:03,472
Or...

269
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:07,152
I text them something
that will really mess with their heads.

270
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:08,864
Oh, I gotcha.

271
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:11,328
How about...

272
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:14,160
"I haven't told any
of my friends yet,

273
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:16,580
but I only have three months
to live"?

274
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:17,748
Not bad.

275
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,540
How about "I once killed a man
with a shovel,

276
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,502
and those feelings
are creeping up again"?

277
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:25,876
I liked that thing
someone said before

278
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:27,571
about having three months to live.

279
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,945
How about "I never told anyone this,

280
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,220
but I slept
with my best friend's mom"?

281
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:35,104
That is good, but I feel
like we keep coming back

282
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:36,891
to that three months to live thing.

283
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:38,977
Wait. I think I got it.

284
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:43,899
He texted back!

285
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:47,294
"I probably shouldn't tell you this.

286
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:50,597
"I mean we barely know each other."

287
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,949
"But what the hell,
I'll just say it."

288
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,334
This is it, dude.
Here comes the "I love you."

289
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:57,954
- I wish Stan were here.
- Stan.

290
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:02,876
What?

291
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:07,159
"I sometimes have gay dreams
about my best friend."

292
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:17,335
"I sometimes have gay dreams
about my best friend."

293
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:21,168
Why in the world would Ted text
a girl he barely knows

294
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:23,508
that he sometimes has gay dreams
about me?

295
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:25,760
Slow your roll.

296
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:26,885
You?

297
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,555
He's clearly talking about me.

298
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:31,183
Dude, it's me.
I'm his best friend.

299
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:33,052
Okay, one:
That has never been proven.

300
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,202
Two:
If anyone were to have gay dreams

301
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:37,226
about one of us, it would be me.

302
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,609
I mean, look at me.
Now look at you.

303
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:44,779
A still-in-the-closet 80-year-old
wouldn't be into that mess.

304
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,617
Here's the thing, Barney.
I'm snuggly. You're not.

305
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,850
Who wouldn't want to snuggle up next

306
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:52,850
to this business
on a Sunday morning?

307
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:55,391
Wrapped in a comforter,
and it's raining outside,

308
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:58,441
and there's muffins warming in the oven.
I'm cuddly, bitch.

309
00:15:58,566 --> 00:15:59,932
Deal with it.

310
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:01,922
I work out every day.

311
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:04,393
If there is one thing
we know about Ted,

312
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:07,427
it's that he likes a nice body.
This body would rock his world.

313
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:10,394
Ted and I have a history.
I know what he likes.

314
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,682
There are things I could do to him
that would blow his mind...

315
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:19,731
- Why do we want to have sex with Ted?
- I don't know. It's weird.

316
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,210
Crazy, right?

317
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:24,754
Ted's having gay dreams about me.

318
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:29,006
And by me, he means M-E,
Marshall Eriksen,

319
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:31,576
star of Ted's gay dreams.

320
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:32,567
Who cares?

321
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,150
So Ted has gay dreams
about one of you guys.

322
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:38,239
It's not like you found out
he has three months to live.

323
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:41,729
That's like... shocking, right?

324
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,046
Look at this guy.

325
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:46,674
How's it going best friend
of 12 years?

326
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,542
Well, it's kind of weird, but...

327
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:54,474
I had this crazy dream the other night.
It's a little embarrassing.

328
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:57,394
You can tell us, Ted.
This is a safe space.

329
00:16:57,563 --> 00:17:00,039
Yeah, your feelings are
perfectly natural, buddy.

330
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:02,737
Here's what happened.

331
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,278
<i>And then I proceed
to waste a half hour</i>

332
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:08,613
<i>of those bastards' lives,
telling them about this dream</i>

333
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:12,325
<i>I had where I ate dinner with my top 5
favorite architects throughout history.</i>

334
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:14,909
And then, at the end of the meal,

335
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,221
Frank Gehry slides the check
over to I.M. Pei, and he says,

336
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:22,160
"Buddy, tonight,
your name is I.M. Paying."

337
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:26,498
Buckminster Fuller
almost did a spit take.

338
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:29,593
And then I woke up.

339
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:32,554
So, that's it?

340
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:34,993
No other dreams?

341
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:38,393
Nothing confusing or erotic?

342
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:44,063
Okay, how about this? You know
how at some point in the future,

343
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,541
- machines will rise up against us?
- Sure.

344
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,070
So, the machines...
they've killed everybody,

345
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:50,981
and all that's left

346
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,156
is you,

347
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,331
me,

348
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:56,345
and Barney.

349
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:59,430
Which one of us would you, like

350
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:02,707
get with?

351
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:06,183
And

352
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,548
why do I have
to get with one of you?

353
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,547
The machines are forcing you.

354
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,094
They want to watch.
That's just how they get down.

355
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,964
That's a tough one.
I guess it would have to be...

356
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,050
Holly.

357
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:25,740
Robin told me what you guys did.

358
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:29,189
That's why I made up the gay
dreams thing. Guys, this is Holly.

359
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,866
And I didn't wait your precious
three days to call her.

360
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:34,908
I knew where she worked,
so I tracked her down.

361
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,553
Let me ask you.
Did I call you too soon?

362
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:39,993
I loved that he called me
right away.

363
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,414
I found it very romantic.

364
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:44,045
And I don't sit around my apartment

365
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,752
reading architecture magazines
in my old cheerleader uniform.

366
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,142
I do that completely naked.

367
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,982
So Holly and I
are going out to dinner.

368
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:58,431
I'll meet you out front.

369
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:03,603
I'm sorry, buddy.
We were just trying to help you.

370
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:06,532
And, also, it was really fun.

371
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,569
I don't need your help, okay?
I can take care of myself.

372
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,829
And, yeah, maybe...
maybe there are some girls

373
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,916
who wouldn't like it
that I called them right away

374
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,256
or said things too soon,
but guess what?

375
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,204
Those aren't the right girls for me.

376
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:23,632
Maybe the right girl is the one

377
00:19:23,757 --> 00:19:26,044
who loves that I do those things
because

378
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,565
that's just who I am,
and I'm not gonna change

379
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,672
because of some stupid
Three Days Rule.

380
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:36,856
Holly spells her name with an "I".

381
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:41,442
<i>So I had proven
that the Three Days Rule was wrong,</i>

382
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,693
<i>and I was out to dinner
with a pretty girl.</i>

383
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:45,729
<i>And until right now,
I've never told anyone</i>

384
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:48,008
<i>the truth about what happened
on that date.</i>

385
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,757
That's so funny!
I love indie music, too.

386
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:52,527
We should get married.

387
00:19:53,197 --> 00:19:54,614
Just kidding.

388
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:55,989
Or am I?

389
00:19:56,982 --> 00:19:58,033
Just kidding again.

390
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,577
That's it. We're totally going
to Brazil together!

391
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:03,638
And I went to my doctor this morning,
and he said it is all cleared up,

392
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:04,873
so I'm good to go.

393
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:06,833
I think I'm in love with you.

394
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:09,925
<i>In the end, I didn't need
to wait three days,</i>

395
00:20:10,254 --> 00:20:12,253
<i>but Holly really, really did.</i>

396
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:15,214
<i>Like a lot of rules,
there are times to follow them</i>

397
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,590
<i>and times to not.</i>

398
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,178
<i>But I will tell you this.</i>

399
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:20,764
<i>When I got your mother's number,</i>

400
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,589
<i>I called her right away.</i>

401
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:29,351
Hey, fellas.

402
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:31,689
- Aren't you working?
- Took the night off.

403
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:35,283
- That's great! We can all hang out!
- Yeah. I can't. Got a date.

404
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:37,389
You ready, baby?

405
00:20:37,962 --> 00:20:39,062
What the...?

406
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:42,958
Wait, wait. Couldn't you guys
just stay here and do your date with us?

407
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:44,960
Yeah, it'll be fun!

408
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:48,175
Look, I'm laughing!
It's fun here! You like magic?

409
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:51,675
Fellas, it's time we said good-bye.

410
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:54,166
I mean, we shared a very special
afternoon together,

411
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,346
and that's something
I will always cherish.

412
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,572
I'll never forget you guys.

413
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:02,049
- Do you know their names?
- No idea. Is the tall one Ted?

414
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,136
No. That's Marshall.
He's married to Lily.

415
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:06,163
Okay. You like chicken wings?
