1
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:04,642
It's freezing out there.
Where's your coat?

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,117
I'm Canadian.
I don't need a coat.

3
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:08,941
This kind of weather
is nothing for me.

4
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:11,005
This is like a spring day back
in Minnesota,

5
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:14,535
if it weren't for all the taxis and
the skyscrapers and non-white people.

6
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:16,316
There aren't any black people
in Minnesota?

7
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,025
Not if Prince is on tour.

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,132
Well, my sister's plane got
in an hour ago,

9
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:36,003
or as a meteorologist might say,

10
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,489
Hurricane Heather has
just made landfall.

11
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,460
Come on. She's not that bad.

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,570
Here's the back
of Heather's baseball card.

13
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:45,222
It took her six years to graduate
from three different colleges,

14
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:48,966
during which time she wrecked
two cars, got married for five days,

15
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,393
and lived in a tree for nine weeks,
only to realize

16
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:54,183
that no one had any intention
of cutting it down.

17
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:57,179
And now, Heather says
she's moving to New York.

18
00:00:57,464 --> 00:00:58,621
That's big news.

19
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:00,312
She's never gonna
go through with it.

20
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:02,963
Remember a few years back when
she talked about transferring to NYU?

21
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:05,619
And then, on the day
of the admissions interview...

22
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,304
Where's my couch and my TV?

23
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,051
I sold them for
Nine Inch Nails tickets.

24
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,619
The TV alone is worth two grand.

25
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:20,204
Well, a last-minute plane ticket
is expensive.

26
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:23,816
- Wait. Where are you?
- Somewhere in Spain.

27
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,193
Gotta go. Slow song.

28
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,303
Oh, crap.

29
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,080
- It's Barney.
- So?

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,663
For all the years
Heather's been visiting New York,

31
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,442
Ted's never let Barney meet her.

32
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:39,765
And I never will.

33
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:43,393
Every year when the Mosby family
Christmas card shows up...

34
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:48,737
Pulling down her pants
Yanking off my own.

35
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:52,271
Underneath the mistletoe
I'll make your sister moan.

36
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:56,179
Oh! Heather's hot, Heather's hot
We'll go all the way...

37
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:58,425
I wish I could see her naked

38
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:00,635
I wish I could see her naked

39
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:02,864
I wish I could see her naked.

40
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:05,340
And down on all fours.

41
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:09,544
Ted has a little sister
Gets hotter every day.

42
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,521
And if I ever meet her
With her boobies I will play!

43
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:14,903
Everybody!
Sister, sister, sister!

44
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:18,119
What? I can celebrate
Hanukkah, too.

45
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,830
It's him again.

46
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,503
I should probably get it.

47
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,198
<i>Hey. What's on tap for tonight?</i>

48
00:02:25,298 --> 00:02:27,120
We're heading over
to Marshall and Lily's

49
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,420
for a Kathy Bates movie marathon,
but not Misery.

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,752
You wanna join us?

51
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,102
He hung up.

52
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:42,444
- It's great to see you.
- Hey, kiddo. You look great.

53
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:43,762
How are things back home?

54
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:45,955
Well, I moved into your old room.

55
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,752
Did you know that
you can see strange.

56
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:50,259
Mrs. Gottwald's bedroom
across the street?

57
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:53,046
I am aware of that.
How's she looking?

58
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:55,611
- Ted, she's 62.
- Answer the question.

59
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:57,642
Surprisingly perky.

60
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:01,428
Man, it is cold out there.

61
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,520
Why, hello.

62
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:08,033
I've been waiting for you.

63
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:10,769
Wait a second.
That's not our chair.

64
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,982
Did you bring that chair yourself?

65
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,846
I need one that swivels.

66
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:33,532
How did you even know
Heather was coming into town?

67
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,890
Never tell me anything!

68
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,665
You know I can't keep secrets
around Christmas!

69
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:40,866
Robin's giving you an iPod!

70
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:44,867
Can I chat with you
for a sec in the kitchen?

71
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,844
No one touch the chair.
It's a rental.

72
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,210
I can't believe you've been hiding
your sister from me all these years.

73
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,412
Do you blame me?

74
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:54,904
You're like Weird Al Yankovic

75
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:57,768
if he only wrote Christmas songs
about banging my sister.

76
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:02,219
Okay. First of all,
I'm flattered.

77
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,844
Secondly, they're just jokes.

78
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:07,132
A bro can joke
about another bro's sister.

79
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,326
It doesn't mean
I'm ever gonna act on it.

80
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,658
I love my sister,
and as her older brother,

81
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:14,554
it's my job to protect her
from guys like you.

82
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:16,507
You don't trust me, do you?

83
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:19,573
- And I don't trust her either.
- Fine. Great.

84
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,771
I guess I'll just

85
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:23,491
take my chair and go.

86
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,239
Wait... Stop... Come back...

87
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,846
Lily and I are taking Heather out
for dinner on Sunday.

88
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:35,966
Do you wanna come?

89
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,909
I already called Hurley's
and added a fourth.

90
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,761
- You really can't tell Lily anything.
- No, you can't tell her...

91
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:44,382
<i>That year, the holidays were really
making Aunt Robin miss Canada,</i>

92
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:46,100
<i>so Marshall brought her
to the spot</i>

93
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,331
<i>he went whenever he got homesick
for Minnesota:</i>

94
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,795
<i>The Walleye Saloon.</i>

95
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,300
Evening, everybody.

96
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:53,871
Meet Robin.

97
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,341
Go back to drinking.

98
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,897
- What's up, Marshall?
- Hey, what's u...? Whoa! Bud!

99
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,699
What's with the hitch
in your giddyap?

100
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,237
I was playing some hockey today.

101
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,345
Tore up something in my knee.

102
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,642
Did you go to the hospital?

103
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:07,697
I just poured some beer on it.

104
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,937
Can't miss the Vikes game.
Twin Cities!

105
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,927
I love the guys here.
They're real men.

106
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,080
No hair products or manicures.

107
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,637
All New York guys are like 10% girl.

108
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,707
Come on.
That seems a little unfair.

109
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:27,503
I'll have the vichyssoise with just
a soupçon of crème fraîche.

110
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:29,356
Too much dairy
and I tend to bloat.

111
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:33,894
I found an apartment today.

112
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:35,232
Really?

113
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:37,129
And I was hoping you'd have

114
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,776
a little more wine in you before
I asked you this, but...

115
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,328
I need you to co-sign the lease.

116
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:47,438
Let me think about it.

117
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:50,428
That means he's not
going to do it.

118
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:53,098
I could really use your help on this.

119
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:55,256
Let's talk about this later, okay?

120
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,288
Don't hold your breath.

121
00:05:57,776 --> 00:05:58,778
What is it?

122
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:00,898
You don't trust me?

123
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:02,361
You're my sister.

124
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:04,713
Now he's just stating a fact.

125
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,702
Look, Ted,

126
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:09,379
I am serious about a career
in finance, but..

127
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,535
You just keep looking at me like I'm

128
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,028
a four-year-old who says
she wants to be an astronaut.

129
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:15,726
I just don't think
you have any idea

130
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,478
how tough it is to make
it in New York.

131
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,975
Exactly. You need connections.

132
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:23,457
If only Ted knew someone
who worked at, say...

133
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:26,448
Goliath National Bank,
then... wait.

134
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:28,065
What?

135
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,938
I work at Goliath National Bank.
How 'bout that?

136
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:35,872
All right.

137
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,546
We got two Bemidji Pale Ales and

138
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:40,498
who ordered the mini-burgers?

139
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,002
Oh, my God!
Is that Fisherman's Quest?

140
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,641
I used to play FQ
all the time back home!

141
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:51,239
I kinda have high score.

142
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,645
Not to brag, but I caught

143
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,334
a 35-inch northern pike.

144
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:59,511
The biggest video fish
anyone's ever reeled in.

145
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:01,547
I mean... freshwater.

146
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,371
A tip of the angler's cap, my friend.

147
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:08,151
Thank you for bringing me here.

148
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,729
Those are mine.

149
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:14,092
This is not a good idea.

150
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:16,875
Heather and Barney alone in his office?

151
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:19,283
And I certainly don't want to be
on the hook for her lease.

152
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:22,181
She is growing up.
You just can't see it yet.

153
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,881
We're talking about a girl
who was busted for shoplifting

154
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:26,228
eight months ago.

155
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:29,914
Ted, a lot of women
go through a shoplifting phase.

156
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,346
And sure, maybe to this day,

157
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:34,453
they swipe the occasional
smaller item

158
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:38,207
because it turns them on in a weird way
that they can't quite explain.

159
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,547
But

160
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:43,618
if it'll make you feel better,
I'll tag along to GNB tomorrow.

161
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:45,458
I'll say I'm having lunch
with Marshall,

162
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:48,571
but actually,
I'll be spying on her and Barney.

163
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:51,777
I'm good with that.

164
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:56,905
Good luck tomorrow at GNB.
I'm sure you'll knock 'em dead.

165
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:58,878
And I'll be spying on you guys.

166
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:00,387
Damn it!

167
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:07,541
"I'm drinking till I forget the
1999 NFC Championship"?

168
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,007
That game.

169
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:12,013
The Vikings were two minutes away
from going to the Super Bowl,

170
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:15,309
when our kicker, who hadn't missed
all year, shanked a field goal,

171
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,531
and we lost in overtime. Damn!

172
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:20,267
'99 NFC Championship game?

173
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:21,617
Damn!

174
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:26,734
My dad, who I'd never seen cry my
whole life, wiped away a tear.

175
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,574
He said...

176
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:31,408
"A little part of me just died, son."

177
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:36,234
I love how intense you guys are
about your Vikings.

178
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:39,128
It's like when we watch
hockey night in Canada...

179
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,062
What?

180
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:46,806
Don't let anyone in here know
that you're not from Minnesota.

181
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,588
Why? What are they gonna do
if they find out I'm from...

182
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:52,201
Does this look like a Dallas bar
to you, pal?

183
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:55,812
It's weird, but there's something
comforting about being carried like this.

184
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:02,749
Man, can you believe that guy?

185
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:05,620
So, Robin, where are you from?

186
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,690
Bemidji.

187
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:15,530
Bemidji, Minnesota. Go, Vikes!

188
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:21,460
<i>Kids, for what happened next,
I'm gonna jump ahead a couple days.</i>

189
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,716
That is a pretty sweet briefcase.

190
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:27,574
That's a pretty sweet
security camera, too.

191
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:29,787
And there's another one.
And a guard.

192
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:32,088
I'm planning on paying for it, Ted.

193
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:33,920
Well, you don't have the job yet.

194
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:36,805
That door's a push, not a pull.

195
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:38,535
There you go.

196
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:41,365
Thanks again for keeping an eye
on her yesterday.

197
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,696
Look, maybe I was wrong.

198
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:44,620
She sounds like
she handled Barney just fine.

199
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,395
Maybe she'll be able
to handle New York.

200
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,170
No thanks necessary!

201
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:49,920
Why not?

202
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,527
I have a secret. No, I don't!

203
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:53,743
Nothing happened.
Something happened.

204
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,337
What happened?

205
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,430
Nothing.
After Heather's interview,

206
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,726
I went to say hi to Marshall
for a few minutes,

207
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:01,688
and when I came back...

208
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:04,361
Oh, my God!

209
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:08,530
Before you say or do anything,
I beg you one favor.

210
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:09,394
What?

211
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:11,326
Get off that. It's Prada.

212
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:15,386
- I am so sorry.
- I knew it.

213
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,317
I knew it all along.
She is still the same,

214
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,347
irresponsible train wreck
that she always was,

215
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:21,971
- and when I see Barney...
- You won't say a word.

216
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:24,350
Heather begged me not to tell you.

217
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,192
She will hate my guts
if she knows that I blabbed.

218
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:31,046
I love that briefcase,
but I can't afford it.

219
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:32,767
You were right, Ted.

220
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,215
- I certainly was.
- See?

221
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,563
She didn't get the briefcase!
That's responsible!

222
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:43,220
And there's almost no way she
had sex with anyone in there.

223
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:45,269
Turning over a new leaf.

224
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:52,000
Evening, everybody!

225
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,896
So my dad and I are at the
'99 NFC Championship game.

226
00:10:56,395 --> 00:10:58,053
I say evening, everybody!

227
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:00,800
And when we missed that
field goal and lost...

228
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:02,954
- Damn!
- Damn

229
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:08,698
my dad, who I had never seen cry
in my entire life,

230
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:11,921
wiped away a tear and said,

231
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:15,471
"A little part of me just died, son."

232
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,870
"Son"?

233
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,717
I told it the way
I'm gonna tell my son.

234
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:25,030
If I'm ever lucky enough
to have a son,

235
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:26,993
and name him

236
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,160
Rashad Tarkenton.

237
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:34,529
- Great story.
- Great story!

238
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,808
But it does sound
a little bit familiar.

239
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:38,772
I know!

240
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,416
They totally ate it up.

241
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:42,537
- I see what you're doing here.
- What?

242
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,995
I brought you here as a favor
because

243
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,457
because I felt sorry for you, okay?

244
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:49,907
And now it's like you're trying
to steal my bar.

245
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,674
You think I'm trying
to steal your bar?

246
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:55,123
- Get oot.
- "Get oot"?

247
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,646
- What, are you Canadian?
- No, I...

248
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:59,383
If you want to impersonate a Canadian,

249
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,385
just turn of the lights
and get all scared!

250
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:07,669
What was that?

251
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:09,526
Well, with Canada right across
the border,

252
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,841
we Minnesotans sometimes like
to make jokes

253
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,810
at your guys' expense and they're all
sort of along the same theme.

254
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,893
That we're afraid of the dark?

255
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:18,515
For example:

256
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:22,712
Hey, everyone, how many Canadians
does it take to change a lightbulb?

257
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:26,441
"What? Oh, no, the lightbulb's out?!
I'm scared!"

258
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,481
That is insane.

259
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:31,789
Why do you think the Canadians
are afraid of the dark?

260
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,681
Where does any prejudice
come from, Robin?

261
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:36,839
A stereotype starts, and all of a sudden
it spreads like wildfire. Like.

262
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,319
Asians can't drive,
Scotsmen are cheap,

263
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,677
Brazilians always put on way
too much postage.

264
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:44,173
I just don't think this is gonna
work out, Robin.

265
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:45,950
You can't be hanging out
with people who

266
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,007
belittle your beloved homeland, so

267
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:49,404
I'll walk you out.

268
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:52,028
Wait, I have something to say.

269
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,061
Hey, everybody.

270
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:58,830
Let me tell you something
about people from Canada.

271
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,181
Please don't make a scene.

272
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:04,650
Do you know why Canadians
never get a birthday wish?

273
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:07,729
Because they're too afraid
to blow out the candles.

274
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,682
Oh, God, I love it here. God.

275
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:17,073
I think your prospects
at GNB are good.

276
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,776
You certainly made it clear
you're will to take any position.

277
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:21,519
Are these new coasters?

278
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,453
Well, I hope you get the job.

279
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:26,754
Nothing gives me more pleasure than
filling an opening.

280
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:29,126
I swear to God
these coasters are thicker.

281
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,603
Well, I am willing to bend
over backwards.

282
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:35,178
That's it! I cannot believe
you had sex with my sister!

283
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:38,517
- You blabbed?!
- Do you know what?

284
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,780
This is a new batch
of the old coasters.

285
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,826
I'm just gonna confirm that
with the bartender.

286
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:46,119
And you, you're mature
and responsible now?

287
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,796
Is it mature and responsible

288
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:50,016
to go to your first big job
interview in New York City

289
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:51,843
and nail a total stranger?

290
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:53,795
You've always been
immature and irresponsible.

291
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:56,041
You will always be
immature and irresponsible.

292
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:59,491
And I wouldn't cosign a library card
for you, let alone a lease.

293
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:02,383
- Barney and I didn't have sex.
- Save it. Lily saw you.

294
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:03,854
Or did she?

295
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,914
<i>You see, Ted, you had so little faith
in Heather and me...</i>

296
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:10,893
<i>We decided to give you
exactly what you expected of us.</i>

297
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,109
<i>And I knew we could
count on Lily to blab.</i>

298
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,838
Oh, my God!

299
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,498
What? Why would you do that?

300
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,169
Because you deserved it.

301
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:20,291
You know I'm no saint.

302
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:24,402
And yes, it's true that time I drove
your mother to the airport,

303
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:26,814
well, let's just say there was a

304
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:31,175
very confusing, sexually charged
moment in short-term parking,

305
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:34,859
but I said I would never
go near your sister,

306
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:36,101
and I meant it.

307
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:37,557
You should have trusted me.

308
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:41,198
You're so convinced I'm still
some out-of-control teenager,

309
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,692
you missed the fact I grew up.

310
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:45,594
I'm gonna find a hotel.

311
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:47,396
I'll get my things later.

312
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,304
Merry Christmas.

313
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:56,443
Your mom and I kissed.

314
00:14:58,511 --> 00:14:59,670
Better get a move on.

315
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,096
You got five seconds
to catch two more sturgeon.

316
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:04,347
We got a possible gill screen.

317
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,209
Forget it. You can't catch two fish
with one hook.

318
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,655
But I can catch one fish

319
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,253
and use that fish
to catch the other one.

320
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:19,442
High score! You beat Marshall!

321
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,137
She's Canadian!

322
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:24,903
Robin's Canadian!

323
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:27,504
She's Canadian.

324
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,593
She's not from Bemidji and she doesn't
know a darn thing about the Vikings.

325
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:34,160
You're just mad
'cause she got high score.

326
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:39,786
In the '99 NFC Championship game
when the Vikings lost...

327
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,882
- Damn!
- Oh, damn!

328
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,750
Who was the kicker
who missed the field goal?

329
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:04,139
He's now retired.
Owns a fly-fishing business

330
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,607
in Canada.

331
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:08,955
Good-bye, Robin.

332
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,477
You know what?

333
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,709
I'm glad you found oot

334
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:26,710
because I'm proud to be Canadian.

335
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,537
We may not have
a fancy NFL team or Prince,

336
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:34,325
but we invented Trivial Pursuit.

337
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:36,057
You're welcome, Earth!

338
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:40,179
Plus in Canada,
you can go to an all-nude strip club

339
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,099
and order alcohol.

340
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:43,526
That's right.

341
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:48,111
From Moosejaw to the Bay of Fundy,
you can suck down a 20-ounce pilsner

342
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:52,079
while watching some coal miner's daughter
strip down to her pelt.

343
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:53,268
Jealous?!

344
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:57,535
In Canada people don't care
where you're from,

345
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,960
as long as you're friendly and
maybe loan them a smoke or

346
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,544
hand over a donut.

347
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:05,890
I'm proud to be
from the Great White North,

348
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:08,837
and I wish
I was there right now.

349
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:14,147
And we're not afraid of the dark.

350
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,569
I mean, we don't love it,
but who does?

351
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:32,141
Merry Christmas.

352
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:35,724
Look inside.

353
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:39,877
You just,

354
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:42,225
if you push it towards the...
not down, towards the middle.

355
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,861
- Don't need your help.
- Got it.

356
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,887
You signed the lease.

357
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:56,245
You know why?

358
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,991
Because you trust me
and think it's a great idea?

359
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,559
Because I want
to get to know you.

360
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:03,883
The new you.

361
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,412
By the way,
in your new neighborhood,

362
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:15,592
you really should get a
good solid deadbolt for the door.

363
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:17,296
If you want

364
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,262
to live.

365
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm so sorry for what happened
back there.

366
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,773
I acted like a total jerk.

367
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,648
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, look, I'msorry.

368
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,156
That was your place.
I shouldn't have tried to make it mine.

369
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,498
Just every year at the holidays,
I get homesick.

370
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,563
And so far, every year
I've had a reason to stay,

371
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,473
a boyfriend, a job,

372
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,116
or something.

373
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:55,258
But this year for the first time,
I don't.

374
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:57,125
Yes, you do.

375
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:58,778
What?

376
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,642
We all love you, okay?

377
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:05,757
If you ever moved back to Canada,
we would hop on a plane,

378
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,850
we would track you down, and

379
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,671
after Barney dragged us to a few
of those strip clubs you talked about,

380
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:15,843
we would bring you back right here
where you're supposed to be. It's

381
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,144
it's not New York
without Robin Scherbatsky.

382
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,357
I just miss it there sometimes.

383
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:30,236
I wish I could blink my eyes and be back
in Canada for an hour, you know?

384
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,681
I was hoping you would say that.

385
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:39,787
<i>Once, there was this girl who.</i>

386
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:42,916
<i>Wouldn't go and change
With the girls</i>

387
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:45,442
<i>- in the change room...
- How did you find this place?</i>

388
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:48,602
- Feels like home, right?
- There's one way to find out.

389
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:53,205
Well, sorry there. Didn't see ya.
Are you okay?

390
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:56,382
- I'm fine.
- Okay, sorry aboot that.

391
00:19:57,272 --> 00:19:58,920
Have a donut on the hoose.

392
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:04,776
You bumped into him,
and he apologized

393
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:06,760
and gave you a donut on the hoose?

394
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,559
It's just like home.

395
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:13,802
It's gonna be fine!

396
00:20:16,421 --> 00:20:18,399
No one likes the dark.

397
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,939
Next up from Ontario,

398
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:29,038
Marshall Erickson.

399
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:31,283
I didn't know you signed up.
What are you gonna sing?

400
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:32,837
I think you'll recognize it.

401
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:36,608
<i>But that's okay,
I'm gonna rock your body anyway</i>

402
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:38,774
<i>I'm gonna rock your body
till Canada Day!</i>

403
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:41,056
Buddy, you can turn off the screen.
We know the lyrics.

404
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:44,612
<i>Everybody come and play.</i>

405
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,574
<i>Throw every last care away.</i>

406
00:20:49,157 --> 00:20:52,030
<i>Let's go to the mall</i>

407
00:20:52,472 --> 00:20:53,996
<i>today!</i>
