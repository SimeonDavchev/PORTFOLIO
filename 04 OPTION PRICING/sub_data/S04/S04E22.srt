1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:03,837
<i>In May of 2009,
I was on the verge of scoring</i>

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,583
<i>my first big client
as an independent architect.</i>

3
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,790
<i>I was willing to do anything
to make it happen.</i>

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,843
Here's what we want, son.
It's real simple.

5
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:14,250
We're opening a restaurant
called Rib Town

6
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:16,615
and we want it to be shaped

7
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:18,466
like a cowboy hat.

8
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:20,493
<i>Anything.</i>

9
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:21,765
A cowboy hat?

10
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,155
That's brilliant.

11
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:25,341
I love it!

12
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,643
I mean, nothing says delicious
like the inside of a cowboy hat, right?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,026
Look, I'm telling you, I'm your guy.

14
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:35,125
I think I was born
to design this building.

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,250
I just...

16
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:37,562
I see it.

17
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:40,822
I don't see it. I don't see it.
I don't see it.

18
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:43,407
What's so good about it?

19
00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:44,948
Up all night?

20
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:47,211
I told these guys
I have a vision for this thing.

21
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:49,750
They want to see a pitch
in a week and I got nothing.

22
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:51,958
- It's cute.
- Cute?

23
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:56,462
I could be designing concert halls
and bridges.

24
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,506
Bridges so beautiful
they could be in museums.

25
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:02,009
And I could design those museums.

26
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:05,535
But what am I designing instead?
What has my career come to?

27
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,545
A two-story Stetson
with outdoor dining on the brim.

28
00:01:10,623 --> 00:01:12,589
It's a sick cosmic joke.

29
00:01:12,714 --> 00:01:14,564
The universe
is conspiring against me.

30
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,504
You just need to get out of the house.
Take a walk. Get a bagel.

31
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,182
Yeah, that'll solve everything.

32
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:24,117
I haven't slept for 34 hours,
but a bagel is the answer.

33
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:27,201
A cinnamon raisin bagel
with a little cream cheese.

34
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:30,037
That sounds pretty good,
I'm going to get a bagel.

35
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:32,373
Bring an umbrella.
It's supposed to rain,

36
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:34,208
according to Galoshes,
our weather clown.

37
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:36,716
Your show has a clown
who does the weather?

38
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:38,305
That's a little cheesy, no?

39
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:42,864
And what's that restaurant
you're designing shaped like, Hoss?

40
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:45,881
Fine.
You want me out of the house,

41
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,680
I'll get out of the house.

42
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:51,698
Can't wait to see what the universe
has lined up for me out there.

43
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:59,202
<i>Kids, I've been telling you
the story of how I met your mother.</i>

44
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,692
<i>And while there's many things
to learn from this story,</i>

45
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,517
<i>this may be the biggest.</i>

46
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:07,283
<i>The great moments of your life
won't necessarily be the things you do.</i>

47
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:10,086
<i>They'll also be the things
that happen to you.</i>

48
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:13,289
<i>I'm not saying you can't take action
to affect the outcome of your life.</i>

49
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:16,406
<i>You have to take action,
and you will.</i>

50
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:19,546
<i>But never forget that, on any day,</i>

51
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:23,161
<i>you could step out the front door
and your whole life can change forever.</i>

52
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:26,356
<i>You see,
the universe has a plan, kids,</i>

53
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,429
<i>and that plan is always in motion.</i>

54
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,523
<i>A butterfly flaps its wings,</i>

55
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,114
<i>and it starts to rain.</i>

56
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,592
<i>It's a scary thought.
But it's also kind of wonderful.</i>

57
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,851
<i>All these little parts of the machine
constantly working,</i>

58
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:43,805
<i>making sure that you end up
exactly where you're supposed to be,</i>

59
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,101
<i>exactly when you're supposed
to be there.</i>

60
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,031
<i>The right place...
at the right time.</i>

61
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:09,290
<i>Kids, it's a miracle
that I ended up on that street corner.</i>

62
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:12,455
<i>Especially when you consider how easy
it would have been not to end up there.</i>

63
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:15,031
<i>I mean, when I first
stepped out of the apartment,</i>

64
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,380
<i>I almost went right instead of left.</i>

65
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:18,765
<i>Why didn't I go right?</i>

66
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,829
<i>To answer that,
we have to go back a few days.</i>

67
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,249
<i>As you know, back then,
your Aunt Robin hosted a morning show.</i>

68
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,787
Now Eunice here
makes all of these purses herself.

69
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:30,778
They're hand embroidered
with the world's finest silk.

70
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:33,235
And each one takes months to make.

71
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,448
I cannot emphasize
how much work goes into...

72
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,058
Go to weather, you idiot.

73
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:45,503
Hey, everybody.

74
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:48,398
We got a high pressure system
coming in from the west and...

75
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:54,376
On the plus side,
I bought the cutest purse today.

76
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,739
So, wait, why did you throw up?

77
00:03:57,592 --> 00:03:59,742
- You don't want to know.
- Come on. Tell me.

78
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,170
I'm pregnant.

79
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:05,579
I will raise this child with you.
You are not alone in this.

80
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,584
We can even get married if you want,
but I still want to see other girls,

81
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,078
- it would've to be one of those kind...
- God, stop it.

82
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:13,590
I'm not pregnant.
It's food poisoning.

83
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,336
I ate something from this place,

84
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:21,097
and three hours later,
I was spewing like an open hydrant.

85
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:24,684
- God. From where?
- Well, that's a gross question.

86
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:26,478
No, where was the food from?

87
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,939
- I don't want to tell you.
- What?

88
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:33,135
Go to YouTube. Put in
"Robin Scherbatsky morning show vomit"

89
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,652
Robin, home so soon.

90
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:37,322
Someone already put it on YouTube?

91
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:39,344
Yeah... Someone.

92
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:43,620
So...
Why you been throwing up? You pregnant?

93
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:45,622
Yeah, Barney. I'm pregnant.

94
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:52,772
So, wait, why won't you tell me
where you got food poisoning?

95
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,965
You love this place.
If I tell you, it'll just ruin it.

96
00:04:57,744 --> 00:04:59,523
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

97
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:00,898
Don't tell me.

98
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,079
Is it that Indian place where the cat
jumps on all the tables?

99
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:05,141
I'm not saying.

100
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,331
- That Spanish place with baby's crib?
- I'm not saying.

101
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,292
God, no.

102
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,984
Is it this place?
Tell me, damn you!

103
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:17,352
- You really want to know?
- Yes!

104
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:19,866
It's Schlegel's Bagels.

105
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:21,741
Why did you tell me that?

106
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:25,072
Schlegel's? Thanks a lot, Robin.

107
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:27,712
Now I'm gonna have to try to find
another place in NY

108
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:29,373
that serves bagels.

109
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:34,291
<i>So, you see, kids, if I had gone
to Schlegel's Bagels as usual,</i>

110
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,047
<i>I would have taken a right.</i>

111
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,583
<i>I would have gotten a bagel</i>

112
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,802
<i>gone home,
worked on the old hat building,</i>

113
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,429
<i>and you kids
might never have been born.</i>

114
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:47,816
<i>But I turned left instead, to go
to my second-favorite bagel place</i>

115
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,996
<i>and the rest is history.</i>

116
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:53,247
<i>Of course, I stopped
at that magazine stand on the way.</i>

117
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:55,858
<i>Why did I stop there?
Here's why.</i>

118
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:03,482
<i>Bro's Life</i> magazine.

119
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:06,228
Page 83. Check it.

120
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,576
"What your paintball gun says
about your personality"?

121
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,701
Below that.

122
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,794
"That last five pounds:
How to get her to lose them."

123
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:16,212
Above that.

124
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:18,548
Petra Petrova.

125
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:24,345
<i>Bro's Life</i> magazine's
girl of the year for may.

126
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,612
A delicate flower in stiletto pumps
and leopard panties,

127
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,058
straddling an ATV.

128
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:32,228
These magazines are so lame. I mean,
she's probably airbrushed and enhanced.

129
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:35,466
- I have a date with her.
- You are my hero! Are you serious?

130
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:38,257
- How do you have a date with her?
- Not part of the story.

131
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:41,378
Ted, I have been waiting
a long time to say this.

132
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:44,136
This girl is the one.

133
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,634
Of course she's the one.
You have to marry those.

134
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,759
Her.

135
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:50,072
Marry?

136
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:55,335
I have something much,
much more special in mind.

137
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,162
Petra here, if all goes well,

138
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,555
will be my...
wait for it, two hundredth.

139
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,425
Sorry, I couldn't wait.
It's all exciting.

140
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:05,595
Your two hundredth,
as in "sex with"?

141
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,283
As in "sex with."

142
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:10,183
I request the highest of fives.

143
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:13,061
Not if I was wearing a Hazmat suit.

144
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,576
200 is too many.

145
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:20,243
Right, 'cause there can be
too many of something wonderful.

146
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:23,363
"Babe Ruth, easy, big fella.
Let's not hit too many homers."

147
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:27,477
"Steve Guttenberg, maybe just make
three Police Academy movies."

148
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:29,243
"America's laughed enough."

149
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,787
Who are these girls?

150
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,164
That was rhetorical.
Don't show me the list.

151
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:36,417
199 satisfied customers.

152
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,920
Anyway, the big night is Thursday.

153
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:41,964
I'm having a celebratory soirée
beforehand at MacLaren's.

154
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,699
Prepare a toast.
Black tie optional, but preferred.

155
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:49,158
Gifts are, look, I would say
unnecessary, but follow your heart.

156
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:50,807
200's too many.

157
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,809
- It's not too many.
- It's too many!

158
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,103
- It's not too many.
- Thank you.

159
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:56,515
No, don't get me wrong.

160
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,233
You're disgusting, and the cops should
probably clamp a boot on your genitals,

161
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:02,592
but that number should be higher.

162
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:05,611
After Barney told me about all this,
I crunched the numbers and,

163
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,736
well...

164
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:08,324
I had some charts made up.

165
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:12,829
Barney here
hits on roughly 20 girls a week.

166
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:17,066
It's way more than 20.
And B. Smooth don't do nothing roughly.

167
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,290
Let's say 20.
So, 20 girls a week means

168
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:22,922
1,040 girls a year.

169
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,765
In Barney's 16 years
of sexual activity,

170
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,887
that means he's hit on 16,640 girls.

171
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:32,934
Now, if he's bedded 199 of them,

172
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,959
that is a success rate of

173
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:40,022
a little over one percent.

174
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:42,859
That's a batting average of 12,

175
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:46,368
eight times worse than
the career batting average of

176
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,903
one-handed pitcher, that's right,

177
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,197
pitcher... Jim Abbott.

178
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:55,108
Jealous.

179
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:56,403
Jealous.

180
00:08:56,655 --> 00:08:57,655
Hero.

181
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:00,081
Suspiciously quiet
during this conversation

182
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,837
about number of sex partners. Hero.

183
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,048
It's the grand total.
That's the only number that matters.

184
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:08,266
- Says who?
- Matthew Panning,

185
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:11,512
the stud of Port Richmond
Middle School.

186
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,103
Stinson, you're such a dweeb-o.

187
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:16,017
I bet you never
even done it with a girl.

188
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,585
Neither have you.

189
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,956
How many times do I have
to explain this?

190
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:21,567
I've done it with 100 girls.

191
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:24,192
They're seventh graders
at my cousin's school on Long Island.

192
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:27,904
Well, you know what, Matthew?
Someday, I'm gonna do it with 200.

193
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:31,699
Yeah. Call me when that happens.

194
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,448
And call him I will.

195
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,831
I think he's gonna say it again
really slow.

196
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:41,046
Call him...

197
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:43,316
I will.

198
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:48,887
You listed Gaby Allan twice,
as 78 and 162.

199
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:50,834
What? Let me see.

200
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,009
Seventy...

201
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,849
Once. Oh, my God.

202
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,095
Wait a...
I counted the same girl twice?

203
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,519
That means I'm only at one 198?

204
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:03,474
That only means that you're half
a percent less gross than we thought.

205
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,777
I'm seducing
a Czech supermodel in two hours.

206
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:09,193
I can't squander that on 199.

207
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,242
Petra has to be 200.

208
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,742
What are you gonna do? It's not
like you're gonna find someone new

209
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:17,953
to have sex with
in the next two hours.

210
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,699
Hi, millionaire astronaut.
Want to come back to my place

211
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:22,341
- and see some moon shells?
- Go away.

212
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,788
I just got back from my wife's grave.
Put her in the ground a year ago today.

213
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,796
Man, I miss her.
I sure could use some comfort.

214
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,131
You're creepy.

215
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,013
Man, aren't you sick of all the games?
I just want to settle down

216
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:34,324
and have a gaggle
of rug rats, like, right now.

217
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:37,054
I have Mace, and I enjoy using it.

218
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:44,203
Knowing how important this is to me,
do you think Lily would even consider...

219
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:46,836
- By the way, I would do all the work...
- I will end your life.

220
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
Right.

221
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,338
Where'd Barney go?
It's been over an hour.

222
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,717
You know,
looking over the names on this list,

223
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:01,345
I'm not sensing a lot
of ethnic diversity.

224
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,429
He should really look
at that in himself.

225
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:07,850
All done.

226
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,472
199 down, one more to go.

227
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:12,217
You done with your drink?

228
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:16,076
There's the stuff.

229
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:19,725
What the hell happened to you?

230
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,232
So, there's this girl at my gym...

231
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,950
Pauline... she's been
after me for some time.

232
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:28,120
- Why'd you wait until now?
- She's not exactly my type.

233
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:30,539
Looking good, Pauline.

234
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:31,975
You are gonna rip it up

235
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,308
at the Women's Pumping Iron
Classic in Sarasota this fall.

236
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:43,445
I was thinking about you and me

237
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:47,391
and if you're still interested...

238
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:51,811
- Okay, blondie, time for Mama's cardio!
- Geez! Mommy!

239
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,607
Every inch of her

240
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:55,903
tasted like roast beef and creatine.

241
00:11:58,319 --> 00:11:59,469
But I did it.

242
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:02,920
I did it and I still have 30 minutes
before I'm supposed to meet Petra.

243
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:04,900
Robin, do you have
any concealer handy?

244
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,576
I'd really like to cover up
some bruises and razor burn.

245
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:13,123
- I hate to break this to you, but...
- What?

246
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,550
Well, you did count
Gaby Allan twice,

247
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:20,662
but... you also went
from 138 to 138.

248
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:22,174
You used the same number twice.

249
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:24,095
Wait, so, that means...

250
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:27,339
Pauline wasn't 199, Pauline was 200?

251
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:29,056
Congratulations!

252
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,380
No... That was supposed to be Petra!

253
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:34,284
Petra was supposed to be 200!

254
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:37,931
Gorgeous, feminine, "Doesn't wear
a weight belt in bed," Petra!

255
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:40,754
Hey, come on.
You made it to 200.

256
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,430
You should be proud.

257
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:45,364
You should be tested,
but you should be proud.

258
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,826
Who cares if Pauline doesn't
pose for bikini pictures in magazines?

259
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,372
Actually, she does.

260
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:53,330
She's gonna be in next week's
issue of <i>Muscle Sexxy</i>.

261
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,745
And like many of the ladies
in that magazine,

262
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,153
Sexxy has two X's and one Y.

263
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:02,687
<i>And so, on my way to get a bagel,</i>

264
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:04,812
<i>I stopped at a news stand
for a full minute</i>

265
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:07,198
<i>to check out a picture
of Barney's 200th.</i>

266
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:10,139
<i>If I hadn't done that,</i>

267
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,224
<i>I would've walked right
by the news stand,</i>

268
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,351
<i>cut down 77th and gotten to
that corner a minute early.</i>

269
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:18,109
<i>I would've gotten the bagel,
done some work,</i>

270
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,608
<i>and you kids might
never have been born.</i>

271
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,613
<i>Now, why did I cut down 77th,</i>

272
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,552
<i>and give a dollar to the homeless guy?
Here's why.</i>

273
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:28,490
<i>Back when Marshall first started working
at Goliath National Bank...</i>

274
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,753
Fran, I don't mean to bother you
but I have a big presentation tomorrow

275
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:37,431
and it would really help if I could get
like some charts and graphs made up.

276
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,519
- Could you help me with that?
- This is the graphics department.

277
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:43,299
We can make as many graphs,
as many charts in as many colors

278
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:45,288
on as many kinds
of paper as you want.

279
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,171
We are gonna have some fun.

280
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:57,978
I've ranked the Presidents
in order of how dirty their names sound.

281
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:00,082
One: Johnson.

282
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:01,982
Two: Bush.

283
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:04,013
Three: Harding.

284
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:05,736
Four: Polk.

285
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,991
This circle represents
"People Who Are Breaking My Heart..."

286
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:13,763
And this circle represents.

287
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:16,757
"People Who Are Shaking
My Confidence Daily."

288
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,925
And where they overlap:

289
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,074
Cecilia.

290
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:26,882
This is a pie chart
describing my favorite bars.

291
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:33,382
And this is a bar graph
describing my favorite pies.

292
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:41,772
What's going on?

293
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:43,210
Enough with the charts.

294
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:44,585
And the graphs.

295
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:47,861
Really any visual
representation of data.

296
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,648
I'm not an idiot.

297
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:55,563
I know how you guys feel
about my charts and my graphs.

298
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,806
As a matter of fact, I've made a chart
of your reaction to my charts.

299
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,445
Let's take a look.
Yes, it is true,

300
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,849
since Cecelia,
your interest in my charts

301
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:05,524
has been steadily dropping.

302
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:07,631
But based on recent trends,

303
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:09,151
I have also made...

304
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:11,719
A projection chart!

305
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:14,467
And look...
huge spike in interest coming!

306
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:16,940
And this isn't just
some dead cat bounce.

307
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:20,436
This is big sustainable growth
over the long term.

308
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:22,478
You're a big sustainable growth.

309
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:28,347
So, I have prepared a few charts

310
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,379
to demonstrate how setting up
a shell corporation in Bermuda

311
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:34,700
could help minimize
our second quarter losses.

312
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:37,619
And save you all some jail time.

313
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:40,835
To begin with...

314
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,904
Could you just please excuse me?

315
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:55,596
- Mosbius Designs.
- What the hell happened to my charts?

316
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:57,597
- We threw them away.
- What?

317
00:15:57,849 --> 00:15:59,464
That's how an intervention works.

318
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:02,227
You wouldn't stop using,
so, we flushed your stash.

319
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,538
Come on, Ted!

320
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,916
I need my charts, man!

321
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,788
Just for today and then I promise
I will never ever use charts again.

322
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,527
I'm under at lot of pressure here.
I need my charts, Jack!

323
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:13,238
My God, you're doing charts at work?

324
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:16,570
They're for work, you idiot!
I'm giving a big presentation right now

325
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:18,775
and if I don't have
those charts I'm gonna get fired!

326
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,711
Crap.

327
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,915
Stay right there.
I'll bring them to you.

328
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,581
Hurry up! I'll try to think
of a way to stall them.

329
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:31,055
I'm sorry but there's been
a little delay with the charts.

330
00:16:31,094 --> 00:16:34,102
But we will get started
in just a minute.

331
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:42,017
Fish are weird, right?

332
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:45,025
I mean what's up with fish?

333
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,028
Charts! Get your charts here!

334
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:59,535
Excuse me, Milt?
I think those are my charts.

335
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:02,378
These charts? On my blanket?

336
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,491
That's also my blanket.
We'll get to that later.

337
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:08,804
- But I really need these charts.
- Good, 'cause they're for sale.

338
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:10,546
Fine, how much?

339
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:13,132
One million dollars.

340
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,468
- I'll give you five bucks.
- A million dollars.

341
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,638
No one's gonna pay
a million dollars for these charts!

342
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,266
One million dollars.

343
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:23,935
Okay, Milt, you win.

344
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:27,312
I'm gonna give you
one million dollars.

345
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:29,472
Urinating...

346
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:31,650
The problem is, the ATM...

347
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,318
The alien time machine.

348
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:37,121
The alien time machine
has a withdrawal limit.

349
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:40,269
So, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you one dollar

350
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:41,482
a day

351
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:43,640
for a million days.

352
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:46,087
That's...

353
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,542
That's 2700 years.

354
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:50,927
Deal!

355
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:55,132
Sucker.

356
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:59,210
I'm sorry, is there a land bass
I don't know about?

357
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,297
Let's get started.

358
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:07,019
<i>And so, if I hadn't bought
those charts back for Marshall,</i>

359
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:08,797
<i>I wouldn't have had to cut down 77th</i>

360
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,425
<i>to give Milt his daily dollar</i>

361
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,533
<i>and well, you know the rest.</i>

362
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,720
<i>So, there you have it, kids.
There's a lot of little reasons</i>

363
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:17,800
<i>why the big things
in our lives happen.</i>

364
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:20,554
<i>If I had known then where
all those little things were leading me,</i>

365
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,806
<i>and how grateful
I'd be to get there,</i>

366
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:25,546
<i>well, I probably
would've done something</i>

367
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:27,182
<i>like this.</i>

368
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:10,123
<i>Because somehow, I ended up
in the right place at the right time.</i>

369
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,975
<i>And, as a result,</i>

370
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:14,378
<i>my life would never be the same.</i>

371
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:32,989
<i>The next day, Uncle Barney
finally confronted Matthew Panning,</i>

372
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:35,106
<i>the stud of Port Richmond
Middle School.</i>

373
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:38,030
So, Barney, great to hear
from you after all this time.

374
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:41,263
- What's been going on?
- I've had sex with 200 women.

375
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:44,951
God!

376
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:46,356
That's way too many.

377
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:48,270
I mean, that's just gross.

378
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:50,513
Have you sought counseling
for sex addiction?

379
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,232
Because you're a prime candidate.

380
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:54,692
Have you sought counseling
for I win you lose?

381
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,153
Yeah, suddenly those 100 girls

382
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:00,115
you nailed in the seventh grade
aren't so impressive.

383
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:01,422
100 girls?

384
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,286
Is that what this is about?
Barney, I lied.

385
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:05,987
Sure you did.

386
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,354
I was 12... of course I was lying.

387
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,584
I didn't have a pet Ewok either.

388
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:11,960
Sure you didn't.

389
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:15,587
Your whole adult life
has been built around

390
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:18,342
something I lied about
when I was 12?

391
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:20,177
Jealous?

392
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:23,013
Look, I gotta go pick
my kids up at school.

393
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:25,760
It sounds like you got
a lot of problems.

394
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,555
Good luck, I guess.

395
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:30,981
I'm awesome.

396
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,122
200.

397
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:37,882
Now what?
