1
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:04,130
Barney is crazy if he thinks
this is gonna work.

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:06,683
- I think it's gonna work.
- I hope it doesn't work.

3
00:00:07,018 --> 00:00:08,340
Here he comes.

4
00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:14,270
- You there, what's your name?
- Excuse me?

5
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:16,500
Your name, woman,
what's your name?!

6
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:18,767
- Cindy.
- I knew it.

7
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:22,687
You're the Cindy,
the one who can change everything,

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,144
or spell our inevitable doom.

9
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:27,266
<i>Now listen to me, Cindy.</i>

10
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:28,834
I am Barney Stinson,

11
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:32,098
and I am on an urgent mission
from the future.

12
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:33,018
The future?

13
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:35,234
The future,
and I can prove it to you.

14
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,633
In exactly four seconds,

15
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,845
the woman at that booth
is going to slap that man.

16
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,407
What the hell?

17
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:46,252
In a few minutes,

18
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:51,045
the young me from your time
is going to come through that door.

19
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:54,219
Now, Cindy,
I know this sounds insane,

20
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:57,117
but in order to save the planet,

21
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:00,695
You need to sleep with him tonight.

22
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,530
What?

23
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:06,469
Sleep with Barney Stinson tonight,
in whatever way he wants it,

24
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:08,891
or he won't be able
to find the solution

25
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:11,990
to global warming
that saves the human race.

26
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:14,956
- What are you talking about?
- I have no time to explain.

27
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:17,378
I have to get back
to the reality accelerator

28
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,200
before the vortex closes.

29
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:23,073
Only you can save us, Cindy.

30
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:24,425
I must away!

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,566
Okay, guys,
the movers are coming in 14 hours.

32
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:30,773
We gotta get back upstairs
and finish packing.

33
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,491
You guys still aren't finished packing?

34
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:34,211
How is this taking so long?

35
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,657
Hey, all the great memories

36
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:37,732
of our 20s took place
in that apartment.

37
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:39,451
It's not like throwing stuff in a box.

38
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:40,775
You start to reminisce.

39
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,211
Not me. The key?

40
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,791
Throw stuff out and never look back.

41
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:46,069
I'm moving to Japan.
It took me a half hour to pack.

42
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:46,989
A half hour?

43
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:48,486
Well, it would have
taken me 20 minutes,

44
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,815
but a friend called me in tears.

45
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,388
Moving is really emotional, okay?

46
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:53,630
It is.

47
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,396
I mean, everything is changing.

48
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,212
I'm gonna be living in New Jersey
with Stella,

49
00:01:57,236 --> 00:01:58,636
you guys will be in your new place.

50
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:01,011
You're starting a new job in Tokyo.

51
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,814
It's the end of an era.

52
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:05,894
I think we should have a toast,
but not our usual crap.

53
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,260
Hey... Wendy, your most
expensive bottle of scotch.

54
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,317
That's 50-year-old Glen McKenna,
and it's $2,500.

55
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,022
Excellent.
A bottle of that with beer chasers,

56
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:17,890
and what do you think,
cancel the scotch?

57
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,421
Vodka rocks.

58
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:23,984
It's not gonna work.

59
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:25,051
Oh, my God!

60
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,563
You're...

61
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:27,685
Oh, my God!

62
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:29,891
Can I buy you a drink?

63
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:34,596
I suppose I have time
for one drink and

64
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,669
45 minutes to an hour
of some other activity,

65
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,749
<i>but after that,
I have to get back to</i>

66
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,611
a top-secret research project
I'm working on.

67
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:44,339
Global warming?

68
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,857
My God, how did you know that?

69
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:03,644
Hey, look at this.

70
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:06,330
A photo from the first day
we moved into this place.

71
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:09,860
So many great memories.

72
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,926
See? That is exactly the type of crap
you should be trashing.

73
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:16,016
So you don't keep any photos?

74
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,729
No, they're like
love letters or yearbooks

75
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:20,917
or someone's ashes,
they just take up space.

76
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,863
Besides, Stella's not gonna let you
keep half of this junk.

77
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:24,988
Why wouldn't she?

78
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:28,453
Ted, oh, sweetie.

79
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:29,978
Okay, here's the thing that guys

80
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:32,554
only learn after they move in
with a woman.

81
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,553
All of your stuff is stupid.

82
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:36,097
Like what?

83
00:03:36,572 --> 00:03:39,449
Like anything you bought
at a Renaissance faire.

84
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:42,087
There's not enough
mead in the world

85
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,778
to make me get rid of my flail.

86
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,814
Since we're clearly not getting
our security deposit back,

87
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:49,957
I thought maybe
you could reimburse me for my half.

88
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,371
Wait a second, why should I
have to pay more than you?

89
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,478
Because you treated
this apartment the way

90
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,592
John Bonham treated
his central nervous system.

91
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,282
That's not true.

92
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,840
Exhibit a.

93
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:05,013
What's that?

94
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:08,209
A 1986 world book encyclopaedia.

95
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,021
It's exactly the one I grew up with.

96
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:11,486
Encyclopaedia?

97
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,164
You think it should be pronounced
encyclo-pee-dia.

98
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:16,696
It's a common mistake.

99
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:20,808
But if you look at that squished together
"ae" symbol in this here Encyclopaedia,

100
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,452
you'll learn that it's a ligature

101
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,965
derived from the anglo-saxon rune...

102
00:04:31,707 --> 00:04:34,197
You know,
you're gonna have to paedia for that.

103
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:36,654
But you never did,

104
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:39,290
and then, there's exhibit b.

105
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:45,133
Good morrow, fair gentles.

106
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,725
Look what I won
at the renaissance faire.

107
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,104
And you're also responsible
for any damage

108
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:56,048
Robin did when she was your girlfriend.

109
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,224
What damage did I cause?

110
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,588
Do you remember that night
when you drank the 12'er of Molson

111
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,756
and you got all super canadian?

112
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,996
Stanley cup, game six A.

113
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,306
The Rangers are about to be sorry.

114
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,307
They ever played shinny
with the Canucks.

115
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:13,969
- Hey, hey, Robin.
- Yeah?

116
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:16,835
I'll give you 20 bucks if you
can shoot it through this front door.

117
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,561
You're nuttier than
a Tim Horton's maple log.

118
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:22,180
Timmy ho!

119
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:26,668
That's it, Robin.
Give me the stick.

120
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:28,631
I'll give you summer teeth.

121
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,854
Some are here, some are there.

122
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,642
Robin, give me the stick.

123
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,792
Take off,

124
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:37,028
- hoser.
- That's it!

125
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:39,816
Scrap?! I'll scrap!

126
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:42,004
- Guys, come on!
- For America.

127
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,487
All right, break it, break it up!

128
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,799
Ted, no!

129
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,230
You never break up a girl fight!

130
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,558
Never!

131
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,485
Entirely Barney's fault.

132
00:05:56,588 --> 00:06:00,139
As, by the way, is the big
scorch mark over the fireplace.

133
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,862
<i>Kids, to understand the story
of the scorch mark,</i>

134
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:06,483
<i>I first need to tell you the story of</i>

135
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:08,394
<i>the intervention
for our friend Stewart.</i>

136
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:09,657
What's going on?

137
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,036
Stewart, this is an intervention.

138
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:16,641
The alcohol changes you, Stewart.

139
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,923
It makes you a different person.

140
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:22,153
And I'm in love
with the man that I married.

141
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:24,152
Thank you.

142
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:27,251
This is just the push I need.

143
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,293
I love you guys.

144
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:35,097
Hey, hey! There's the birthday boy.

145
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,654
Time to let the party monster out
of its cage, Stewie!

146
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:41,555
Come on, buddy.

147
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:44,139
People don't want to see
Bruce Banner, dude.

148
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,613
They want to see the hulk.

149
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:48,924
Hulk, hulk, hulk... what?

150
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,997
That's what I get for skimming
the e-vite.

151
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:03,254
<i>Later that day, we celebrated
our first successful intervention.</i>

152
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:05,651
I am really proud of us
for helping Stewart.

153
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:09,238
Yeah, what an amazing
honest, human moment.

154
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,332
I agree. Yay us.

155
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:14,582
Marshall, are you really
gonna keep wearing that hat?

156
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,507
Yeah, it's been two weeks, Marshall.

157
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,498
Two awesome weeks...

158
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,983
And heck, yeah,
I'm gonna keep wearing it.

159
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,569
The next day.

160
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,457
Marshall,

161
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,865
this is an intervention.

162
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:36,142
It's about the hat.

163
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,024
I have it under control, okay?

164
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:43,496
I can take it off
whenever I want to.

165
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,444
Dear Marshall,

166
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:49,656
I do not like that stupid hat.

167
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,924
I want to beat it with a bat.

168
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:54,654
Or maybe stab it with a fork.

169
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,352
It makes you look like such a dork.

170
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:59,402
<i>After that,</i>

171
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:02,885
<i>Interventions became a pretty
regular thing around our apartment.</i>

172
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,594
Cor blimey.

173
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:10,985
This is a nice bloody surprise.
What's this about then?

174
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:12,539
Lily...

175
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:15,950
It's about the weird
fake english accent.

176
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:17,739
Bollocks.

177
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:25,495
Spray tan?

178
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:31,218
They reel you in with a coupon,
and then you just get hooked.

179
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:33,824
We know, sweetie, we know.

180
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,271
This is a new sweater.

181
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:40,138
What?

182
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:41,823
The magic tricks.

183
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:44,186
Specifically, those involving fire.

184
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:45,794
Magic tricks?

185
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,202
Guys, interventions
are supposed to help people,

186
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:52,334
not attack every little thing
you don't like about them.

187
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:55,142
I'm sorry, but
that really steams me.

188
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:57,659
That really burns me up!

189
00:08:58,382 --> 00:09:03,124
I mean, I am filled
with a white-hot rage!

190
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,047
Thank you.

191
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,235
Oh, shoot.
I smell hair! I smell hair!

192
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,516
<i>And that's the story
of the scorch mark.</i>

193
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,239
Wait, that's weird.

194
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,924
When I was going through the closet, I

195
00:09:19,948 --> 00:09:22,034
thought I saw the intervention banner.

196
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:23,736
So?

197
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,864
So, the banner burned up.
Why is there a new one?

198
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:30,893
And there are sealed letters here
from all of you that say "Ted."

199
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,724
Were you guys planning
an intervention for me?

200
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:36,124
That... that was stupid.

201
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:37,724
Yeah, just, just forget about that.

202
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,178
What was it for? The crocs?

203
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:42,901
- The hair product?
- Not Stella.

204
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:46,103
Oh, my God,
this was about Stella.

205
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:49,490
I just said "not Stella."

206
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,617
So maybe it was about
your poor listening skills, Ted.

207
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,701
- What?
- It's out of control. See?

208
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,091
You guys don't think
I should marry Stella?

209
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:03,991
You guys don't think
I should marry Stella?

210
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:05,437
Ted, we do.

211
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:06,948
We're all really happy for you.

212
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,873
Yeah. Like I said,
it was stupid.

213
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:10,511
Well, obviously, it wasn't,

214
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:12,835
Because we agreed not to have
any more stupid interventions

215
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,662
at our intervention intervention.

216
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:17,929
We're having too many interventions.

217
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:22,874
So, what was your big,
serious problem with me and Stella?

218
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:24,651
Yes!

219
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:27,083
Yes! In everyone's face!

220
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:29,275
You all said the "future barney" thing
wouldn't work.

221
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,052
You told me I was crazy.

222
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:33,803
My shrink told me I was crazy.

223
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:36,855
Well, who's the narcissist
with severe attachment disorder now,

224
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:38,376
Dr. Grossbard?!

225
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:42,370
Intervention banner?
What's that for?

226
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:48,755
"Ted, I cannot stand idly by..."

227
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,530
You've just been carrying that around?

228
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:51,652
Please, Ted?

229
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:54,975
"I cannot stand idly by
while you make

230
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,050
the biggest mistake any man can make

231
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:58,276
getting married.

232
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,556
"Mark my words, this whole thing
is gonna go up in flames!"

233
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:06,808
Damn!

234
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,099
I put the flame cue too early.

235
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:11,081
I had so many more
important things to say, and...

236
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,636
The point is, Ted,

237
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:16,260
marriage is stupid.

238
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:20,459
Every year, there are a million new

239
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,891
hot 22-year-olds walking into bars,

240
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:24,975
and call me "glass half full,"

241
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:27,069
but I think they're getting dumber.

242
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,514
Come on, Barney,

243
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:30,152
even you aren't still gonna be
hitting on

244
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:31,875
22-year-olds when you're 80.

245
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:35,500
- I accept that challenge.
- What challenge?

246
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:37,051
To prove to you

247
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,788
that I will be exactly
this awesome when I'm 80,

248
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:43,698
I will hook up with a 22-year-old

249
00:11:43,849 --> 00:11:45,605
while in my old-man makeup.

250
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,704
I didn't remotely challenge
you to that.

251
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:50,511
I mean, I definitely want to see it.

252
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:53,005
But I didn't remotely challenge
you to that.

253
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:55,324
I want to hear the other letters.

254
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,969
Ted, this is ridiculous.

255
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:58,481
We changed our minds.

256
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:00,359
And suppose you change them back?

257
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:02,115
Lily, come on, let's hear yours.

258
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,054
"Gilbert's reading skills
have improved drastically since..."

259
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:11,240
Wait,

260
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:14,749
this is a letter I meant to send home
with one of my kindergarteners.

261
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:17,392
Gilbert,

262
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,921
are things moving too fast

263
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,874
between you and a girl named Stella?

264
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:22,517
I wish.

265
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:27,871
Robin, could I hear yours?

266
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:37,664
"Dear Ted, it's 'encyclo-pee-dia,
not 'encyclo-pay-dia."

267
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:41,141
Why do you always say things
in the most pretentious way possible?

268
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,718
It makes you sound douchey

269
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,662
"and that's 'douchey,
not 'douch-ay.'"

270
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,086
Yeah, you already read that one
at my pronunciation intervention.

271
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:51,086
Where's the letter about Stella?

272
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,230
I didn't write one...
I'm your ex-girlfriend.

273
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:56,134
I figured anything I said on the subject
would sound catty.

274
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:59,383
Plus, I'm hotter than her,
so who cares?

275
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,346
Marshall?

276
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:03,841
Dude, it's water under
the bridge.

277
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:04,991
- Please.
- And we just...

278
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:13,486
"Dear Ted,

279
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:16,655
Stella seems like a wonderful person.

280
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:21,395
But you don't know
her well enough to get married,

281
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:23,794
you certainly don't know her
well enough to

282
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:26,629
commit to raising
a seven-year-old with her.

283
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,108
You're not doing her,

284
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:33,581
her child or yourself any favors
by rushing into this.

285
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:36,632
"Just give it some more time."

286
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:40,349
Dude, that was
months ago, all right?

287
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:42,897
That was before we got to know Stella
and see how

288
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,855
awesome she is
and what a great couple you guys are.

289
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:48,597
That's why we decided not
to even have that intervention.

290
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:49,784
Thank you.

291
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,026
Because I really need you guys
to be on board with this.

292
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,050
And we are.

293
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:54,680
And we hope
you're not mad at us.

294
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,792
Course not.

295
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,295
I mean, it's not like what
you said was crazy.

296
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,180
You had a lot of valid concerns.

297
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:04,457
Yeah, but concerns
we have completely moved on from.

298
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:05,978
But you had a point.

299
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,870
I mean, this whole thing has moved
pretty fast.

300
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:09,811
Well, you know what?

301
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,191
Maybe that's because

302
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,890
when it's right, you just know.

303
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,395
Yeah, I guess,
but-but we are still,

304
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,395
you know,
getting to know each other.

305
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:18,928
And, Lily, maybe you're right.

306
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:21,573
Maybe Stella won't like any
of my stuff.

307
00:14:22,643 --> 00:14:24,878
Like the robot cookie jar.

308
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:26,882
This was, like,
the first thing we bought

309
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:27,949
for this place, remember?

310
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:29,263
Of course I do.

311
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:30,759
Marshall,

312
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:33,867
my sensors indicate
that your pecan sandy levels

313
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,923
are dangerously low.

314
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,495
My collection of James Bond movies.

315
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:42,647
Remember? We watched them all
in order, and then...

316
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:45,934
Lily spoke in that weird english accent
for, like, the next month?

317
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:47,956
- It was sophisticated.
- No.

318
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:52,538
My signed Bernie Kosar cleats.

319
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,313
My elephant lamp.

320
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:56,369
The english phone booth.

321
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,917
My sombrero!

322
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:01,504
Ted, what are you doing?

323
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,055
Unpacking.
I'm never leaving this apartment.

324
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,074
Ted, stop unpacking.

325
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,548
You're just freaking out.

326
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:18,102
I'm not ready
for all the responsibility,

327
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,627
and I'm certainly not ready to be
a step-dad

328
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:22,232
to a seven-year-old.

329
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:24,634
I mean, if I get married
and move to the suburbs,

330
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,419
in the blink of an eye,
I've become an old man!

331
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,466
Why, hello, young lady.

332
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,462
You want a butterscotch candy?

333
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:37,816
What do you mean,
"nothing in common"?

334
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,572
We're both seniors.

335
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:44,699
You're cute.

336
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:46,206
How old are you?

337
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:48,058
83.

338
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:49,338
How old are you?

339
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:50,447
31.

340
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:56,219
Okay, Ted has officially snapped.

341
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,515
There are moving men coming
in ten hours.

342
00:15:58,618 --> 00:16:00,909
His fiance is waiting for him
in New Jersey.

343
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:02,534
We have to do something.

344
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:03,820
I got this.

345
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:08,574
Hey, Bud.

346
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,439
Why don't you come here for a minute.

347
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:12,499
What?

348
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:16,250
Look, I want you to know
this is all totally normal.

349
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:19,566
Big transitions can be scary, and
cold feet

350
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,689
well they're just part of the deal.

351
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:25,500
So... how about you give me the knife?

352
00:16:26,054 --> 00:16:27,458
Give me the knife.

353
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:29,122
Come on.

354
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,408
So I can start unpacking, too.

355
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,877
I'm staying here right by your side
forever, buddy!

356
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:37,783
Marshall!

357
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,646
Lily, our lives have been good here.

358
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:42,578
That's why we've been putting off
packing.

359
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:44,000
Because subconsciously,

360
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:46,141
we both know that it would be
stupid to leave.

361
00:16:46,216 --> 00:16:48,207
It's safe and warm here. There's a

362
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,118
a bar downstairs,
and a cookie robot in the kitchen.

363
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,127
This is my home,
and I'm never leaving!

364
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,253
Listen to you!

365
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:56,854
You sound like that fat,
dweeby kid at camp.

366
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:58,816
"Mom, dad, I want to come home.

367
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:01,483
The cool kids are playing keep-away
with my inhaler."

368
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,907
I can't believe my dad
read that letter at our wedding.

369
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,001
Marshall, you can't do this to Lily.

370
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:08,217
Yes, I know your new place
has had some problems,

371
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:11,438
with the slanted floors and
the nearby sewage treatment plant, but

372
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:14,064
you're gonna turn it into a great home.

373
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,219
Tell him, Lily.

374
00:17:15,313 --> 00:17:17,867
It's a black hole
where dreams go to die.

375
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:19,276
I'm not moving, either.

376
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,684
- Oh, come on!
- Yes!

377
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:22,853
Okay, you guys finish unpacking.

378
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:25,938
I'm gonna go bake some cookies
to fill r2-sweet tooth.

379
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:29,159
Oh, my god, look at you cowards!

380
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,478
So afraid of any kind of change.

381
00:17:31,582 --> 00:17:33,450
So terrified of anything new.

382
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:34,712
So desperate

383
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,068
to cling to anything
comfortable and familiar.

384
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:39,078
I can't move to Japan.

385
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:41,951
What was I thinking?

386
00:17:42,036 --> 00:17:45,059
It's so far away.
And I don't speak the language.

387
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:47,493
I didn't even have any good pictures
of you guys.

388
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:48,831
Sweetie.

389
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:52,178
Everybody says
change is so great, right?

390
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,765
But what's so great about change?

391
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:56,520
Hey, who wants to walk down
to our same old bar,

392
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:58,913
sit in our regular booth
and order the usual?!

393
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:02,490
Yeah! The usual! My favorite!

394
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:06,920
Oh, my god.

395
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,994
Well, well, well.

396
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:17,980
I believe someone owes me $200.

397
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:20,061
Barney, this was never a bet...
nobody...

398
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:24,145
This proves that I will be this awesome
when I'm 80.

399
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:26,068
Arthritis five.

400
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,819
I'm moving to New Jersey.

401
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:31,645
What?

402
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,772
And you and Marshall should move
to your new place,

403
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:35,323
and Robin should go to Japan.

404
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:36,187
Why?

405
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,957
Because we're gonna get older
whether we like it or not,

406
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:42,581
So the only question is whether
we want to get on with our lives

407
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:46,331
or desperately cling to the past
and end up like that.

408
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:48,357
You mean awesome?

409
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:53,299
I'm 80, dude,
and I'm making out with a 22-year-old.

410
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:56,351
Take me to your place, cheri.

411
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,999
I want to see your world war 2 medals.

412
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,477
In a minute, mon petite.

413
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,928
All right, so that doesn't count.

414
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:05,191
What? Why?

415
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:08,181
She's french... that's like
playing tennis with the net down.

416
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:10,045
You know what?

417
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,101
I'll cover the security deposit.

418
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,739
I'm glad to, because...

419
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:17,626
Every dent in that place represents
a memory that I'll cherish forever.

420
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:18,960
But on one condition.

421
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:22,490
We all put aside ten bucks
every week for the next year,

422
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,766
And we come back here
and we buy that 50-year-old scotch,

423
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:29,653
And we toast the incredible
life-changing year we've all had.

424
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,343
Get out of our booth.

425
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,087
Me with my new family,

426
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:37,885
Marshall and Lily
in their new apartment,

427
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:38,947
and Robin

428
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:42,626
as the number one english-speaking
journalist in the Pacific rim,

429
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,185
visiting us here in New York
to celebrate this day.

430
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:49,558
The day we closed
an incredible chapter in our lives,

431
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,483
only to open up a new one.

432
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:55,646
- I think I left my cell...
- Get out of here.

433
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,649
<i>And one year later,
that's exactly what we did.</i>

434
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:04,211
And so let's raise a glass
of $2,500 scotch

435
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:05,798
to one hell of a year.

436
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:10,869
Amazing.

437
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,977
That's unbelievable.

438
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:15,761
It's kind of smoky,
with a hint of aged cedar and

439
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:17,286
do you guys taste the difference
twince vice and

440
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,797
- ten-dollar scotch?
- Not at all. No difference.

441
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,805
I want to cut mine with red bull.

442
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,823
Wendy, can you take a picture?

443
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,335
<i>A lot of things
did change that year,</i>

444
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:28,495
<i>but some things stayed the same.</i>

445
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:31,690
So... what do you say
we move this party upstairs

446
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,432
- to the apartement?
- Yeah. Great idea.

447
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,617
What the...?

448
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:48,729
Barney, this is an intervention.

449
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,913
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

450
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,617
All right, enough with
the "old man" bit.

451
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,824
What about the old sand pit?

452
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:58,683
Let it go.

453
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,073
"let it snow"?

454
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:02,528
I love that old ditty!

455
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,749
I'm getting my flail.

456
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,858
You're setting sail?
