1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:05,133
You will not believe what happened
at laser tag last night.

2
00:00:05,557 --> 00:00:06,806
People freaked out because

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,434
a creepy man in a suit
wouldn't leave their kids alone?

4
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:12,729
Well, yeah, pretty much.

5
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:19,344
Come on! You want it?!

6
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:22,852
My shoulder!

7
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:24,812
Come on.

8
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:28,411
Stinson, my office! Now!

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,680
Crap.

10
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:32,465
Disorderly game play,

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,793
three counts of shoving,
and now this!

12
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:37,079
Stinson, you're a liability!

13
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:40,649
I know, I don't play
by your precious rules, McCracken,

14
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,009
but, damn it, I get results!

15
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:46,082
Look, you're a good
laser tag player.

16
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:48,352
Maybe the best I've ever seen.

17
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:51,158
But one of these days,
you're gonna get someone hurt.

18
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:52,519
Maybe even yourself.

19
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:55,306
You just forgot
what it's like out there.

20
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:58,149
You've had your fat ass stuck
behind that desk for too long.

21
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,292
That's it!
You're out of here, Stinson!

22
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,087
Hand in your gun and your ID badge!

23
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:03,412
With pleasure.

24
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:10,370
Please don't do this.
This game is all I got.

25
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:14,207
And I've almost got enough tickets
for the remote control helicopter.

26
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:16,501
Please.

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,980
I can't believe I'm doing this.

28
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,348
But I'm gonna give
you one last shot.

29
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:26,219
But so help me,

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,941
if you so much as step one toe
out of line,

31
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:31,379
you'll play Duck Hunt
in your mama's basement so fast,

32
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:33,246
it's gonna make your head spin.

33
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:35,486
Now, get out of here!

34
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:40,458
You won't regret this.

35
00:01:47,547 --> 00:01:50,827
That's it, Stinson.
You're banned for life!

36
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:15,677
I can't believe you got kicked out
of laser tag. What are you gonna do?

37
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,577
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

38
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:20,724
I'll tell you
what Ted and I are gonna do.

39
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,284
We're gonna break in after hours
and TP the place.

40
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,955
Barney, we are too old
to cover a place in toilet paper

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,035
because they won't
let you play laser tag.

42
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,237
And for that matter,
too old for laser tag.

43
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:37,424
Ted, laser tag knows
no age restrictions.

44
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:39,492
Kind of like stripping
in the Midwest.

45
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:41,201
Yeah, whatever.

46
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:43,288
I'm adding laser tag
to the Murtaugh List.

47
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:46,717
- Jeez, not the Murtaugh List.
- What's the Murtaugh List?

48
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:48,974
<i>The Murtaugh List is something
that came into being</i>

49
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,658
<i>around the time I turned 30.</i>

50
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:53,089
<i>It all started with
yourUncle Marshall's beer bong.</i>

51
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,290
Two, one, chug!

52
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:56,909
<i>When we were in our early 20s,</i>

53
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,594
<i>every time we had a party,
that beer bong came out.</i>

54
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,419
<i>And around the time
we turned 30, same thing.</i>

55
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:05,602
<i>Of course, in our early 20s,
the next day would go like this.</i>

56
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:10,148
<i>But by the time we were 30,
the next day would go like this.</i>

57
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,065
<i>Then one day, in the throes of the worst
hangover of my life,</i>

58
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,449
<i>I realized there was only one person
in the world that I could relate to:</i>

59
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,939
<i>Detective Roger Murtaugh,
played by Danny Glover</i>

60
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:25,121
<i>in the'80s noir masterpiece</i>
Lethal Weapon<i>,</i>

61
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:27,974
<i>known for his
oft-quoted catchphrase:</i>

62
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:29,876
- I'm too old for this...
- Stuff.

63
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,455
<i>He said,
I'm too old for this stuff.</i>

64
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,633
It's sad to admit, but as you get older,
there's things you can't do anymore.

65
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,628
That's why I have this list, so
I never make the mistake of thinking

66
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,971
that I can still
pull an all-nighter.

67
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,832
I'm too old for that stuff.

68
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,644
Or eat an entire pizza
in one sitting.

69
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:50,269
I'm too old for that stuff.

70
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,942
Or hang posters
on your wall without frames.

71
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,110
"Riggs."

72
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,117
<i>I'm too old for that stuff.</i>

73
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:03,451
- By the way, how good is <i>Lethal Weapon?</i>
- I don't know. It's kind of a rip-off.

74
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:06,436
Old guy paired up
with a young renegade cop.

75
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:07,811
Sound familiar?

76
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,250
<i>Mackleroy and LaFleur.</i>

77
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:14,254
Don't tell me you guys have never seen
<i>Mackleroy and LaFleur.</i>

78
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:18,007
It's the greatest Canadian
action movie of all time.

79
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,313
Mackleroy is a young,
renegade Mountie

80
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:23,680
whose horse was just killed
by evil Americans,

81
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:27,267
while LaFleur, his grouchy,
old, African-Canadian partner,

82
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:30,228
just bought a cozy ice fishing
shack in northern Alberta...

83
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,401
- I got to go.
- Bye, baby. Have fun at practice.

84
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:37,445
Practice?

85
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,480
Is he doing that one-man
band thing again?

86
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:41,281
'Cause that was a bummer.

87
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:42,812
<i>Actually,</i>

88
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,501
<i>He had just taken over</i>

89
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:46,842
<i>as coach for Lily's
kindergarten basketball team.</i>

90
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:50,971
<i>He thought it'd be fun, but Lily saw it
as something more: Dad practice.</i>

91
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:52,096
Hi.

92
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:54,043
Hey! Oh, my gosh!

93
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,004
Orange slices. That is so sweet.

94
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,628
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't resist.

95
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:01,134
I wanted to see
Coach Marshmallow do his thing.

96
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:05,994
Hey, kids,
who wants to knock off early

97
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,558
and have some of these here
orange slices?

98
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,769
- Yeah!
- Yeah? Well, you can't!

99
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:15,212
Because oranges are for winners,
and you little turds

100
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:17,540
haven't even made a single shot yet!

101
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:20,841
You're embarrassing yourselves,
you're embarrassing Ms. Aldrin,

102
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,907
and worst of all,
you're embarrassing me!

103
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:25,203
That's it!

104
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:27,009
Suicides! Baseline! Now!

105
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:29,378
Run.

106
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:34,604
Ted, there is not
a single thing on here

107
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,315
that you are too old to do.

108
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,978
In fact, if you did
everything on the Murtaugh List,

109
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:40,757
I'd call that a pretty fun weekend.

110
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,750
Barney, you are not 18 anymore.

111
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,595
If you did everything
on that list, you would die.

112
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,947
- That wasn't a challenge.
- Challenge accepted.

113
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:52,406
In the next 24 hours,
I'm going to do

114
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:54,103
every single thing on this list.

115
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:55,704
And after I do,

116
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:58,942
you will TP
the laser tag place with me.

117
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:02,109
- And if you can't do it?
- I will spend three hours

118
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:05,031
listening to you
talk about architecture.

119
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,749
You have got yourself a deal.
Robin, will you do the honors?

120
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,153
A gentleman's agreement!

121
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:14,056
All right, chumps, let's do this.

122
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,998
You really want to make this bet
with him? You know how he is.

123
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:23,934
There is some pretty
tough stuff on that list.

124
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:26,928
I mean, do you really think
Barney's gonna get his ear pierced?

125
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,347
"Get ear pierced." Check.

126
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:32,725
All right, I'm off to go
do laundry at Mom's house.

127
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,745
You mind if I crash
on your futon tonight?

128
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,706
- We don't have a futon.
- Put it over there, boys.

129
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:46,283
- What's going on?
- It's on the Murtaugh List.

130
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:49,337
"Crash on a friend's futon
instead of getting a hotel room."

131
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:52,083
I am too old for that stuff.

132
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:54,050
What's going on with your ear?

133
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:56,553
Looks like the inside
of a jack-o'-lantern on November 3rd.

134
00:06:57,496 --> 00:06:59,945
What, this?
Ah, just a little infecsh.

135
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:02,323
Nothing a young guy like me
can't shake off.

136
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:04,978
Plus, "Put off going
to the doctor," on the list.

137
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,367
Hold on.

138
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,229
Go for Bar...

139
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:14,951
Keep running!

140
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,700
You know what's funny is, I was supposed
to come here to teach them...

141
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,161
Do not stop running!

142
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:24,789
This whole time, they've been
the ones who are teaching me.

143
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,587
That's not running!
That's falling!

144
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,101
<i>The next morning, Barney woke up
on the futon in our living room.</i>

145
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:42,972
Check.

146
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:46,468
"Drinking shots with strangers."

147
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:47,729
Check.

148
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,899
You OK, Barney?
It looks like you hurt your back.

149
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:53,566
Oh, no.
Just rocking a party hunch.

150
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:55,068
I like it.

151
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,947
Closer to my booze. To youth.

152
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,605
Can I get a straw?

153
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,906
I must say,
there's something admirable

154
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,880
about the way he wants
to stay young at heart.

155
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:16,883
- I mean, who wants to get old?
- This guy.

156
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:22,305
Life is a meal
and old age is the dessert.

157
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,085
I spend so much of my time
worrying about the future.

158
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,363
Where's my career going?
Who am I gonna marry?

159
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:29,516
But when you're old,
you don't worry,

160
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,648
'cause all that stuff's
already happened.

161
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:34,178
You get to wear comfy shoes
and a chair takes you up

162
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,818
and down the stairs, it's perfect.

163
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:38,112
That's not perfect.
That's pathetic.

164
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,574
You can't just jump to the end.
The journey is the best part.

165
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,492
I used to feel that way, too,

166
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:47,327
but you'll understand
when you're a little bit older.

167
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:51,596
Marshall, can you try
not to pick on the kids today.

168
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:53,662
I'm not picking on the kids, Lily.

169
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:56,255
I'm picking on the culture
of losing around here.

170
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,743
I got to get them in shape

171
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,560
if they're gonna win
that game tomorrow.

172
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:00,685
Win?

173
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,554
We don't keep score.

174
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:06,558
- What?
- We don't keep score.

175
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:08,523
You don't keep s...

176
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,867
What's the point of playing
if you don't keep score?

177
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:13,193
How do you know...

178
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:16,067
Lily, what were you doing
with this team before I got here?

179
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:17,569
I was coaching them.

180
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:21,022
That's it, my little angels.

181
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:24,085
You're all luminous
wonderful beings of light.

182
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,495
- What's the score?
- It's all tied up at fun to fun!

183
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:32,875
Because that's the point of playing,
to have fun.

184
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,705
The point of playing
is to win the trophy.

185
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,798
And if you don't know who's
winning, who gets the trophy?

186
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:39,966
Everyone.

187
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,845
It's a participation trophy,
everyone gets one.

188
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:47,432
It's like you're speaking
Chinese to me right now.

189
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,165
- Hi, this is Barney.
- And Robin.

190
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,190
- We can't answer the phone because...
- He's watching sports and I'm...

191
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,829
Probably out shopping.

192
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:59,010
Leave a message,
we'll call you back just as soon...

193
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,135
- As...
- We...

194
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:01,253
Can!

195
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:04,935
"Leave an annoying two-person message
on your answering machine."

196
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:06,055
Check.

197
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:09,829
Probably gonna cost me
some dates, but it's okay.

198
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,260
Your ear's starting to smell.

199
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:13,897
It's good.

200
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:16,586
I hate to send it back,

201
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:19,272
but you did describe the turkey
as extremely lean,

202
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:21,508
and, well, you tell me.

203
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:24,591
All right. That's it.

204
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,262
- We have our own list.
- What?

205
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:28,869
This is a list of things
you're too young to do.

206
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:32,644
Go out and do each one of these things,
tell me you still want to be an old man.

207
00:10:34,294 --> 00:10:36,588
Remove "colonoscopy"
and "Have sex with an old lady",

208
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,191
and this is a cakewalk.

209
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:41,344
New stakes, then.

210
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:43,930
If I can finish your list
before you finish mine,

211
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:45,925
you have to come with me
to TP laser tag

212
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,293
and you have to buy
the toilet paper.

213
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:51,676
And none of that biodegradable crap.
I want it up there forever.

214
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:54,102
Fine,
but if I finish your list first,

215
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,607
it's a six hour survey

216
00:10:55,732 --> 00:10:57,676
of early 20th century
American architecture

217
00:10:57,801 --> 00:11:00,484
and you can never do anything
on the Murtaugh List ever again.

218
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:03,216
- It's for your own good.
- You, sir, have got yourself a deal.

219
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,048
A gentleman's agreement!

220
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:13,799
Marshall, they're in kindergarten.
This isn't how you teach basketball.

221
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,728
Sure it is. It's the way I learned.

222
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:17,673
Are you kidding me?

223
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:20,498
What kind of sociopath
taught you this way?

224
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:25,530
Come on, Dad. I'm tired.

225
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:26,991
Sleep is for winners.

226
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:29,158
You can go to bed
when you score a basket.

227
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:30,159
I'm trying.

228
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:32,341
Let's give you
two points for trying.

229
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:35,456
But negative two points
for having a great big head.

230
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:39,502
My father gave me no quarter

231
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,130
and I asked for no quarter.

232
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:45,675
I totally got to call that guy.

233
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:48,461
Keep stretching!

234
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:55,268
"Put on reading glasses." Check.

235
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,075
"Yell at neighborhood kids."

236
00:11:58,433 --> 00:11:59,609
My pleasure.

237
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:06,747
- What the hell happened to you?
- I just had a very minor

238
00:12:06,872 --> 00:12:08,990
"blew out my knee
and it hurts like hell" incident.

239
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,200
- How did you blow out your knee?
- We...

240
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:15,079
"Helped someone move out of a 6th floor
walk-up in exchange for pizza and beer."

241
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,578
Or we helped someone
rob a sixth floor walk-up.

242
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,710
They were in a big hurry
and left all the pictures behind.

243
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,754
Whatevs, it counts.

244
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:26,904
Now, I am off to
"Dye my hair a funny color",

245
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:29,343
and then we are going to,
"Go to a rave".

246
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:31,846
4:00!

247
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:33,014
Supper time.

248
00:12:34,617 --> 00:12:36,147
So, your dad was tough on you.

249
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:38,896
That stinks,
but you don't have to be like him.

250
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:41,105
You can learn from his mistakes.

251
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:43,836
Mistakes? Lily, scoreboard.

252
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,234
The guy nailed it, okay?
He taught me how to be a winner.

253
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,614
That's what I'm teaching these kids.
And, for that matter,

254
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,866
that's what I'm gonna teach
our kids someday.

255
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,242
Okay, that's it.

256
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,587
This is not
how we're gonna raise our kids!

257
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:58,206
And this is not
how you're gonna coach this team!

258
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,422
At tomorrow's game,
if you are anything less

259
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,965
than a teddy bear stuffed
with cotton candy and rainbows,

260
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,277
I will silent treatment
your ass into the ground!

261
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:11,033
You'll think the time I found
your Internet search history

262
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,054
was a freakin' picnic!

263
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:14,430
Are we clear?

264
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,768
- There are many different philo...
- Are we clear?

265
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:19,967
Yes, ma'am.

266
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,608
What's ironic is that now...

267
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:34,965
Just call Ted.

268
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:36,586
I want to go home.

269
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:38,486
All right. I'm calling him.

270
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:40,998
But it's 4:30 in the morning.
He's not going to be awake.

271
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,476
Up at 4:00...

272
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:44,003
Check.

273
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:47,171
- Is he answering?
- I haven't dialed yet.

274
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,044
Please hurry, Robin.

275
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:52,319
Perfect.

276
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,733
"Take forever to answer the phone."

277
00:13:58,558 --> 00:13:59,683
Come on, Ted.

278
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:02,394
Someone gave me some aspirin
and I don't think it was aspirin.

279
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,450
Check.

280
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,760
So, I know that I have been
a little tough on you

281
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:16,447
for the past couple days.

282
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:19,184
And I apologize for that.

283
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:23,763
So today, we're not gonna
worry about winning.

284
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:25,709
We're gonna go out there and

285
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,115
have fun.

286
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:31,778
<i>Kids, over the years,
your uncle Marshall has told and retold</i>

287
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:34,885
<i>the story of this game
hundreds of times. And in reality,</i>

288
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:37,828
<i>the kids on that other team
were probably only a grade older.</i>

289
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,889
<i>But, in telling
and retelling the story,</i>

290
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:41,914
<i>they came to look like this.</i>

291
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:55,813
Way to let them score that easily.

292
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,825
Now, you're sitting down.
Awesome.

293
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,207
Addison, it's not soccer.

294
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:06,875
You don't kick the ball!

295
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,960
Unless that's something
that you think is fun,

296
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:13,559
in which case, great job having fun.

297
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:21,362
- That was a foul, wasn't it, Ref?
- My name's not Ref. It's Kenny.

298
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,781
- And watch your tone.
- No tone, Kenny.

299
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:24,906
Great job, Kenny.

300
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:26,675
Thanks a lot, Kenny.

301
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,350
See you later, Kenny.

302
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,986
All right, Barney. As your manager,
I am throwing in the towel.

303
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:34,445
This bet is over.
Your ear looks like

304
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:37,026
a free Danish
at a continental breakfast.

305
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,452
No. One thing left. "Beer bong."

306
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:44,111
Coming right up.

307
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:47,247
Oh, I

308
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:50,243
found these weird Russian beers
in the basement.

309
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:52,654
Russian beers?
I'll take a brewski.

310
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,417
Brewski. Get it?

311
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Yeah, it's...

312
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,971
It's a little warm.
Hope that's not a problem.

313
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:06,268
No, don't, don't.

314
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:10,689
All right, Ted.
You win. I hate this.

315
00:16:11,027 --> 00:16:12,649
I hate all of it.

316
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:14,418
My back is killing me.

317
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,528
Everyone at the rave
thought I was a narc.

318
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:20,162
My ear hurts so bad I can hear it...

319
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:23,454
I can hear my own ear.
Think about that.

320
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:26,992
My clothes... What is it...
What is it... What am I...

321
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:28,509
Get this stuff off of me!

322
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:31,168
Ted, I'll pay you double
for your finest suit.

323
00:16:31,376 --> 00:16:32,376
Here's

324
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,930
30 bucks.

325
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,548
And throw in the shoes.

326
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:38,509
You win, Ted.

327
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:41,459
I'll never do anything
on the Murtaugh List again.

328
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:43,853
I'm too old for this stuff.

329
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:47,380
You know, Barney, last night,
I went to bed at 8:00

330
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:50,629
because it was on the list,
and I couldn't sleep because

331
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:52,207
well, it was 8:00.

332
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,358
So I decided to watch <i>Lethal Weapon</i>.

333
00:16:57,569 --> 00:16:59,258
<i>And then,
when I still couldn't sleep,</i>

334
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:01,133
<i>I watched </i>Lethal Weapon 2.

335
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:03,443
<i>And then I watched 3.</i>

336
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:07,079
<i>And then, halfway through</i>
Lethal Weapon 4<i>,</i>

337
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,553
<i>is when it occurred to me...</i>

338
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:12,449
Murtaugh kept saying,
"I'm too old for this stuff",

339
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,012
but every time he'd say it,

340
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:16,304
he'd turn around,
make another movie,

341
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:17,840
and do more stuff.

342
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:20,982
I guess what I'm saying is

343
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:23,731
screw being old.

344
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:27,298
Let's go TP laser tag.

345
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,727
And then the hospital.

346
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:35,707
Great job, guys.

347
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:38,609
At least we're not keeping score, right?
No idea what the score is.

348
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,237
Could be 53 to zero.

349
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:43,143
Could be some other score.
It's 53 to zero.

350
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:45,450
What are we doing wrong, Coach?

351
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,404
You know what?
You're not doing anything wrong.

352
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,537
It's great that you guys are losing,

353
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:54,418
because in life, it doesn't matter
how much effort you put in,

354
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,087
or how hard you try,

355
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:58,349
people will just give you things.

356
00:17:58,474 --> 00:18:01,788
Like diplomas and jobs
and promotions.

357
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,821
So, it doesn't matter
what you do out there,

358
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:06,194
as long as...
as long as you have fun.

359
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:09,578
<i>At that point, because they didn't want
to fight in front of the kids,</i>

360
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:13,454
<i>your uncle Marshall and aunt Lily had
one of their telepathic conversations.</i>

361
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:16,868
<i>- Don't you give me that look.
- Lily, I can't take it anymore!</i>

362
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:18,567
<i>Your way of coaching is crazy!</i>

363
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:20,110
<i>Stop yelling at me!</i>

364
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:21,619
<i>Sorry.</i>

365
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,073
<i>But can I please do it my way?</i>

366
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,139
<i>Fine, but I'm going
to do it my way, too.</i>

367
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:29,620
<i>I'm getting my guitar.</i>

368
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,435
<i>I don't know if it was
Marshall's tough attitude,</i>

369
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,001
<i>Lily's gentle encouragement,</i>

370
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:38,185
<i>or some magical combination
of the two,</i>

371
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,873
<i>but in the second half of that game,</i>

372
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:42,299
<i>that ragtag group
of little firecrackers</i>

373
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,190
<i>got beat down even worse.</i>

374
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:50,641
<i>In fact, according
to your uncle Marshall,</i>

375
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:53,046
<i>in the second half,
the other team got even taller.</i>

376
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,689
<i>And one of them
turned into a Teen Wolf.</i>

377
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:58,878
Kenny! There is a Teen Wolf
on the court!

378
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:00,503
That can't be legal.

379
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:03,224
I know the Teen Wolf
looks different, kids,

380
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,013
but try to make sure
he feels included.

381
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,234
How is that not traveling, Kenny?

382
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:31,047
You are killing me!
You are absolutely killing me!

383
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:33,266
Watch it, Coach,
or you'll get a technical.

384
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:37,661
I am begging you
to give me a technical.

385
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:41,066
<i>When the final horn mercifully blew,</i>

386
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:44,382
<i>the score was,
by Marshall's estimate, 118 to nothing.</i>

387
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,972
<i>And even though
they didn't win anything,</i>

388
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:50,534
<i>everyone, even the coach,
got a participation trophy.</i>

389
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:52,661
I understand if you don't want it.

390
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:55,448
I love it.

391
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:00,711
I worked so hard. It feels good
to be appreciated for my effort.

392
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:02,629
I know, baby.

393
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,678
Maybe your way
is not totally stupid.

394
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,169
Thanks.

395
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,767
Your way is totally stupid.

396
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:26,925
Son

397
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:31,271
you have been a pain in my ass
ever since you joined this club.

398
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:34,671
But damn it

399
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:38,136
if this ain't some
of the finest TP work I've ever seen.

400
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,360
You're reinstated

401
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,158
effective immediately.

402
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,367
Really?

403
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,164
Hell, no!

404
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,794
I'm calling the police!

405
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:55,783
Grown-ass man with pink hair throwing
toilet paper. You're kidding me.

406
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,580
- I'm too old for this...
- <i>Stuff.</i>

407
00:20:58,063 --> 00:20:59,255
<i>He said stuff.</i>
