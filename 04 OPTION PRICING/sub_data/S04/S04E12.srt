1
00:00:01,544 --> 00:00:02,664
<i>Kids, in the winter of 2009,</i>

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,088
<i>aunt Robin and I
had just become roommates.</i>

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,690
<i>And to be honest,
it wasn't going very smoothly.</i>

4
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,756
That looks good.
I'm gonna get some.

5
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:12,216
- There's no more milk.
- No, I just saw some in the fridge.

6
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:12,984
Empty.

7
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:14,279
So throw it out.

8
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:15,608
The trash can's full.

9
00:00:15,778 --> 00:00:17,311
So take the trash out.

10
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:19,179
I'm eating cereal.

11
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:23,240
You know, when I asked you
to be my roommate, I figured,

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,592
"She's a girl, she'll be neat."

13
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,295
But no, you're Ogre
from Revenge of the Nerds.

14
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:30,666
You know what, Ted?

15
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:34,334
Instead of coming up with hot off
the press topical references like that,

16
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,105
maybe you should spend a little time,
I don't know,

17
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:39,108
washing a dish ever.

18
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:41,499
Darn, I can't.

19
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,421
I'm too busy leaving a plate of cookies

20
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:46,353
for the magical elf
who changes the toilet paper roll.

21
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:48,477
Wait, there's no elf.

22
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,852
- It's always me!
- I always change it.

23
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:52,657
- You never do it!
- That is ridiculous!

24
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:55,489
- No, I went in there yesterday...
- I changed it the last five times.

25
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,718
God, what is going on?

26
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,855
When we were dating each other,
we were practically living together

27
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:02,721
and we didn't drive
each other this crazy.

28
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,903
I know.

29
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,144
What happened?

30
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:07,158
You know what it is?

31
00:01:07,422 --> 00:01:08,779
We were having sex.

32
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,224
Men and women need sex
to live together.

33
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:13,316
It solves all disputes.

34
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,999
Like Barney's theory
about world peace?

35
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,868
So I explained to her.
I said, Madeline,

36
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,157
every single international conflict

37
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:24,113
essentially boils down
to sexual tension.

38
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,641
- Every international conflict?
- Every single one, dude.

39
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,715
So the crisis in the Middle East
could be solved by...

40
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:33,227
Gaza Strippers. Next.

41
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:35,926
- Apartheid?
- Apart thighs.

42
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,765
- What else you got?
- Cold War?

43
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:43,172
"Mrs. Gorbachev,
take down those pants."

44
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:49,138
Guess we should just start
having sex, then.

45
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:50,479
Yeah, right.

46
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,579
I know.

47
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:57,027
It's like riding a bike, buddy?

48
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,186
Riding a bike upside down, maybe.

49
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:02,704
Okay, listen.
If this is gonna happen on occasion,

50
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,521
we can't tell anyone about this.

51
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,764
- Deal?
- Deal.

52
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:06,864
Deal.

53
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,531
What the hell are you guys doing?

54
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:28,572
What, are you guys, like,
back together?

55
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:31,413
We're just having sex
so we don't fight anymore.

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,413
That's a great idea. No, really.

57
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:35,747
Two thumbs up, guys.

58
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:37,396
I just looked into the future

59
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:40,387
and that works out
really great for everyone.

60
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:42,296
What are you even doing here?

61
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:46,521
I was on my way to work and
I just had to drop by here to

62
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:48,689
read this magazine.

63
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:52,203
In... that room over there.

64
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,289
I get it. No problem, buddy.

65
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:57,157
Yes, a problem, buddy.

66
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:00,439
You came all the way over here
to read a magazine?

67
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,795
I'm willing to bet that
there is a place to

68
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,843
read a magazine at work.

69
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:07,662
You know, a room
with a little man on the door?

70
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:12,498
Come on. Nobody likes to read
a magazine at work.

71
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,048
I mean, you walk out of your office
holding a magazine

72
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:19,773
<i>and that magazine is saying
one thing and one thing only.</i>

73
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:23,065
Hey everyone, look at what
Marshall's about to do!

74
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:26,854
Marshall's about to read a big
ol' magazine in the bathroom

75
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,831
that you all share with him.

76
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:32,753
Well, have you thought about maybe

77
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:35,528
not reading a magazine
when you read a magazine?

78
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:38,011
You gotta read a magazine.
I mean,

79
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,658
that's why there's magazines.

80
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:41,735
Otherwise, it's just time
you're not getting back.

81
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:42,898
Exactly.

82
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:44,573
And the worst part is this:

83
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,959
That stretch of hallway from my door
to that restroom

84
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,129
is a

85
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:50,604
gauntlet of

86
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,155
judging eyes.

87
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,890
<i>You got my boss.</i>

88
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:57,031
<i>We all know exactly
what you're about to do.</i>

89
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,682
<i>Her boss.</i>

90
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:03,537
<i>Why don't you just move
your desk in there?</i>

91
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:06,179
<i>I can't believe he has a wife Donald.</i>

92
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:08,675
<i>Sweetie, so obvious.</i>

93
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:13,760
Anyways, I just would
rather do that here.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,254
No, I'm sorry.
This is our apartment now.

95
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,132
You have to read a magazine
some place else.

96
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:22,980
- Give me your key.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

97
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:27,692
I seem to recall a deal
being struck between three parties

98
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:30,180
where in none would discuss
a certain

99
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,197
event that transpired.

100
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,622
An event of the

101
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:37,328
persuasion. That key, madam,

102
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:38,800
buys my silence.

103
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,066
Good day to you both.

104
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,499
You two hooked up?

105
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,018
Thanks a lot, Lily.

106
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:49,529
So,

107
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:50,984
you two

108
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:52,451
slept together.

109
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:53,761
That is awf

110
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:55,456
some.

111
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:56,897
Awfsome.

112
00:04:57,638 --> 00:04:59,375
Nice work, Ted. Tap that.

113
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,115
It sounds like
a bigger deal than it is.

114
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,518
We talked it over and
we both realized

115
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,127
we've had a rough couple of months.

116
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:07,501
We deserve a little fun.

117
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,838
This could wind up
ruing your friendship.

118
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,522
When two exes try to
"just be casual,"

119
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:15,794
someone always winds up
getting hurt.

120
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:17,601
<i>Turned out, Lily was right.</i>

121
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:18,964
<i>But more on that later.</i>

122
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:21,346
Look, guys,
we've got this covered, okay?

123
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:24,133
No one's gonna get hurt.
We set up ground rules.

124
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,731
Rule number one, this is strictly
a physical relationship.

125
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,438
There are no feelings involved, okay?

126
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:32,158
Please, that's like telling
the Fonz to be cool.

127
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:35,304
And since it's just physical, we don't
have to worry about romance, right?

128
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:37,783
Hell, no.
We can do it while we watch TV!

129
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:38,616
Totally!

130
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:40,191
And we can multi-task. You know,

131
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,766
use the sex to spice up
otherwise dull activities.

132
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,154
Like folding laundry.

133
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:46,142
- Paying bills.
- Cooking dinner.

134
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:49,190
- That doesn't seem hygienic.
- Yeah, not that one.

135
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:52,410
And now that we're hooking up,
we're not fighting anymore.

136
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,223
Problem solved.
Actually, the credit belongs to Barney.

137
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:57,874
This whole idea came out of
your thing about world peace.

138
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,696
You were right.
Peace was achieved.

139
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:03,102
Repeatedly.

140
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,098
So I'm... responsible for...

141
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,439
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.

142
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,126
Next round's on me!

143
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:22,526
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Why do you ask?

144
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:25,491
Well, for one thing,
you're openly weeping.

145
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:27,519
With joy.

146
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,401
So happy for those two.

147
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,510
Barney, admit it.

148
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,366
You still have feelings for Robin
and this is killing you.

149
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,334
I am totally fine.

150
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:41,015
Now, excuse me for just a minute.

151
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:55,032
I'm totally fine.

152
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,468
You have to learn
how to express these feelings.

153
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:01,111
Maybe you should talk
to a psychiatrist.

154
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:02,281
Please.

155
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:04,555
If I'm gonna pay some woman
$200 an hour

156
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:07,757
to make me feel better,
we aren't going to be talking.

157
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,008
And we're both going to be
on that couch.

158
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:15,112
The woman in this
scenario is a prostitute.

159
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,738
A dirty, skanky, surgically enhanced,
Eastern European...

160
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:21,838
I got it.

161
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,308
And there's something kind of liberating
about not taking it all too seriously.

162
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:27,188
Last night, we actually did it

163
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:29,307
while I was returning
a bunch of phone calls.

164
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:32,155
I knew you didn't get
a rowing machine!

165
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,484
Awesome,
we're still talking about this!

166
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:41,139
Look, guys, this is a private thing
between me and Ted.

167
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:42,435
Private Thing.

168
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:45,843
We wouldn't even be talking
about this if Marshall

169
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:48,011
could read a magazine at work.

170
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,056
He's always been this way.
Remember law school?

171
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:53,226
Sure do.

172
00:07:58,435 --> 00:07:59,677
Baby, what is it?

173
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:02,485
The credit card bill came today.

174
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:04,509
You checked into a hotel

175
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,872
two blocks from school
on a Tuesday.

176
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:09,200
It's not what you think.

177
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,845
Who is she, Marshall?
What's her name?

178
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,333
Burrito.

179
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,762
Carnitas Burrito.

180
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:19,765
So, you checked into a hotel room

181
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:22,624
just so you could read
a magazine there?

182
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:25,101
Hey, Robin, do you want me
to see if the waitress has any

183
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,198
giant sugar cubes
for that high horse of yours?

184
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:31,399
Nobody likes to read a magazine
at work and if they say that they do,

185
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:32,662
then they're not human.

186
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,523
Dude, I read a magazine
at work every day.

187
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:38,134
I can't tell you how many meetings
I've been late to

188
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:40,365
because I was busy
"reading a magazine."

189
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:43,263
But I don't feel bad about it.
That's my time.

190
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:46,508
Sure, "reading a magazine"
ain't pretty,

191
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:48,704
but, you know,
it's something I gotta do.

192
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:50,830
So why be ashamed about it?

193
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:55,873
Wait, "reading a magazine"
means masturbating, right?

194
00:08:58,312 --> 00:08:59,657
I can't believe it.

195
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:01,672
You drank all my milk again!

196
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:04,486
- We can have sex.
- Okay.

197
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,186
It's the perfect set up.

198
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:10,144
Anytime we start getting
into an argument,

199
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:11,755
we just have sex instead.

200
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:15,112
One minute we're just laying into
each other, and then the next minute...

201
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:16,550
Well, same thing.

202
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,730
Awesome.

203
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,473
So, this morning, she's yelling
at me through the door,

204
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:26,581
"You're taking too long in the shower!"

205
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:29,111
Next thing I know, she hops in.

206
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:32,522
Now baby? Don't mind
I took my time.

207
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,319
So awesome.

208
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:39,930
Sorry I'm late.

209
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,030
I was just jammin' on Scherbatsky.

210
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,938
She used up all my stamps,
so long story short,

211
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:46,777
the postman rang twice.

212
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,685
You must bump this!

213
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,056
That's

214
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:52,579
just

215
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:54,173
so...

216
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:56,841
Excuse me for a second.

217
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,703
So, you're saying plasmas
are better for low light,

218
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:12,799
but LCDs are better for games?

219
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:16,807
Right, but the CRTs
have the truest blacks.

220
00:10:17,628 --> 00:10:20,170
So, if I want a really
crisp contrast ratio...

221
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,073
The CRT's deep-pixel cell structure

222
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:25,565
produces a resolution
you just can't match with an LCD.

223
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,897
I'll take the CRT.

224
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:33,678
Barney, this is nuts.

225
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:35,490
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

226
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,220
No, you're not.

227
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,797
You need to learn to let this stuff out.

228
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,101
Like we do in my kindergarten class.

229
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,305
"Feelings Hour" every Tuesday morning.

230
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,935
Look, Lily, maybe your
kindergartners are upset that

231
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:49,654
their friends are sleeping with
each other, but not me.

232
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,289
I have never been better.

233
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,211
<i>Meanwhile, Marshall was still
struggling at work.</i>

234
00:10:56,118 --> 00:10:57,298
Coming through.

235
00:10:57,468 --> 00:10:58,876
Big breakfast this morning.

236
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,713
You know what that means.

237
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,843
<i>But then came the best news
he'd heard in a long time.</i>

238
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:06,050
And did you hear?

239
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,224
They laid off
everybody on the eighth floor.

240
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:10,861
I know. It's a ghost town down there.

241
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:37,557
- Morning.
- Morning.

242
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,311
Hey, that was fun last night.

243
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,409
Word, that was a good one.

244
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,483
Mental note: Don't throw out
the pizza box more often.

245
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:47,377
All right, see you later.

246
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:04,207
So, last night, Robin left a pizza box
out on the floor,

247
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,997
- so we had sex three times.
- Sure.

248
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,497
And then, this morning
before I left for work

249
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,551
- we kissed.
- That's weird.

250
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,683
That is weird.

251
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:13,541
Right?

252
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:16,743
That kiss violated the spirit
of our whole arrangement. I mean,

253
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:18,836
she probably thinks
I'm getting feelings for her.

254
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:20,250
Well, are you?

255
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,081
Yes, I'm in love with her.

256
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,820
Is what you... That's you, dude.

257
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:28,826
No. It didn't mean anything.

258
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:31,917
It was just some leftover reflex
from when we were a couple.

259
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,740
But I think I probably blew it.

260
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:35,396
Definitely.

261
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:38,646
It is so over.

262
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,723
Hold the phone. Maybe Robin
didn't think it was weird.

263
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:45,559
It was weird. Weird...

264
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,286
W-I-E-R-D. Weird.

265
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:49,870
That's not how you spell "weird."

266
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,926
Come on, Lily.
Nobody likes a Ted.

267
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:53,754
I tried to warn you.

268
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:57,096
When exes relapse,
someone always gets hurt.

269
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:58,655
But no one listened.

270
00:12:58,825 --> 00:12:59,932
Story of my life.

271
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:03,010
My cuteness interferes with people
hearing my message.

272
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,362
Well, what should I do?

273
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:06,155
There's only one thing to do.

274
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:09,256
You have to stop sleeping together,
please.

275
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:12,191
I think we have to stop
sleeping together.

276
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:15,121
With me and Ted,
it's like cigarettes.

277
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:17,461
You have one when you're drunk
and you think it's fine.

278
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,706
But before you know it,
you're buying a carton a week.

279
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:21,989
I think I have to end it.

280
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,214
I have to end it.

281
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:25,691
So...

282
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:27,508
We're ending it...?

283
00:13:27,678 --> 00:13:29,125
I think so, yeah.

284
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:30,704
It's probably for the best.

285
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:32,255
It was fun, but

286
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:34,429
- I don't want things to get weird.
- Me neither.

287
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,655
- Roomies?
- Roomies.

288
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:42,808
But we tell no one.

289
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:43,978
Deal?

290
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:45,169
- Deal.
- Deal.

291
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:47,193
- Dude!
- Come on!

292
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:49,316
What is the matter with you?

293
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,266
That one.

294
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:57,231
So, that didn't last long.

295
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:01,093
By the way, Marshall, what were
you doing back in our apartment?

296
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,570
I thought you had
the perfect situation.

297
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,079
I did.

298
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,997
Everything was going great.

299
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:10,362
I was feeling more comfortable,
more confident.

300
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:12,632
I felt I could take on the world.

301
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:17,109
One morning, I took my magazine
down to the eighth floor.

302
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,320
We gotta gut this whole place.

303
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,367
I need these walls taken out

304
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,799
here

305
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:28,107
and here.

306
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,277
You got it.

307
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,887
Celebrities pick up their dry cleaning?

308
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:36,765
I pick up my dry cleaning.

309
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:39,236
Don't come in!

310
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:41,459
So that didn't last long.

311
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,366
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?

312
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,304
Well, since all these

313
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,436
roomie squabbles
are still causing friction

314
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,490
between you and Robin,
I thought I'd help out.

315
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:54,814
BTW, I went by the post office today.

316
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:56,286
I picked you up some stamps.

317
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:58,207
Here's ten thousand.
That oughta do.

318
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,279
Thanks, I guess.

319
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:03,093
You want a beer?

320
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:08,974
Yeah, I picked those up on the way over.
It was nothing.

321
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,100
Did you buy us a dishwasher?

322
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:16,975
That dishwasher's always been there.
How long have you lived here?

323
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:26,266
So, you're doing all this to keep
me and Robin from fighting, huh?

324
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:27,752
Exactly.

325
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:29,766
I worry about you two.

326
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:34,737
It bothers you that Robin and I
are hooking up, doesn't it?

327
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,391
Not at all. That's crazy.

328
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:41,588
What?

329
00:15:44,286 --> 00:15:45,983
Are you in love with Robin?

330
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,631
You're in love with Robin.

331
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:56,456
That's why you don't want us
hooking up.

332
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,927
What? That is crazy talk.

333
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:03,497
Can't a bro clean another bro's
apartment like bros do?

334
00:16:03,956 --> 00:16:07,142
Name me one bro in the history of bros
who has ever done that.

335
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,549
I'll name two,

336
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:14,642
Misters Clean and Belvedere.

337
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:18,928
Look, this thing with me and Robin,
it's totally casual.

338
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:21,548
I'm not gonna freak out if you tell me
you have feelings for her.

339
00:16:21,572 --> 00:16:22,667
So, do you?

340
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:26,281
No. No, I don't. I don't, no.
I don't. I don't. No.

341
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:28,903
Robin is all yours, dude.
Have fun with her.

342
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:34,351
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go sleep with other girls.

343
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,266
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

344
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,503
Positive?

345
00:16:37,926 --> 00:16:39,119
Absolutely.

346
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:43,412
<i>And then I stormed out.</i>

347
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:45,393
Why did I do that?

348
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:49,291
I mean, maybe it goes back
to my father issues, but...

349
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:52,035
I basically gave my best friend license

350
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,703
to have sex with the girl of my dreams.

351
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:56,976
I totally sabotaged myself.

352
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:00,209
And now I'm smoking.

353
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:01,700
Now I'm smoking.

354
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,668
Get out.

355
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,970
But it's feelings hour
and I'm holding Feely the Share Bear.

356
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,853
And whoever's holding
Feely the Share Bear

357
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:12,402
gets to sit in the share chair.

358
00:17:12,544 --> 00:17:16,143
Barney, this is not your private
therapist's office.

359
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:19,269
These kids have issues
to talk about, too, you know.

360
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,448
Ben's parents are getting divorced.

361
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:22,618
They are?

362
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,494
Who wants to do some coloring?

363
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:32,855
Great, did Lily send you?
I don't have the bear, okay?

364
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,896
I'm not giving it back!

365
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:37,884
Why are you smiling?

366
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:40,511
I just

367
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,052
read a magazine.

368
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:43,738
Here at work.

369
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:45,273
What?

370
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:46,820
Yeah. It's the funniest thing.

371
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,334
I was online,
looking up rates for hotels

372
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,549
<i>when I realized something.</i>

373
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,885
This is stupid.

374
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:57,127
I decided it was time to let go
of my hang-ups and

375
00:17:57,297 --> 00:18:00,241
do the thing I gotta do
and once I made that decision,

376
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:01,906
everything changed.

377
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:08,327
<i>There's a young man
who's comfortable with who he is.</i>

378
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,186
<i>I know what you're about to do
and I respect you for it.</i>

379
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:20,339
<i>Hey, Eriksen. Go the distance.</i>

380
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:32,041
You made a brave step today.

381
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:33,871
Remember what Shakespeare wrote,

382
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,869
"Virtue is bold,
and goodness never fearful."

383
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:39,465
You're right,

384
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:42,299
Super hot lady who my wife
keeps telling me why you're famous

385
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:43,732
but I keep forgetting.

386
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:45,272
Let's do this.

387
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:46,915
Lead the way.

388
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:53,428
Congratulations.

389
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:54,658
Thanks.

390
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,613
I was gonna have to do it eventually.
You know, sometimes you just gotta

391
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,399
you gotta man up and,

392
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:00,793
and just go for it.

393
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:04,970
I have to go.

394
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:09,302
By the way, I have a bathroom here
if you ever want to use it.

395
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,195
Son of a...

396
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:17,721
I have to tell you the truth.

397
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:20,399
I'm in love with... tacos.

398
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:22,818
What are you doing?

399
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:24,622
I'm taking out the triz-ash.

400
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,517
If you're... looking for Ted, he left.

401
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,230
And

402
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:33,219
our little arrangement is... over,

403
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,801
- by the way.
- Really? That's awes... ful.

404
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:39,831
- Awfsful?
- Yeah, it's just awfsful.

405
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:41,888
What happened?

406
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,263
He just insisted.

407
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,869
He said he couldn't do it anymore
because "someone's gonna get hurt."

408
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,273
I think we all know
who he meant by that.

409
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,159
Do we?

410
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,044
Isn't it obvious?

411
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,994
Is it?

412
00:19:57,554 --> 00:19:58,584
It's Ted.

413
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:00,791
You know what a romantic he is.

414
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:03,157
He can't separate the physical
from the emotional.

415
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:04,797
- He's all like...
- I love you.

416
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:05,967
Exactly.

417
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:08,501
He's not like you, you know?

418
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,795
Besides, we're friends.

419
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,603
I don't want to screw that up
by getting involved.

420
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,251
Dating friends never works out.

421
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:20,291
So... you want to get a taco?

422
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,750
A taco?

423
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,719
You love them, rember?

424
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:26,622
Right.

425
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,089
Come on, I'm hungry.

426
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,988
<i>So Robin and I went back
to just being roommates</i>

427
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,704
<i>and things went back to normal.</i>

428
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,728
<i>Your Aunt Lily was right.</i>

429
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:48,143
<i>When two exes decide to just be casual,</i>

430
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,775
<i>someone always gets hurt.</i>

431
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:54,264
<i>It just wasn't one of us.</i>
