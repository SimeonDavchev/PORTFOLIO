1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,460
In the spring of 2009.

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:03,919
I've been hired to design

3
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:06,522
a new headquarters for
Goliath National Bank.

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,605
And I was eager to add as much of my voices

5
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:10,668
as an architect into the plan as possible.

6
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:15,227
Woodbeams bathed in
natural light in the atrium.

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,343
They're gonna love it!

8
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:19,947
There was only one problem

9
00:00:20,327 --> 00:00:22,313
and his name was Bilson

10
00:00:22,337 --> 00:00:24,593
wood natural light.

11
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:26,573
Ah, no!

12
00:00:26,597 --> 00:00:30,173
Natural light reminds the workers
that there's an outside world

13
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,353
where they had family and friends.

14
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,163
We want to crash that!

15
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:37,287
You show up in the dark,
you go home in the dark.

16
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:41,257
You spend your whole damn day in the dark!

17
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:43,943
I need to hear Lily's voice.

18
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:45,287
Who said you could leave.

19
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:49,543
Bilson was killing
every original idea I had.

20
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:50,324
Then, one day.

21
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:52,133
GNB took him off the project

22
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:55,283
and created a new task
force to oversee my designs

23
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:57,047
suddenly, everything changed.

24
00:00:57,197 --> 00:00:58,224
We'll have a roof top
in the end of the garden

25
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:00,123
for quiet contemplation.

26
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:01,634
We'll have a reflecting pool in the lobby

27
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:05,253
where local children
can come to make wishes.

28
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:06,433
The New GNB,

29
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,863
A place of work

30
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:11,753
that you can call "home".

31
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:16,607
Thank you, and welcome home.

32
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:23,627
Everything was going great,

33
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:25,867
until one day, in the elevator

34
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:33,867
yeah, it's ted

35
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:35,512
no, no, no, no, no, no

36
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,774
I did not approve that change

37
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:39,553
for the blueprints for the
new GNB headquarters

38
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:40,897
which I'm the head architect,

39
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:42,697
at only 30 years old

40
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:46,463
yes, I'm single, I'm not gifted charity.

41
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:48,097
What is that has to do with anything.

42
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:51,267
Alright, goodbye, Mr. Mayor.

43
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:54,873
You know that was a
fake phone call, don't you.

44
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,063
Yes, and I also know

45
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:00,487
that the new GNB headquarters
project was scrapped last month.

46
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:02,387
Nice try.

47
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,983
Check out Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars.

48
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,306
If I could nail any celebrity

49
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,000
it would definitely be Scarlett Johansson.

50
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:24,823
Hot, talented,

51
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,893
and nobody does that many
in Woody Allen's movies

52
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,493
without serious daddy's issues.

53
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:31,003
If I could nail any
celebrities, it would be Lily.

54
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,897
She's the star of my heart.

55
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,667
For me, it would be Hugh Jackman.

56
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:38,763
You know, I don't know, celebrities,

57
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:42,143
they're into some really
weird sex stuff. Trust me.

58
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,467
How would you know that.

59
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:47,383
This is embarassing, but I...

60
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:49,707
I went home with a celebrity one night.

61
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:52,303
Oh my god! Seriously.

62
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:55,383
Yeah, he wanted to do this
really freaky things with me,

63
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:56,973
So I left. That's it.

64
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:58,034
End of the story.

65
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:00,173
No, no, not end of the story

66
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:04,163
I need to know who,
when, and in where. Spoil it!

67
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:05,142
Lily, be calm, please settle down.

68
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,567
You're swallowing to much air.

69
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:08,463
But before you go any further,

70
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:11,647
I'm flattered, but
technically, I'm not a celebrity.

71
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:15,963
Plus, for the last time, I
put the mask on as a joke.

72
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,473
OK, not you Barney.

73
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,057
OK, who is it.

74
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:22,813
OK, now you give Lily the hiccups.

75
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:25,033
Ok, I won't tell you anything specific.

76
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:26,943
But all I'll say

77
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,402
is that he is Canadian born,

78
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:29,573
but you definitely know this guy.

79
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:31,543
And he got me back to his place

80
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,433
by offering to show me
a very unique collection.

81
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:35,742
What do you mean collection.

82
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,324
Well, you know some people collects

83
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:39,322
like stamps or coins, it's like that.

84
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:40,094
But I'm not telling.

85
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:43,233
Well, at least tell us the
weird thing he wanted to do.

86
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,782
I don't know what
you call it in the States,

87
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,334
but we have a name for it in Canada.

88
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,587
Look, I've already said too much.

89
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:52,443
So, mystery celebrity
who collects a mystery item

90
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:56,353
asked you to do a mystery Canadian sex act.

91
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:57,104
Yes.

92
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:58,347
Tell us.

93
00:03:58,717 --> 00:04:00,037
OK, I'll tell you.

94
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:04,313
But only if you guess
all three parts correctly.

95
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:06,993
- Well, that's just impossible.
- Exactly.

96
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:09,483
I don't even know any Canadian sex acts.

97
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:10,864
Well, you got your Sloppy Dog Sled,

98
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:13,963
your Newfoundland Lobster
Trap, your Full Mountie.

99
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,094
How do you know all these.

100
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:18,093
Canadiansexacts.org, it's
bookmarked on the top right.

101
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:19,803
Dot org - Yeah.

102
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:20,692
It's not for profit.

103
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:23,094
They really wanna just get
the information out there.

104
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:26,863
Hey, so I just had the
weirdest conversation.

105
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:28,344
This woman at GNB told me

106
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,842
that the new bank building
was scrapped last month.

107
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,027
It's crazy, right.

108
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:34,787
Wait, what's that look.

109
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:36,023
- Should we tell him.
- I don't wanna tell him.

110
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:37,322
- I think we should tell him.
- We're not telling him.

111
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:38,064
There was no look.

112
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:39,827
Guys, what the hell.

113
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,563
Ok, it's time that you know the truth.

114
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:45,943
A few weeks ago, Bilson
called us into his office.

115
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:49,063
We're scrapping the plan for
the new GNB headquarters.

116
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,633
This recession is killing us.

117
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:53,597
We're cutting anything non-essential.

118
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:55,964
And I have a lot of tough choices to make

119
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,987
to buy courtly retreat in Saint Croix.

120
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:01,723
Man, Ted is gonna be devastated.

121
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:03,983
Not when he hears it
coming from his best friend.

122
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:05,687
- I have to tell him!
- I have to tell him!

123
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,112
You should tell him,
you're his best friend.

124
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:09,402
I'm not, you're his best friend.

125
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:10,604
I'm not, you're his best friend.

126
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:12,413
Quiet, here he comes.

127
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,453
The white dude or the Asian fellow.

128
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:15,917
See I bearly know the guy.

129
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:18,887
- Hey, Ted, what's up.
- Hey, how're you doing

130
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:20,394
I'm frustrated.

131
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:22,553
Anything innovative I put on my designs.

132
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:24,853
Bilson just hacks out with a shitty

133
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:26,987
I hate to answer to a guy like that.

134
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,422
You should drop the project.

135
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,032
You should totally drop the project.

136
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:30,924
It's beneath you.

137
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:34,023
Then it's settled. To Ted
Mosby's new chapter...

138
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:37,563
Are you kidding They just lay off
another architect at my firm.

139
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,903
I mean Bilson is a pain sure.

140
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:42,307
But without this project,
I'm probably out of the job.

141
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,833
Right, it's funny that
you metioned the project.

142
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:47,312
- Because...
- You're nailing it.

143
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:48,707
Keep up the good work buddy.

144
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:51,047
Your hair and teeth look fantastic today.

145
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,347
You're shining like a diamond!

146
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,117
Thank you.

147
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,917
I needed that.

148
00:05:57,947 --> 00:05:59,993
All right, I'm going to head
upstairs and keep working.

149
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:01,787
I got to find a way to introduce some wood

150
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:03,087
into Bilson's dark atrium.

151
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,287
I think you know what I meant.

152
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:10,547
What was that - What

153
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:11,947
I have a thought.

154
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:13,787
Okay, we're paying Ted's firm

155
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:15,593
for two more months of
design work no matter what,

156
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:16,887
so couldn't we just let him

157
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,047
keep working and not tell him.

158
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,587
He's had a rough year.

159
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:22,423
Let's let the guy be
happy a little while longer.

160
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:25,117
Marshall, what you're suggesting

161
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:27,517
is an elaborate, long-term lie

162
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,217
that requires tremendous commitment.

163
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,417
A nice guy like you can't pull that off.

164
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,417
Sure I can.

165
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:34,747
Lie to me right now.

166
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:36,387
Okay.

167
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,587
I have a spaceship.

168
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:39,023
What kind of fuel powers your spaceship.

169
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:40,123
Okay, I don't have a spaceship.

170
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:41,747
No!

171
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,087
Stand your ground!

172
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,647
If someone questions you,

173
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:47,287
distract them from the
original lie with more lies.

174
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:48,287
Here, let me demonstrate.

175
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:49,417
I own a pony.

176
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:51,147
Ask me a question.

177
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:52,917
Okay.

178
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:56,017
Um, what color is your pony.

179
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,193
Well, when I first got Dandelion,

180
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,187
she was a deep, chestnut brown,

181
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:02,317
but, sadly, her stable is
located near a chemical plant,

182
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:04,017
which contaminated the drinking water.

183
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:07,487
So over time, she's turned
a sickly, grayish-white color

184
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:10,617
and there's nothing that
the vet can do to fix her.

185
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,117
My God!

186
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:13,887
I'm... That's horrible.

187
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,117
Is Dandelion going to be okay.

188
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:17,487
Okay.

189
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:18,487
All right. Huh.

190
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:19,817
You are good!

191
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:22,447
Dandelion's not even sick, is she.

192
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:26,217
So the building's really dead

193
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,787
and you guys lied to me.

194
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:30,847
We, we just did it to protect you, Ted.

195
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,687
I can't believe this.
I just got screwed by my two best friends

196
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:35,087
and I didn't even know it.

197
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,147
In Canada, that's called
a "Sneaky Snowplow."

198
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:49,088
That building was my dream
job, and now, it's just gone.

199
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,833
We're so sorry, Ted.

200
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:52,573
Yeah, I need a drink.

201
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:54,333
Poor Ted.

202
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,001
Would I seem heartless

203
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:58,318
if I switched us back to Canadian Sex Acts.

204
00:07:58,342 --> 00:07:59,849
- Not at all.
- I'm surprised you waited this long.

205
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:02,733
What the hell is a "Two-Hand Zamboni".

206
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,273
Let's just say, the only thing

207
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:07,473
the woman is wearing
is skates on her hands.

208
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:10,503
A "Manitoba Milk Bag".

209
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,133
Okay, it's like a "Chicago Mustache,"

210
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:13,533
but the person on the bottom

211
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:14,803
is wearing a snowsuit.

212
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,603
A "Newfoundland Lobster Trap".

213
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,273
Don't know. Don't want to know.

214
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:21,303
Those Newfies are out of control.

215
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,703
Okay! Okay, I'm going
to make my first guess.

216
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,173
Okay, but I'll only tell you if you

217
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:29,033
correctly guess the person,
the act and the collection.

218
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:30,133
Okay, I'm going to go.

219
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:32,003
Bryan Adams.

220
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,973
He collects baseball cards,

221
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:38,633
and he wanted to do a "Greasy Kayak."

222
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,073
No.

223
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,133
Wayne Gretzky, vintage Hot Wheels,

224
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,973
a "Squatting Eskimo."

225
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:46,073
Nah-uh.

226
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:49,403
Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir shot glasses,

227
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,973
and a "Sticky Flapjack."

228
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:53,333
No.

229
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:55,233
That I would have done.

230
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:56,303
Wait.

231
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,003
Wait, if they pulled the plug
on the project a month ago,

232
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,873
why have I been going in once a week

233
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:03,473
to meet with the New
Headquarters Task Force.

234
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,433
Well, obviously you couldn't come in

235
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:06,603
and pitch to Bilson.

236
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:09,703
So, we... invented the task force.

237
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:13,003
Then it was just a question
of putting together the team.

238
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:17,103
You know Roy Waterman,
Vice President of Capital and Risk.

239
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,133
He's actually...

240
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:19,827
Roy the janitor.

241
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:21,503
Hey. Excuse me, Roy.

242
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
How'd you like to make a few extra bucks.

243
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:27,069
How naked do I have to get

244
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:31,633
Louisa Mendoza, Executive
Vice President of Assets.

245
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:33,233
She's actually...

246
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:35,063
Louisa the lunch lady.

247
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:37,163
Louisa, I need your help with something,

248
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:39,103
but you can't tell anybody.

249
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,303
No hablo Ingles.

250
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,663
Exactly.

251
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:44,763
This is a big secret.

252
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:46,363
How do you say "secret" in Spanish.

253
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:48,363
Albondigas?

254
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:51,303
Ah, yes. Albondigas.

255
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:55,433
This will be our little albondigas.

256
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,603
Hey, can I, uh, have a
couple meatballs, please.

257
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:02,433
And Arthur Nasmith,
the eccentric genius guru

258
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,303
of corporate investments.

259
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,763
He's actually...

260
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:09,403
Crazy Arty, 15th Street's own one-man band.

261
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,363
Excuse me.

262
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:11,439
Do you have a minute to talk.

263
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:13,203
Actually, my assistant, Reginald,

264
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,273
makes all my appointments.

265
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:22,017
<i>We rounded out the group with a few interns</i>

266
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,017
<i>and paied everyone 50 bucks to act</i>

267
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,217
<i>super interested in what you were saying.</i>

268
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:35,987
Reginald, get me out of this for next week.

269
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:38,647
That was some of the
most inspired design work

270
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:40,517
I've done in my entire career.

271
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:41,687
I was so excited.

272
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:46,987
Alex Trebek, a "Musty Goaltender",

273
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:48,517
- Beanie Babies!
- Nope.

274
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,547
Damn it!

275
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:50,887
Wait.

276
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,817
So that explains the thing
that happened with Louisa.

277
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:55,647
- Good job, buddy.
- Nice, nice!

278
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:00,917
Listen, Louisa.

279
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:04,647
What are we gonna to do about this?

280
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:08,317
Don't act like you don't
know what I'm talking about.

281
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:09,817
I know you feel it, too.

282
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:12,817
What the hell.

283
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:16,317
No, no puedo.

284
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,887
Me voy a casar con el senor Barney.

285
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:25,417
No! No!

286
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,217
No, this is wrong!

287
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:30,447
For God's sake, you're on the task force!

288
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:34,567
Is there anything else you want to tell me.

289
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:38,347
Well, um, you know how you played

290
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:40,247
third base for the GNB softball team.

291
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:43,417
There is no GNB softball team.

292
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:45,717
We just rented out a field,

293
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,263
rounded up a bunch of guys and told them

294
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,647
to make you the hero.

295
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,987
So my game-winning walk was a lie.

296
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,487
We're sorry, Ted, but we knew that

297
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:54,863
you'd be out of work soon, and we just...

298
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:56,263
We just wanted to make you feel good.

299
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,247
You know, that's what friends do.

300
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:58,517
Lie to each other.

301
00:11:58,547 --> 00:12:01,017
Sometimes, yeah, to
protect each other's feelings.

302
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:03,417
No way! You never lie to your friends.

303
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:05,017
I would never not be honest with you.

304
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:06,294
Really What about that

305
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:08,517
open mic night at the comedy club.

306
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:10,787
Are you like me, folks.

307
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,687
Have you ever thought about how many

308
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:14,647
different kinds of fish there are.

309
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:18,587
And the names of those fish.

310
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:21,417
Let's, uh, let's take a little ride.

311
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:26,847
"Trout." Am I right.

312
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:29,547
"Sturgeon." I don't think so, pal.

313
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:31,987
"Salmon."

314
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,117
I'm going to say that again, salmon.

315
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:37,087
Who thought that was a good idea, right.

316
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:40,347
"Bass." This guy over here
knows what I'm talking about.

317
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,287
"Halibut."

318
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:44,987
Thank you, good night.

319
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:48,987
How was I.

320
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:51,047
Oh, you were great. Really funny.

321
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:53,387
You killed

322
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:56,547
everyone's Thursday night.

323
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:57,887
Time out.

324
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,717
You didn't like the fish list.

325
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:02,787
It was horrible! You
just read a list of fish.

326
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:08,517
Anyway

327
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:10,417
you guys just proved my point, okay.

328
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,247
You lied to me to protect my feelings.

329
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:13,617
This is completely different!

330
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:17,417
I just wasted a month of my
life working on a dead project.

331
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,523
That's time I could've spent

332
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,023
trying to bring my firm new business.

333
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,947
Instead, I'm going to go
in there tomorrow morning.

334
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:24,317
I'm probably going to get fired.

335
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:25,917
Best case scenario,

336
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,747
my boss is going to ream
me out in front of everybody.

337
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:31,863
Back home, we call that a Sas...

338
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:32,887
"Saskatoon Totem Pole."

339
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:33,917
- Yes.
- It's on here.

340
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:42,746
Good morning, lying bastards.

341
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:44,686
Anything you want to lie about

342
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:46,716
before I head off to work to get fired.

343
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:48,486
- That's a nice shirt.
- You're the devil.

344
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:50,586
Ted, what if we told you that we found you

345
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:52,846
a new project at GNB where you would be

346
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:54,586
redesigning part of the 20th floor.

347
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,146
Well, if that's a lie, it's
an incredibly dull one.

348
00:13:58,186 --> 00:13:59,546
What exactly would I be doing.

349
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:02,546
This is the 18th Floor E.T.R.

350
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:05,116
Basically, Bilson wants
a room just like this,

351
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,816
only two stories up, on our floor.

352
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,016
Wait, what's an E.T.R.

353
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,286
It's the Employee Transition Room.

354
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,786
- What does that mean.
- Well, it's a space

355
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,946
where a supervisor and an employee

356
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,786
engage in a knowledge transfer

357
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:19,486
about an impending
vocational paradigm shift.

358
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:21,816
People get fired in here.

359
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:24,086
That's horrible.

360
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:26,286
Why do you need a room
specifically for firing people.

361
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:29,616
Well, um, GNB feels
that people need a safe,

362
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:32,046
secure space to deal with the news.

363
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:33,446
Yeah.

364
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,516
It gets pretty real in here.

365
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:24,116
So I reluctantly agreed to design a room

366
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:25,786
where people would be fired.

367
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:27,416
But I was determined to make it my own.

368
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,386
Now, when you leave the dismissal space,

369
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,016
you'll exit into what

370
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:34,786
I'm calling the Rebirth
Tranquility Hallway.

371
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,916
Uh-oh.

372
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:39,786
Here, you'll find a soothing oval chamber

373
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:41,786
with a trained grief counselor.

374
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,846
It's right here, past the
New Beginnings Fountain.

375
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:45,516
Uh-oh.

376
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:46,716
And there you have it.

377
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,546
Instead of a drab, dark prison cell,

378
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,686
a nurturing womb

379
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,246
birthing you into a new life.

380
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,386
I love it.

381
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,086
Really - Yeah.

382
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:00,246
Nice work, Ted.

383
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:01,286
Thank you.

384
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:02,592
Can you add some of these touches

385
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,746
to the existing 18th Floor E.T.R. as well.

386
00:16:04,786 --> 00:16:06,786
- Absolutely.
- Great.

387
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:09,146
Let's take a look.

388
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:14,546
Okay, so I'm thinking this wall...

389
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:15,546
You're fired!

390
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,586
What!

391
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:17,716
I wanted this room!

392
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:20,746
This exact room two floors up!

393
00:16:20,786 --> 00:16:21,516
But...

394
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:23,116
You're fired!

395
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:24,346
Now, get the hell out of here.

396
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:29,486
Hey, honey.

397
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,046
Anyone from the band Rush,

398
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:40,486
a "Montreal Meatpie,"
and superhero lunch boxes.

399
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:41,946
No.

400
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:44,786
Okay. Rick Moranis,

401
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,786
"The Reverse Rick Moranis,"

402
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:48,346
antique Judaica.

403
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:50,316
- Nah-uh.
- I give up.

404
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:52,646
I've been guessing for three days.

405
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:53,786
I-I-I'm done.

406
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:55,446
If that means I never get to know,

407
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:57,286
- so be it.
- Fine.

408
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,786
Tell us! Tell us!

409
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,146
Tell us!

410
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,716
Okay, you really want to know.

411
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:03,086
Yes! Yes! Yes!

412
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,946
But this information

413
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:07,646
does not leave this table.

414
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:10,586
Oh, my, God.

415
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,116
I am so excited.

416
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:15,192
- Oh... I'm going to read it.
- Read it.

417
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,322
- I'm going to read it.
- Read it.

418
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:18,246
I'm going to read it. Here we go.

419
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:20,586
"The Frozen Snowshoe,

420
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:24,516
Old King Clancy, Harvey's trays."

421
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:28,216
Right

422
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:31,246
I don't know what any of those words mean.

423
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:35,146
Is one of those supposed to be a celebrity.

424
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,886
Yeah, who the hell is Old King Clancy.

425
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,116
No, that's not the person,

426
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:42,316
that's the sex act.

427
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:44,486
It's the same as a Sacramento Turtleneck,

428
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:45,986
except with maple syrup.

429
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:49,646
So the celebrity was Harvey Straze.

430
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:51,516
No, that's what he collected.

431
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:52,746
Harvey's trays.

432
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,986
Those classic orange trays you get

433
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:56,216
whenever you eat at Harvey's.

434
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,916
The restaurant.

435
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:00,446
Oh, come on, you're road tripping

436
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:02,116
down the Trans-Canada Highway,

437
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,646
you get a hunger on
between Milverton and Wawa,

438
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,816
where you gonna strap on a feed bag, huh.

439
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:09,546
Harvey's. Over 12,000 served!

440
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,116
So the celebrity was...

441
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:14,346
The Frozen Snowshoe.

442
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:16,316
Oh, my God! You guys

443
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,016
have never heard of The Frozen Snowshoe.

444
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,186
He's only the most famous

445
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,586
professional wrestler in Canada.

446
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:26,186
I met him after he defeated
Reckless Rick Rogers

447
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:28,746
in the Kamloops Memorial Arena back in '02.

448
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,116
Classic match.

449
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:34,086
So you're saying The Frozen Snowshoe

450
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:36,316
invited you back to his place

451
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:38,446
to look at Harvey's trays,

452
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:41,546
and asked you to do an Old King Clancy.

453
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:43,016
Exactly.

454
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:46,116
And I'm serious, you cannot tell anyone.

455
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:48,646
Well, my hiccups are gone.

456
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:50,116
Possibly forever.

457
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:51,846
Canada!

458
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:53,546
You did it again.

459
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,316
You even found a way to ruin this.

460
00:18:56,346 --> 00:19:00,216
Why Why do we let you be a country.

461
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:01,946
Hey, mister mister.

462
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:03,416
Hey. Shouldn't you be upstairs

463
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:05,216
designing your big, fancy E.T.R.

464
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:07,686
- I'm off the project.
- What?

465
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:09,186
Bilson fired me.

466
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:10,316
You're kidding me.

467
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:12,786
So what does this
mean for you at your firm?

468
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,116
Are you going to get laid off.

469
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:17,086
Actually, I just quit.

470
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,086
Why.

471
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,646
Because I can't work for big,

472
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:21,516
heartless corporate clients anymore.

473
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:23,786
When I was pitching to your "task force,"

474
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:25,886
I was doing the most
inspired work of my career.

475
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,246
In a way, you idiots
reminded me how much fun

476
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:31,116
my job can be when I'm not answering

477
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:32,746
to the Bilsons of the world, so...

478
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:33,946
I quit.

479
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:37,916
They fired you, didn't they.

480
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:39,816
Yes, sir.

481
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,416
But I got a sweet severance package

482
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,946
and I've made a big decision.

483
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:45,116
I'm going to start my own firm.

484
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:46,016
Whoa, buddy. That's exciting.

485
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,286
Way to go. In this economy.

486
00:19:48,546 --> 00:19:50,546
So you're not mad.

487
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:53,846
As it turns out, I'm grateful.

488
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:58,056
So how'd it all go down
between you and Bilson.

489
00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:01,846
Well, after he proposed a
vocational paradigm shift,

490
00:20:01,886 --> 00:20:04,886
I made an impromptu presentation
using a four-pronged approach

491
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,362
that really brought him to his knees.

492
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:07,346
Hit him with a chair.

493
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,886
- Yep.
- That's my boy.

494
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:16,647
And this one, I got on the drive

495
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:17,847
from Milverton to Wawa.

496
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,617
That's pretty impressive,
The Frozen Snowshoe.

497
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,647
Please, we're friends. Just call me "Shoe."

498
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:27,017
Have a seat.

499
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,277
So, Shoe...

500
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,817
How would you like to give me

501
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:41,177
an Old King Clancy.

502
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:45,547
I think you should go.
