1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:03,836
Check it:

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,798
Three blonde babies drinking
bad decision juice at 8:00.

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,881
Nice rack radar.

4
00:00:10,423 --> 00:00:13,053
- That's my wife.
- No, I got to get going.

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,704
Seriously?
But they're blonde and drunk.

6
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:17,015
Isn't that your type?

7
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:20,060
Maybe I don't have a type, Lily.

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,244
God, do you think
the male mind is really

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:24,796
that simplistic,

10
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:27,343
that we all have one favorite type?

11
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:28,468
Geez.

12
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:29,903
Asian with some boob.

13
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:32,906
I'm gonna hit the bathroom,
then bail.

14
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:36,368
Okay, have you guys noticed
Barney's been acting weird lately?

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,678
Actually, yes.

16
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:39,883
You know how he always says
never buy a girl flowers,

17
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:42,016
'cause giving her a living thing
reminds her babies?

18
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,358
- Sure.
- Well, the other day,

19
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:47,796
I saw him at that flower shop
on 82nd buying roses.

20
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,597
- What?
- Now that you mention it,

21
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:52,467
Barney did do something kind of odd
at the office yesterday.

22
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:54,549
Okay, see you Saturday.

23
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:57,055
I'm thinking brunch,
farmer's market, maybe a hike.

24
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:59,127
I love you, too.

25
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:00,252
Bye.

26
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:04,986
I figured he was just talking
to some girl he was trying to nail.

27
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:07,061
Or Ted, but now I don't know.

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,800
Wait, do you think it's possible
that Barney Stinson

29
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,671
has a girlfriend?

30
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:14,597
Later.

31
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:16,741
Wait, Barney, hold on.
Where are you going?

32
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:17,909
Nowhere.

33
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:20,743
The beach.
It's winter. Lazer Tag.

34
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:22,581
Home. Shut up.
You're going somewhere.

35
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,711
Oh, my God.

36
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:27,419
He's meeting her right now.

37
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:33,356
- Where is Barney going?
- Yeah.

38
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:35,218
We're not even in Manhattan anymore.

39
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:36,887
Where's this girl live?

40
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,139
We're talking about a woman
who's gotten Barney Stinson to commit.

41
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:41,764
I'm guessing Narnia.

42
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,382
He's stopping.

43
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,018
- What are you guys doing here?
- Where is she?

44
00:01:59,143 --> 00:02:00,869
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.

45
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:06,083
You really don't have a type,
do you?

46
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:09,021
These are my friends.

47
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,006
Guys,

48
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:14,429
this is Loretta.

49
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:17,177
- My mom.
- It's so nice to meet you.

50
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:19,346
I feel like I already know you all.

51
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:22,432
Barney goes on and on about you
every day when we talk.

52
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,101
You call your mom every day?

53
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:27,536
Mom!

54
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,230
So that's what you were being
all secretive about?

55
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:34,319
You didn't want us to know
you're a big old mama's boy.

56
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:38,114
Yep, you got me.
Well, guess you guys can leave.

57
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,496
Who are all these people?

58
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,662
I'd like you to meet Betty

59
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:50,835
my wife.

60
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,173
And my son Tyler.

61
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:16,677
Betty and I are gonna get dinner ready.
There'll be plenty for everyone.

62
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:18,231
But remember you,

63
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:20,853
only one helping of meatloaf
after what Dr. Grossbard

64
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:23,703
- said about your cholesterol.
- This one wants me to live forever.

65
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,828
Guilty.

66
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,355
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

67
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:30,274
- I love you three!
- Get out of here, you little scamp!

68
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:35,863
- So, I'll see you guys back at the bar?
- What the hell, Barney?

69
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,010
OK, it's a long story.

70
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,620
As you know, my father
had to leave my mom

71
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:44,747
when I was a baby because he got hired
as the host of The Price is Right.

72
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,750
- It was a very good show.
- Bob Barker is your father.

73
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:51,723
She had to raise
my brother and me by herself.

74
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,910
And her only wish was for her sons

75
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,593
not to wind up alone, like she was.

76
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,763
Then about seven years ago,
she got really sick.

77
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:04,029
It looked like
she wasn't going to make it.

78
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:07,258
So, I decided to make
her wish come true.

79
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:08,618
Mom.

80
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:11,430
This is Betty. We're engaged.

81
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:16,018
I hired an actress
to play my fiancée "Betty".

82
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:17,957
Her real name's Margaret.

83
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:20,532
She mostly does off-Broadway theater.
Wonderful actress.

84
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:22,449
This close to a Tony.
It's all who you know.

85
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:24,585
It's very political.
I shouldn't get into it.

86
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,410
But there's one problem.

87
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,917
Betty has a slight tendency
to go off-book.

88
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:32,959
You see, Mom?
I found someone who makes me happy.

89
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,422
Just like you wanted.

90
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:36,021
That's wonderful.

91
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:40,636
I just wish I could've stuck around
long enough for grandchildren.

92
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:42,941
I'm pregnant!

93
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,604
And then my mom got better.

94
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:53,622
Which was miraculous. But it meant
that I had to keep "Betty"

95
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:56,977
around and cast a kid
to play my son Tyler.

96
00:04:57,446 --> 00:05:00,656
This is crazy.
You actually cast your own son?

97
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:02,012
For a while,

98
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,827
I got by borrowing/babysitting
my neighbor's baby.

99
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,326
And this one Christmas,
when my mom was plowed on eggnog,

100
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:11,164
I got away with a bag of flour
and a Chuckie mask.

101
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:14,462
But eventually,
I had to hold auditions.

102
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:16,489
Four,

103
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:17,908
eight

104
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:22,136
13, you can stay.
The rest of you may go.

105
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,308
You said that if I slept with you,
my son would get the part.

106
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:29,852
Apparently,
I'm a better actor than your kid.

107
00:05:30,426 --> 00:05:32,396
Bring in the 11:00's!

108
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,530
And that's how the role of Tyler
eventually went to...

109
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:38,215
Grant.

110
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,989
- Come on, Grant seems pretty good.
- You think so?

111
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,878
Watch this. Hey, Tyler.

112
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:54,001
- Grant.
- Yeah?

113
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,088
See?
It's like amateur hour over here.

114
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,876
Call me crazy, but child actors
were way better back in the'80s.

115
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:07,451
It looks like your mom kept

116
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,930
your childhood bedroom
just the way you left it.

117
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:12,886
<i>That sure is a big poster
of The Karate Kid above your bed.</i>

118
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:14,522
<i>Karate Kid's a great movie.</i>

119
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:19,131
It's the story of a hopeful young karate
enthusiast whose dreams and moxie

120
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:21,904
take him all the way
to the All Valley Karate Championship.

121
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:25,700
Of course, sadly, he loses
in the final round to that nerd kid.

122
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,549
But he learns an important lesson
about gracefully accepting defeat.

123
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,513
<i>Wait.
When you watch The Karate Kid,</i>

124
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:36,210
you actually root
for that mean blond boy?

125
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:39,735
No, I root for the scrawny loser
from New Jersey

126
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,507
who barely even knows karate.

127
00:06:42,112 --> 00:06:46,053
<i>When I watch The Karate Kid,
I root for the karate kid:</i>

128
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,547
Johnny Lawrence
from the Cobra Kai dojo.

129
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:50,975
Get your head out of your ass, Lily.

130
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:56,147
Okay, I just figured out
where I know you from.

131
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,800
I saw you perform
at the Disorientation Theater

132
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:03,863
in Bertolt Brecht's Die Heilige
Johanna der Schlachth felast fall.

133
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,991
You were a revelation!

134
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:09,479
- Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:10,604
Thanks.

136
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,998
I wasn't sure. I mean, the point
of Brecht's work, of course, is to...

137
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,000
Alienate the audience. Sure.

138
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:19,378
Sorry.
Brecht-o-phile right here!

139
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:22,423
You really know your theater.

140
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:26,783
Lady Theater grabbed my heart early on
and she never let go.

141
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:28,790
Every year at Christmas,

142
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,475
I'd put on a little play for the parents
with all the other kids.

143
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:35,644
Gee whiz, Santa, do you think
we can take off in this kind of snow?

144
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:37,063
Cut! Cut!

145
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:39,190
Cut! Ricky!

146
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,478
Grandma and Grandpa
are gonna be here in half an hour,

147
00:07:41,568 --> 00:07:43,554
and you're still butchering
my words.

148
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,279
Looks like I'm gonna have to write,
direct and star in this thing.

149
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:48,373
Give me your elf hat. Go sit.

150
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:51,118
I always secretly wanted
to be an actor.

151
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:54,096
It's one of those life dreams
that just slipped away, I guess.

152
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,041
Listen, if you want,
I could give you some tips on acting.

153
00:07:57,307 --> 00:07:58,751
- Really?
- I'd love to.

154
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:02,827
Acting rule number one...

155
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:05,758
At least someone's still excited
about acting.

156
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
I miss that.

157
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:10,262
So, you don't like playing
Barney's son?

158
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,932
I hate it. But what can I do?

159
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:16,054
- The phone just ain't ringing.
- I know what you mean.

160
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:17,594
I'm a newscaster.

161
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,189
But I just had to take a job
hosting a local morning show

162
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,316
that airs at 4:30 in the morning.

163
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:27,035
I just thought I'd be so much
further along by this point, you know?

164
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm almost 30.

165
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:30,324
Come on, you still look great.

166
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:32,993
I love your nose job.

167
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:35,204
I never had a nose job.

168
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:36,599
Right.

169
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,176
Me neither.

170
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,129
I can't believe
we haven't met you before.

171
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:45,548
Who knew Barney
had such a great mom?

172
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:47,027
Thanks, dear.

173
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,594
Truth is, I wasn't always
the best mother when I was younger.

174
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:53,431
Don't say that.
I'm sure you were great.

175
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:55,933
Yeah, I was a bit of a whore.

176
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:57,810
Excuse me?

177
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:00,438
A whore, dear. A dirty whore.

178
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:02,773
I'm not proud of it.

179
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,037
But

180
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,777
still, I had some fun.

181
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,409
There is no thrill equal to

182
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:13,355
looking into some guy's eyes
and thinking,

183
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,418
"I don't know your name,
you don't know mine, but,

184
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:18,815
"for the next eight minutes,

185
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,163
"we are gonna rock
this gas station bathroom"

186
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:23,043
"right off its foundation."

187
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:27,506
And then just drive off
in opposite directions.

188
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,594
Just keep driving.

189
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:35,726
Barney's mom?

190
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:36,891
Loretta.

191
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:41,395
Anyway, that's,
that's all in the past now.

192
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:44,002
I did the best I could, but

193
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:48,235
sometimes I wonder how Barney
turned out to be so perfect.

194
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:52,078
You have to tell your mom
the truth, okay?

195
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:53,846
Listen, she is a sweet,

196
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:57,745
caring, slightly too graphic woman
who deserves better.

197
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:00,581
No way. The truth would kill her.

198
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,658
I don't feel right

199
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:05,270
about lying to such
a kindhearted woman, okay?

200
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:07,922
She reminds me of my own mother.

201
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:11,759
- What?
- Kindhearted?

202
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,262
Remember in our wedding vows
when I said we'd be together forever?

203
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:19,832
On our way back up the aisle,
your mother leaned in and she said,

204
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:23,354
"Not forever, sweetie.
Marshall's going to heaven."

205
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,916
- She was making a joke.
- She hates me, Marshall.

206
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,506
But that's okay because...

207
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,910
Never mind.

208
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:33,072
What were you gonna say?

209
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:36,474
Nothing. Do you want to go do it
in Barney's childhood bedroom again?

210
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,453
- On the race car bed?
- Handles great, buddy.

211
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:43,999
Look, Lily, if today has taught us
nothing else, it's that

212
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,669
honesty is important
when it comes to family.

213
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,313
Now, whatever you're feeling
towards my mother,

214
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:53,585
we've been together
for 12 years, baby.

215
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:56,971
- I think that I can handle it.
- Really?

216
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,481
I hate your mom.

217
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,035
Guess what?

218
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:05,604
I hate you!

219
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:10,985
Two minute warning for meatloaf!

220
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:12,365
Meatloaf?

221
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,363
Tyler no likey!

222
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,453
We have been over this
a million times!

223
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,746
- You are not getting a catchphrase!
- But it's funny.

224
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,333
I am not afraid to recast.

225
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,705
Now go memorize your lines
for the big dinner scene.

226
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:33,882
Wait. So you wrote the dinner
we're about to have?

227
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:35,680
Just a short script.

228
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:37,939
Just things that will make
my mom happy to hear.

229
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,179
What kind of things?

230
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:41,181
And I really thought

231
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,517
Barney had forgotten
our anniversary.

232
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:47,938
So I storm out to the backyard,
and there's smoke coming out of my ears.

233
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,899
Nostrils flaring. Her nostrils flare
when she gets mad. I love it.

234
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,819
Doing it right now.
Doing it right now!

235
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,187
You better stop, mister!

236
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:58,865
Sorry, sorry, boo bear. Continue.

237
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:01,546
This is what you're actually
like in a relationship.

238
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:04,643
So I storm out
to the backyard and

239
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:07,708
candles everywhere,

240
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:10,044
and a string quartet.

241
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:13,589
- Can you believe that?
- No, not even slightly.

242
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:17,092
What about my little Ty-Ty.
What have you been up to?

243
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:18,715
Funny story:

244
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,722
Just the other night,
this little rascal had a nightmare.

245
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,999
When he came in
to tell us what it was about,

246
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:25,866
do you remember
what you said, champ?

247
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:31,387
Page four.

248
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:39,114
The dinosaur bones in the museum
came to life and started chasing me?

249
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,949
Thanks a lot, buddy.
I didn't need to sleep tonight.

250
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:45,890
Tyler said, "My nightmare was"

251
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,860
"that you and Mommy didn't
know how much I loved you."

252
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,418
"So I wanted to come in
and tell you it was this much."

253
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,589
That's so sweet.

254
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,608
We're a sweet happy family.

255
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,321
'M gonna grab some ice cream
from the freezer downstairs

256
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,819
and then we'll all hit
the sundae bar in the kitchen.

257
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:09,202
Not a weak link in that scene.

258
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:10,437
Bravo.

259
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:13,549
Back off, Barney.
You have no idea how hard it is

260
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:15,192
to do a job that's beneath you.

261
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:19,612
I really enjoyed your thing
about the dinosaur bones.

262
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,824
Can we please stop talking
about the dinosaur bones?

263
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:25,452
Just go eat your sundae.

264
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,466
I can't. I'm lactose-intolerant.

265
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:32,126
Guess who's not
lactose-intolerant? Tyler.

266
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,956
Tyler is gonna go in there

267
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,604
and enjoy every last bite.

268
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:39,341
Ice cream time, gang.

269
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,510
Yummers!

270
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,117
My God!

271
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:47,960
Tyler no likey.

272
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:50,591
You're not getting a catchphrase.

273
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,852
I don't understand.

274
00:13:58,374 --> 00:13:59,374
I do.

275
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:04,025
Follow my lead.

276
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:05,194
I've

277
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:07,261
been betrayed

278
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,946
by my best friend.

279
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,823
How could you do this, Ted?

280
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,367
Think about poor Tyler

281
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:16,371
bravely trying to hold back tears.

282
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:19,681
It's okay, son, you can cry.

283
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:22,981
Cry!

284
00:14:24,494 --> 00:14:27,048
I don't want my mommy
and daddy to get divorced!

285
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:35,765
What could you possibly have
to say for yourself?

286
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:38,934
Acting rule number one:

287
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,103
"Don't be afraid to improvise."

288
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:44,545
Was it me who betrayed you,

289
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,718
or you who betrayed me?

290
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:49,814
I'm sorry. What?

291
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:52,323
Acting rule number five:

292
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:55,633
"Invent a rich back story
for your character."

293
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,523
November 14th, 1998.

294
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:02,216
The overnight train to Monte Carlo.

295
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,336
I was in the billiards car

296
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,589
hustling some Algerians
out of few thousand dinar,

297
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,750
when you seduced my fiancée!

298
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:16,973
Who is blind and thought
you were me.

299
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:21,309
What in God's name
are you talking about?

300
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:23,228
Acting rule number eight:

301
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:25,481
Don't be afraid to get physical.

302
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,661
You know damn well
what I'm talking about!

303
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:30,903
No, I don't!

304
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:33,853
Yes, you do! And by God,

305
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:36,511
I'll hear you say it, scoundrel!

306
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:39,452
Mom, can you give us a sec?

307
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:44,831
There's chocolate and butterscotch.

308
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:47,822
There's various kinds
of sprinkles and marshmallows.

309
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,133
Have you lost your mind?!

310
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:55,010
You were amazing!

311
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:58,097
You completely just became
that character.

312
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:00,088
Honestly,
I wasn't so much playing Ted

313
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:02,308
as I was just trying
to get out of Ted's way.

314
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:04,937
What is wrong with you people?

315
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:07,314
How am I ever gonna
explain this to my mother?

316
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:10,167
Maybe it's time
to tell her the truth.

317
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:13,365
I don't know, Lily.
Sometimes, honesty leads people

318
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,116
to say mean things about a woman
who always took special care of me

319
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:19,117
because I was the
runt of the family.

320
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:22,463
For crying out loud,
I'm only six-four!

321
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:27,220
How good was my crying?

322
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:29,170
You nailed it. See?

323
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:32,715
Even at a gig you hate,
you still managed to love what you do.

324
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:36,051
Maybe that's how it will be
for you at your new job.

325
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:38,592
- You think so?
- I know so.

326
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:40,634
Thanks, Grant.

327
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:43,215
You're pretty smart, you know that?

328
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:49,473
Sorry! Sorry!

329
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,817
Thought I was picking up
on something.

330
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,029
Honey, are you okay?

331
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,240
Look, Mom,
there's something I have to tell you.

332
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:01,368
Something I should have
told you a long time ago.

333
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:07,875
Tyler is dying.

334
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:11,542
And Betty said that when he goes,

335
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,127
she's gonna off herself.

336
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:15,924
So that's probably
all gonna go down pretty soon.

337
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:17,218
Oh, my God!

338
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:20,953
None of that is true!

339
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:23,015
The truth is, I...

340
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:29,798
The truth is Betty and Tyler
are actors

341
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,691
that I hired
to pretend to be my family.

342
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:34,246
What?

343
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:37,326
I just wanted you to think
I had the life

344
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:39,782
you wanted for me.
I wanted you to be proud of me.

345
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,078
I know it sounds crazy,
and I am so sorry, Mom.

346
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,747
So Betty is not your wife?

347
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:50,112
Thank God!

348
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:52,459
I do not like that woman.

349
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,149
- Really?
- Yes.

350
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,321
And Tyler...

351
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:01,464
I know I'm his grandma
and I'm supposed to love him,

352
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,118
but I hate that kid.

353
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:04,557
"Tyler no likey!"

354
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:06,474
- What the hell is that?
- Right?

355
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:10,521
Those fake friends of yours out there,
I just wanted to shoot myself.

356
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,931
I know! Aren't they horrible?

357
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,943
So really, really, you're not mad?

358
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,698
I'm just confused. I don't know
why you thought you had to do this.

359
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,376
Barney, I love you, perfect
family or no perfect family.

360
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,328
I love you no matter what.

361
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:28,927
- Really?
- Really.

362
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:37,062
I am so relieved

363
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:40,571
because the truth is
I am as far from married

364
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:42,571
as a human being can possibly be.

365
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:45,514
My history with women
would shock and appall you.

366
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:47,689
Doesn't matter.
I still love you.

367
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,351
Seriously, you can't imagine
the things I have done.

368
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:53,443
Barney, when you were three,
I left you with a babysitter

369
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:56,193
and spent three weeks
with Grand Funk Railroad

370
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:58,110
being passed around like a bong.

371
00:18:58,754 --> 00:18:59,754
Mommy!

372
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,381
Just do me a favor.

373
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:04,632
If you ever do meet someone special,

374
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:07,003
don't run away from it.
Don't be me.

375
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,510
Take a shot at it, will you?

376
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:12,592
Cab's here.

377
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:17,143
I'll try.

378
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:22,094
<i>And so ended one of the strangest
afternoons of our lives.</i>

379
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:25,480
And I just wanted to say to you,

380
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:27,790
if I ever seemed cold

381
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,544
or unwelcoming, I'm sorry.

382
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:32,478
Who's she talking to?

383
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:33,647
My mom.

384
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:37,707
It would mean a lot to me
if you and I could be closer.

385
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:42,351
Now take a deep breath like this next
thing is gonna be hard to say.

386
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:46,575
I love you.

387
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:47,894
I love you...

388
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:49,703
Mom.

389
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:51,872
Mom.

390
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:54,833
Now pretend I said something nice.

391
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,711
Now pretend I said something nice.

392
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:58,963
I mean,

393
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:02,508
that's very nice
of you to say, Judy.

394
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:06,345
You, too. Speak soon.

395
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,624
Let me get this straight.
You're really telling me

396
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,547
<i>that when you watch The Karate Kid,</i>

397
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:21,250
you don't root for Daniel-san?

398
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:26,187
<i>- Who do you root for in Die Hard?
- Hans Gruber,</i>

399
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:28,209
charming international bandit.

400
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:30,084
At the end, he died hard.

401
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,864
He's the title character.

402
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,506
<i>Okay, The Breakfast Club?</i>

403
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,712
The teacher running detention.

404
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:40,144
He's the only guy
in the whole movie wearing a suit.

405
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:42,776
<i>I got one. Terminator.</i>

406
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:45,775
What's the name of the movie, Robin?

407
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:49,217
Who among us didn't shed a tear

408
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:51,763
when his little red eye
went out at the end

409
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:54,116
and he didn't get
to kill those people?

410
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:57,843
I'm sorry. That movie...

411
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,791
I am never watching a movie
with you ever again.

412
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,043
They didn't even try to help him!
