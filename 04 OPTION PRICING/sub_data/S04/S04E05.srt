1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:02,669
Hey.

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,840
Hey, guys, how's it going?

3
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,873
I'm just gonna finish this.

4
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:10,230
We just had dinner with
Stella's sister and her fiancÃ©.

5
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:11,550
They're getting married before us.

6
00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:13,824
Okay, you know how you've dreamt
about your perfect wedding day

7
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:14,935
ever since you were a little girl?

8
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:15,959
- Yeah.
- Totally.

9
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:18,645
My sister is stealing
my dream wedding.

10
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:22,613
Down to every last detail...
on Shelter Island, at Sunset,

11
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:26,539
just down the beach from my family's
old summer house.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,886
It's my dream wedding.

13
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:30,571
I'm gonna finish this.

14
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:35,138
The lamb here
is supposed to be great.

15
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:36,825
I'm a vegan.

16
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,999
I wish I could tune out that
moral voice inside me that says

17
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,831
eating animals is murder,

18
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,425
but I guess I'm just not as
strong as you are.

19
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:47,220
That's 'cause you need protein.

20
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:49,910
I'll have the lamb.

21
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,859
Okay, new goal:

22
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:55,176
I want our wedding

23
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:56,599
to kick her wedding's ass.

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,790
I want our wedding

25
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,970
to take her wedding's head
and shove it in the toilet

26
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,709
and flush it, like, 20 times.

27
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:05,686
Ted, in high school, you were
her wedding, weren't you?

28
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,583
You know, she's always
trying to one-up me.

29
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:09,873
I mean, I love her, but

30
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:10,803
there's a little part of me

31
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:13,143
that kinda wishes this whole
thing would just fall apart.

32
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:15,953
I hate him. I hate him.
I hate him!

33
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:17,642
God, this steak is so good!

34
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:19,222
Four days to go
and he just runs off

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,216
with the vitamin consultant
from Whole Foods?

36
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:22,835
I gave up makeup for him.

37
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:24,547
I gave up showering for him.

38
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:26,471
I gave up shaving my armpits for him.

39
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:28,533
Hard to imagine
where it all went wrong.

40
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:31,195
And now it's so close to the wedding.
There's like

41
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,189
bacon or something in this
dipping sauce. I love it.

42
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:36,240
I can't get any refunds.
I'm gonna be out thousands of dollars.

43
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:38,253
<i>Kids, when you're in a relationship,</i>

44
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:40,858
<i>you develop a kind of telepathy
with your partner.</i>

45
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:42,465
<i>What do you think?</i>

46
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:44,060
<i>We could help her out.</i>

47
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:45,482
<i>No, Stella,</i>

48
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,766
<i>we should help her out.</i>

49
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,145
<i>Let's pay for dinner.</i>

50
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,670
Nora.

51
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:53,936
Don't worry.

52
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:55,766
We got this.

53
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,888
That's right.

54
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:57,979
We'll take over your wedding,

55
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,985
pay you back for
everything you spent.

56
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:02,248
Ted and I will get
married this Sunday.

57
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,916
We're getting married this Sunday?

58
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,752
Are we sure we're ready for this?

59
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:29,579
Ted, I wasted years
trying to get Lucy's dad

60
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:31,726
to decide he was "ready" for this,

61
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,268
but he never got ready for this.
That's why we never got married.

62
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:37,470
Come on, let's just be spontaneous.

63
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:41,012
I used to dream that Tony
would be spontaneous like this.

64
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,077
Okay, I'm in.

65
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:44,358
And I'm also

66
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:45,716
spontaneous.

67
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:51,626
I wish I hadn't done that.

68
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:55,966
<i>Kids, morals usually come
at the end of stories,</i>

69
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,637
<i>but this one is so important,
I'm gonna tell you now:</i>

70
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:01,757
<i>Don't ever, ever,
invite an ex to your wedding.</i>

71
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:03,470
<i>If someone had given me that advice,</i>

72
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,276
<i>well, it would have changed everything.</i>

73
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:07,661
Come on, you've got to come,
it's my wedding.

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,860
I can't. I'm in Tokyo.

75
00:03:10,118 --> 00:03:12,898
It's my first week on the job.
I can't just take off.

76
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,835
Plus, I'm finally doing serious news.

77
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:19,944
<i>Robin was doing serious news.</i>

78
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:22,654
<i>It was the number one
English news network in Japan.</i>

79
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:24,891
<i>Of course, the news
was a little different over there.</i>

80
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,921
Giant Fan!

81
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:31,458
The Federal Reserve Board
voted to leave interest

82
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:33,853
rates unchanged.

83
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:36,528
It's my wedding.
You have to be there.

84
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,299
Okay. I'll be there.

85
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:39,745
I gotta go.

86
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:42,466
Good evening.

87
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:46,899
And I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

88
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,477
Peace talks were stalled
once again in the Middle East.

89
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:53,926
Despite a promising start
in the latest negotiations,

90
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:57,170
talks foundered on security issues.

91
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:59,459
- She's in.
- Yes!

92
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:01,700
All right, Ted,
your bachelor party, tonight.

93
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:05,162
I have got three of the most
physically and morally flexible

94
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:06,861
exotic dancers
you've ever seen...

95
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:07,612
Can't, there's no time.

96
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:09,016
Okay, I'll let you know
how it goes.

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,163
Marshall, we should really rent
the cars for tomorrow?

98
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,233
Sure.

99
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:16,734
What?

100
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:19,233
No "Don't get married, Ted"?

101
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,931
No "You're making a big mistake, Ted"?

102
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,761
Barney Stinson

103
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:27,480
are you no longer committed
to the war on marriage?

104
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,432
No, I just know a hopeless
cause when I see it.

105
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:32,703
It's the same reason
I don't recycle.

106
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:37,224
Plus, Ted getting married
is in my best interest.

107
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:38,482
You see...

108
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:42,283
<i>Lately I've been working on a problem
of the utmost importance.</i>

109
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,450
<i>I confess I was stumped.</i>

110
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:48,905
<i>Until one night I decided
to tackle it once and for all.</i>

111
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:51,232
HOW CAN I HAVE SEX
WITH ROBIN AGAIN?

112
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:55,304
VULNERABLE

113
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,317
NOSTALGIC

114
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:00,807
BOOZE

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,972
Then, at last...

116
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,266
I cracked the code.

117
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:10,878
GET HER DRUNK AT TED'S WEDDING

118
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,417
- So you're back on Robin.
- Hopefully.

119
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,551
I mean, this weekend

120
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,805
is the best chance ever
to hook up with her again.

121
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,324
You'll never pull it off.

122
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:23,037
There's too many distractions.

123
00:05:23,143 --> 00:05:25,289
The first drunk
bridesmaid you see,

124
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,597
you'll have your head under her dress
like an old-time photographer.

125
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:31,289
Lily, don't cheapen this.

126
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,159
I don't want to sound all

127
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:35,189
mushy-gushy and romantic,

128
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:38,403
but this weekend,
Robin is the only woman I'm banging.

129
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:41,802
<i>And so, the day
before our wedding,</i>

130
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:44,817
<i>Stella and I made the trip up
to Shelter Island.</i>

131
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:47,292
<i>With everyone else
not far behind.</i>

132
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:49,826
- Zitch dog.
- Z-Z-Z... Zog...

133
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,268
This isn't exactly where I pictured
Ted getting married.

134
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,377
"The Namaste Yoga and Meditation
Collective."

135
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,164
I don't know about you guys,

136
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:01,369
but Nama-stay here
any longer than I have to.

137
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,721
Sweetie, go check
in with that dirty hippie

138
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,586
over there and
we'll get some drinks.

139
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,902
So, what scotches you got?

140
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:16,503
Here at the center, we have
a very strict no-alcohol policy.

141
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,650
Great, and all the meals
are included, right?

142
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:23,457
And they're all 100% vegan.

143
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:27,527
I need alcohol.

144
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:30,341
I'm not gonna get Robin
with this stuff.

145
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,667
Look at this.

146
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:35,489
Berry Blaster Brain Revitalizer.

147
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:38,242
My God, some of these drinks
could actually make a girl smarter.

148
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:39,896
What sort of hell
has Ted brought us to?

149
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:43,661
- There's no meat.
- There's no alcohol.

150
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,990
It gets worse:

151
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,177
I'm 90% sure that guy
you were talking with used

152
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,195
to be lead singer of the Spin Doctors.

153
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:52,866
Hey, guys,

154
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,306
Stella and I have a little problem.

155
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:57,852
The programs look great.

156
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:00,186
I mean, it's not our names
on the front, but otherwise,

157
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:01,394
really nice.

158
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,248
Hey, I talked to Robin.

159
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:04,549
She's running a little bit late,

160
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:06,180
but she'll be here
just under the wire.

161
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,968
You invited Robin?

162
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:09,129
Yeah, of course.

163
00:07:09,587 --> 00:07:10,877
You never told me that.

164
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,258
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

165
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,821
Can I help?

166
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:16,449
You feel glad.

167
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,042
You like Robin.

168
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:21,576
Yeah, but,
she's your ex-girlfriend.

169
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:22,963
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.

170
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,074
It is weird.

171
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,634
You don't get what's like for a bride

172
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:27,218
to see her groom's ex at their wedding.

173
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,549
Stella.

174
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,740
Your new husband used to nail me, like,

175
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:34,464
three times a day.

176
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:38,708
Having exes around,

177
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:41,195
I don't know, it brings up

178
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,048
unresolved things.

179
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:45,288
How do you know that spark
won't come back

180
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:46,552
with your ex sitting out there?

181
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:48,046
Come on, we're just friends.

182
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,154
Plus, Robin and I already had
our backslide

183
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:52,231
last Thanksgiving,
not even that long ago.

184
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,480
Did you place a large bet
against yourself in this argument?

185
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:57,392
She already got her ticket.

186
00:07:57,568 --> 00:07:59,668
Ted, it's important to me.

187
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,734
I would never invite Lucy's dad.

188
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,619
I wouldn't care if you did.
Tony's great. Let's invite him, too.

189
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:08,197
No, Tony is the last person
I want at our wedding, okay?

190
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:12,890
And Robin is a close second.

191
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:16,339
Robin's probably about to get
on the plane.

192
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:18,837
Plus, she left a really
important job for this.

193
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:23,914
Spurred by environmental concerns
and high gasoline prices,

194
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:28,888
sales of hybrid vehicles have risen
11% over the previous year.

195
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,172
What should I do?

196
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:31,829
I don't know.

197
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:33,621
I kinda get the no exes thing.

198
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:36,531
Why ask a filed romance to come
and watch your successful one?

199
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:39,435
It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners
to a World Series game.

200
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:40,714
It's weird for everyone.

201
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,740
What? No. Robin has to come.

202
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:45,460
Right, she's like, my best friend.

203
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,287
Female friend.
My best female friend.

204
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:50,915
Hey! Whoa! I don't care, why fake it.

205
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:54,105
Dude, Robin has to be here.

206
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:55,289
She shouldn't come.

207
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:56,962
- What are you talk...
- Justice Aldrin,

208
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,463
tie-breaking vote.

209
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:02,413
Okay, wouldn't feel right
without Robin.

210
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:05,180
But you don't mess with the bride.

211
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,195
I'm gonna tell her not to come.

212
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:09,416
- No, Ted.
- It's the right decision, Ted.

213
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:11,263
This is gonna be, like, the worst

214
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:12,603
phone conversation of all time.

215
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:13,835
Ted, Ted, Ted.

216
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,111
Co-best man... I'm on it.

217
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:22,416
Hello?

218
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:23,560
Robin, where are you?

219
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:25,402
Just heading to the airport.

220
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,698
Okay, well, see you soon.
Have a great flight.

221
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,426
Bad news. I couldn't reach her.

222
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:35,299
Robin's already in on her way.

223
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,533
Okay, Robin's on her way.

224
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,041
You know what, I'm glad.

225
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,340
Exes should be allowed
to come to weddings.

226
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:48,484
I'll just tell Stella
she's got to deal with it.

227
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,326
I think you need to be more delicate

228
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,121
with Stella about
this whole Robin thing.

229
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:53,411
What do you mean by delicate?

230
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:56,250
Brides are under a lot of stress
before a wedding.

231
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:59,049
I mean, of course,
I held it together pretty well.

232
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:02,897
You don't remember?

233
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,498
The florist just told me

234
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:10,061
the roses are more light medium-pink
than medium-pink.

235
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:11,902
Light medium-pink!

236
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,084
Everything's ruined.

237
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:18,222
Our wedding site uses a gravity furnace

238
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,204
instead of forced-air heating.

239
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:22,128
That's the one thing I cared about.

240
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,014
Why are we even getting married?

241
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,167
Blobbity-blah. Wickity-wah.
Eeky, eeky, eeky, eeky whee!

242
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:36,413
After a while, it's all noise.

243
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,523
Poor Stella's had to jam

244
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:40,834
months of crazy into just three days.

245
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:42,021
So what do I do?

246
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:43,930
You wait for the next crisis,

247
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,807
you solve it, you're a hero.

248
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:47,411
Then you bring up the Robin thing,

249
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,065
but this time, she'll say yes.

250
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,059
Yeah, but what if there's
no next crisis?

251
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:55,845
She's a bride.
There will be a next crisis.

252
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,846
Like four minutes later.

253
00:10:58,204 --> 00:11:01,465
- There's an next crisis.
- Awesome! What is it?

254
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:04,761
My daughter, my own daughter
isn't coming to our wedding.

255
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:05,901
What?

256
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:07,889
Tony's supposed to drive
her up tomorrow,

257
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:09,590
but now he's being all petty
about me getting married,

258
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:10,614
and he won't do it.

259
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:11,960
It's been five years.

260
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,755
Why can't we just move on already?

261
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,332
So first thing tomorrow
I drive down,

262
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:18,725
talk to him,
get him to let me drive Lucy up,

263
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,907
than, boom, crisis solved.

264
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:23,253
Stella's happy.
Robin comes to the wedding.

265
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,305
Hey.

266
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:26,575
You Barney?

267
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:27,405
Yes.

268
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,079
I hear you're a real man whore,
so listen up.

269
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:33,692
Tomorrow night I want to do things
so dirty and so depraved

270
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:35,897
that I forget that this
was supposed to be my wedding.

271
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:39,504
I... I'm kind of here with someone.

272
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:40,621
Bring her.

273
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,105
You're never going to make it.

274
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,502
<i>So, the morning of my wedding day
I made the trip back</i>

275
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:48,802
<i>to Tony's house</i>

276
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,069
<i>to get Lucy.</i>

277
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:55,098
- Hey...
- Tony...

278
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:57,432
Doing a little karate?

279
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:01,890
Sorry, sorry, man. You just

280
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:03,497
set off my internal defense alarm.

281
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:06,258
You got to watch these things.
Stay alert, stay alive.

282
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,510
- Right.
- So what brings you here?

283
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,334
I thought you'd be off
in some honeymoon suite

284
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:11,818
with my woman right now.

285
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:13,296
Not yet. Soon.

286
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,962
That's right, tonight's the night.

287
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:18,270
Yeah! Oh, man, you are going to be
sticking it

288
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:19,842
to the mother of my child.

289
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:22,552
Actually, I' already
stuck it to her plenty of times.

290
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:24,406
Why do I always have to correct people?

291
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:26,222
You and Stella.

292
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:29,378
You lucky dog. I could just...

293
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,292
I'm so happy for you guys.

294
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:38,161
Yeah... listen, here's the thing...

295
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:39,889
- Lucy...
- You can't take her.

296
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:41,973
Tony, stop. Look

297
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,944
this is a big day for Lucy, too.

298
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,242
You're going to have to put
aside your own issues

299
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,247
and think about
what's best for her here.

300
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:49,279
Whether you like it or not,

301
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,299
she really should be
at her mother's wedding. So,

302
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,197
I'm taking Lucy with me.

303
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,142
You're right, man.

304
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:00,564
You're right.

305
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,857
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just

306
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,500
seeing you guys

307
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,827
has made me realize everything I had.

308
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:12,803
Hey, hey... let's stop hugging.

309
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:14,718
I'm sorry.

310
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:17,859
Lucy means the world to me.

311
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,366
And I feel like I'm losing her
to this new family

312
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,774
a family I'm not even a part of.

313
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:22,856
Come on, sure you are.

314
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:25,000
No, I'm not. I wasn't even invited
to the wedding.

315
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:26,548
Well, you are now.

316
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:32,410
Road trip.

317
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:34,219
Right?

318
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:40,057
Road Trip 2... Back in the Car.

319
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:44,702
So, today's the day.

320
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,075
You hydrating?

321
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:49,747
Dear femal, thank you for your interest
in Barney Stinson...

322
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,208
Your back is going to look like
a Jackson Pollock.

323
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:55,844
I regret to inform you
that at this time...

324
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,545
I was a vegan for two years.

325
00:13:58,135 --> 00:13:59,542
I need meat.

326
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:02,428
There are
currently no positions available.

327
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,953
I'm a yoga instructor.

328
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:05,947
Every position is available.

329
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,875
Your room, 20 minutes.

330
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,028
No foreplay.

331
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:13,814
I'm not going to make it, am I?

332
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,444
Not a chance.

333
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,163
Okay, just remember,

334
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,864
Let me talk to Stella first, okay?

335
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,471
Mommy! Mommy!

336
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:26,477
Ted invited daddy!

337
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,304
Hi, sweetie. I missed you.

338
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,233
Give me just a sec, okay?

339
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:33,614
- Hey.
- Hey, Tony.

340
00:14:34,752 --> 00:14:36,394
- Hey.
- You invited Tony?

341
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,638
To our wedding?!

342
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:40,907
Ted, we talked about this.
No exes at our wedding.

343
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,345
Why would you do this?

344
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,183
Oh boy! What did Ted do this time?

345
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:53,443
Ted, what is Robin doing here?

346
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,886
I thought I made myself clear.

347
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,845
No exes at our wedding.

348
00:14:57,526 --> 00:14:58,690
To be fair

349
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:00,371
your ex is here.

350
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,517
You invited him!

351
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:04,391
- Come on, it's not weird.
- It is weird.

352
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:07,077
It's like things are not
finished between you two.

353
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:08,488
And Tony...

354
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:10,161
I can't talk with Tony right now.

355
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:12,120
Can you please go out there
and tell him to leave?

356
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,857
You can make me the bad guy.

357
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,247
I'll go talk to Robin, so she
knows it's nothing personal.

358
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:22,659
<i>And kids, if I had just let
Stella talk to Robin,</i>

359
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:24,583
<i>this whole story
might have ended differently.</i>

360
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:26,636
I understand.

361
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,386
I get it.

362
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:32,743
For the first time,
Ted and Stella Mosby.

363
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:35,969
<i>And that's how I met your mother.</i>

364
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,125
Is your dad finally done yakking?

365
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:40,845
Now, come on,
who wants ice cream?

366
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:43,719
<i>But I didn't.</i>

367
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:45,104
Look, can you talk to Tony?

368
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:46,693
Robin flew all the way here
from Tokyo.

369
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:47,766
I should talk to her.

370
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:50,525
Sure.

371
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:57,345
- Hi.
- Hey.

372
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,462
- Sorry about running off like that.
- Oh, it's okay.

373
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,126
You would not believe
the trip I just had.

374
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:03,756
I was on a plane
for almost a full day.

375
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:05,894
But it is worth it
to see you get married.

376
00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:06,891
How could I not be here...?

377
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:08,932
- You can't come to the wedding.
- Oh, thank God!

378
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:10,832
- What?
- Ted, it's weird.

379
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,932
- It's not weird.
- It is weird.

380
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:15,861
Do you know how it feels
to be somebody's ex at their wedding?

381
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,350
- Robin.
- Stella.

382
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,421
Suck it, bitch! I win!

383
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:25,240
We broke up over a year ago.

384
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,774
Yeah, but that's not that long ago.

385
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:28,888
Watching your marry

386
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,548
another woman isn't exactly
something I was looking forward to.

387
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,753
I don't know, I

388
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:36,075
I just thought if I ever
changed my mind about

389
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,034
marriage and kids, it was

390
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,216
it was nice to know
that you were there.

391
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:42,010
So, I was your safety school

392
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,994
- how flattering.
- Not that...

393
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,247
That's not it. It's just that...

394
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,913
Why are you bringing any of this up?

395
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:47,450
There's nothing between us anymore.

396
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:48,928
Well, maybe there is.

397
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:52,755
I mean, of course there is.
That kind of stuff just

398
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,359
doesn't disappear without a trace.

399
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:58,208
Look, I'm not just
another guest here, Ted.

400
00:16:58,373 --> 00:16:59,100
Right.

401
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:00,762
We used to date, but

402
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,381
we both moved on. And... look,

403
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,223
we got what we wanted...
I'm getting married,

404
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:06,006
you got your dream job in Tokyo.

405
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:08,215
- And they all lived happily ever...
- I quit my job.

406
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:11,026
- You what?
- I'm moving back to New York.

407
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,478
I thought I wanted that job, but...

408
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,575
I want to come back to my real life.

409
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:20,278
And I think you should go back
to yours.

410
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:22,154
What's that supposed to mean?

411
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,116
Don't get married.

412
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:30,032
Look, you're rushing into this.

413
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,463
It's like you're trying

414
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,422
to skip ahead to the end of the book.

415
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:36,085
Ted, you're the most romantic guy
I know. You...

416
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:37,903
You stole a blue French horn for me.

417
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,413
You tried to make it rain.

418
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,536
- I did make it rain.
- It was a coincidence.

419
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,140
But after all that,
this is how your great

420
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:46,510
romantic quest comes to an end?

421
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:49,028
You're just disappearing
into someone else's wedding,

422
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,066
someone else's

423
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:53,046
house, someone else's life
without a second thought.

424
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:56,811
That's not the amazing ending
that you deserve.

425
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,124
That's not Ted Mosby.

426
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:05,189
I love Stella.

427
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:07,734
She's the one.

428
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:10,168
If you really feel that way...

429
00:18:11,552 --> 00:18:14,457
I guess it's a good thing you're not
coming to the wedding after all.

430
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,855
- Big fight?
- Yeah.

431
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:28,134
Here...

432
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,476
It's on the house.

433
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,479
Just keep 'em coming.

434
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:37,100
Oh God, do not keep them coming.

435
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,613
Hey, Robin.

436
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:44,962
Barney.

437
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,636
I am having a horrible day.

438
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:49,971
I snuck some scotch in from
the duty free store.

439
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:50,862
You want to join me?

440
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,614
Yeah, yeah.
Let's go to your room.

441
00:18:52,743 --> 00:18:54,983
Far away from this room.
And we can knock it back.

442
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,438
They didn't get me a room.

443
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:59,488
I was actually hoping
I could stay with you.

444
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,494
No problem.

445
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:04,609
I just have to
straighten up little bit.

446
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,873
I've got some clothes
on the floor, and...

447
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:09,582
And a naked girl
tied to your headboard.

448
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:12,093
Towels all over the bathroom.
It's a mess.

449
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,251
So, anyway...
give me ten minutes

450
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,256
- to get the place in order...
- See ya, Barney.

451
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,710
Okay, let's do this.

452
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:33,821
Who the hell is that?

453
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,857
It's the girl from the front desk.

454
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:49,473
<i>Kids, sometimes you think
you're living out one story,</i>

455
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,792
<i>but the truth turns out
to be something else entirely.</i>

456
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,421
<i>At the time I thought the story</i>

457
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,532
<i>was about whether Robin
should be at the wedding.</i>

458
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:13,000
<i>If only I'd understood
what the real story was.</i>

459
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:23,745
<i>Having exes around...</i>

460
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,724
<i>I don't know, brings up</i>

461
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,472
<i>unresolved things.</i>

462
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:33,603
<i>How do you know that that spark
won't come back</i>

463
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:35,117
<i>with your ex sitting out there?</i>

464
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:40,994
<i>It's like things
are not finished between you two.</i>

465
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:45,882
<i>I wasted years trying to get Lucy's dad</i>

466
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:48,169
<i>to decide if he was ready for this.</i>

467
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:49,635
<i>Seeing you guys</i>

468
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:52,929
<i>it's made me alize everything I had.</i>

469
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:56,319
<i>I used to dream that Tony would be
spontaneous like this.</i>

470
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:04,058
<i>Seriously, kids,</i>

471
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:06,087
<i>never invite an ex</i>

472
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:08,398
<i>to your wedding.</i>
