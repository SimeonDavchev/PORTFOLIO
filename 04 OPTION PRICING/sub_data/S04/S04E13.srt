1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:03,107
<i>Kids, in a sophomore year of college,</i>

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,561
<i>when Aunt Lily came back
from spring break,</i>

3
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:07,948
<i>Uncle Marshall surprised her
at the airport.</i>

4
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:11,134
<i>And she surprised him with a six-pack
of locally brewed beer.</i>

5
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:13,214
Fort Lau-ger-Dale! Get it?

6
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,161
<i>And with that, a ritual was born.</i>

7
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:19,618
<i>For the next 11 years, whenever
either of them would fly anywhere...</i>

8
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:21,893
Minne-Cider! Get it?

9
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:25,196
<i>The reunion was always
commemorated with a chauffeur sign</i>

10
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:27,260
<i>and a six-pack
from wherever they'd been.</i>

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,262
Aspen Yards Ale!

12
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:30,948
Get it?

13
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:32,704
- Actually, no.
- Me, neither.

14
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:34,305
I was hoping you would.

15
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:37,297
<i>But then, one night
in January of 2009,</i>

16
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:38,660
<i>the unthinkable happened.</i>

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,670
- I'm not picking her up.
- What?

18
00:00:41,183 --> 00:00:43,656
Lily doesn't want me taking a cab
all the way to the airport

19
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:46,068
just to take a cab all the way back,
you know?

20
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:47,650
But the six-pack thing.

21
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:50,585
That stuff was fun
when we were younger,

22
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,111
but we've grown past that.

23
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:55,167
As we mature,
the relationship matures with us.

24
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,223
But...

25
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,643
I mean, you guys are such
an inspiration to the rest of us,

26
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,673
how you're so
devoted and connected.

27
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:01,894
I look at you guys,

28
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:04,005
and that's all I want
in the whole world.

29
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:07,406
There's two college girls outside,
and they look easy!

30
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:12,644
So, Arizona... You know,
I've always wanted to see

31
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:14,645
what an Arizona
driver's license looks like.

32
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:16,825
I already ran that play, bro.
They're 21. We're good.

33
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:19,118
Thank God. So...
what brings you guys to town?

34
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:21,708
- Our band's got a gig.
- You're in a band?

35
00:01:21,808 --> 00:01:24,830
- Hey, maybe we'll come see you play.
- Excuse us for a sec.

36
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:28,461
What the hell is
the matter with you?

37
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,684
- We're not gonna go see them play.
- Why not?

38
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:32,128
If we see them play,

39
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:34,490
we're no better than the
bleach-blonde bimbos

40
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,878
who flash their boobs
at a Van Halen concert.

41
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:40,407
Yeah, but don't those girls get to have
sex with Van Halen after the show?

42
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:43,290
If you want to have sex with Van Halen,
do it on your own time, Ted.

43
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,208
We are not the
maybe-we-can-come-see-you-play guys.

44
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:48,411
We're the other guys,
the older guys

45
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:51,826
who never showed up
and whose approval they now crave.

46
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:55,221
- So we're their dads?
- Exactly.

47
00:01:58,146 --> 00:02:00,949
It's a big meeting,
so I don't think we're gonna make it.

48
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,646
Maybe next time, kiddos.

49
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,525
But if you guys want to meet up
after your show,

50
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,046
- maybe we could exchange numbers...
- Excuse us for a minute.

51
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:11,050
Ted, have you gone completely insane?

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,093
We don't want their phone numbers.

53
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:16,089
I don't know what I was doing.
I guess I panicked out there.

54
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:18,846
When you exchange
numbers with a chick

55
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:21,507
you give them the ability
to call and cancel.

56
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:24,850
If you set a date without a number,
they have to show up.

57
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,107
Check and mate!

58
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:30,167
The only digits I need are these.

59
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,127
Honka.

60
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:35,676
Are you still their dad?

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,791
So, why don't we just meet here
tomorrow night around 10:00.

62
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:42,846
I think it's supposed to snow.

63
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:44,685
What do we do if there's a blizzard?

64
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:46,404
Either way, we'll be here.

65
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,034
"Snow" problem.

66
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:51,202
Excuse us just one last second.

67
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:54,559
What is the problem now?!

68
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:56,612
Nice one.

69
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,268
All right, we'll see you
tomorrow night.

70
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:01,848
- Totally.
- Awesome!

71
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,771
"Totally. Awesome!"

72
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,819
Man, these college chicks
sound stupid.

73
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,101
- Totally.
- Awesome.

74
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,848
So, here's the thing,
tomorrow night,

75
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:12,087
dress to move.
It's gonna be a mess!

76
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,467
I still think we should've gotten
their numbers.

77
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,219
You always assume
something is gonna go wrong.

78
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,306
Ted, I promise you,
nothing is gonna go wrong.

79
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:23,699
It's starting to snow.

80
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,482
<i>Kids, the blizzard of '09
was a monster.</i>

81
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:53,426
<i>It snowed for three days straight,</i>

82
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,355
<i>which led to three amazing stories.</i>

83
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,075
<i>I'll start with me and Barney.</i>

84
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,609
It's pretty nasty out there.
I don't think they're coming.

85
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,765
Of course they're coming.
They have to.

86
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:06,586
If I can land just one of these girls,
I'll have party school bingo.

87
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:13,612
Come on, Ted.
You're the only one here.

88
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:16,049
Sorry.
What's party school bingo?

89
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:20,877
Every year, Playboy releases a list
of the top party schools in the country.

90
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:23,397
I take the top 25, and I make up

91
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:25,040
a bingo card.

92
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:29,282
All I need is Arizona Tech,
which is crazy.

93
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:32,774
In league play, that would normally
be designated a free space.

94
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:35,997
So... how many people are in
on this party school bingo thing?

95
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,630
It's just me.

96
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:39,688
So what's the point, then?

97
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:42,805
The point is to get five in a row.

98
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:46,234
And what do you get
when you get five in a row?

99
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:50,136
I get bingo.

100
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,857
Thanks for coming by.

101
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,165
I monkeyed around with
the thermostat for about an hour

102
00:04:56,265 --> 00:04:58,412
before I realized it was the intercom.

103
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,611
Yeah, I heard you
swearing downstairs.

104
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:02,598
Hey, so... Lily's flight's coming
in tonight

105
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:04,468
you're really not
gonna go pick her up?

106
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:08,145
Like I said,

107
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:11,489
as we mature,
our relationship matures with us.

108
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:15,785
Yeah, well, if I know your wife, she's
gonna get you that six-pack anyway.

109
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,340
Puget Stout.

110
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:27,710
A most exquisite Seattle microbrew.

111
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,795
And speaking of six-packs...

112
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:38,785
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the airport.

113
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:41,917
How could I be so stupid?!
Of course she's bringing me a six-pack!

114
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:44,916
But this time,
I didn't bring him a six-pack.

115
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:49,451
Because... as we mature,
the relationship matures with us.

116
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,818
Well, he sounds like a nice young man.

117
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:56,559
I'll bet he surprises you
and picks you up anyway.

118
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:04,642
Where's my beer?

119
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,535
We said we weren't gonna.

120
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:10,172
I have beer.

121
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,533
A six-pack and you're an appropriate
height for me.

122
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:15,020
Let's go, New Lily.

123
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:19,441
I got to get some beer.

124
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,197
<i>Folks, this is your captain speaking.</i>

125
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,543
<i>Looks like we're going to be arriving
an hour early.</i>

126
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:29,056
Drink up, boys.
I'm closing the bar.

127
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:32,561
- It's only 9:00.
- And this place is ragin'!

128
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,493
Guys, I'm really sorry, but I got to go
set up cots in the church basement.

129
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:39,693
It doubles as a shelter
on snowy nights like this.

130
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:43,770
You selfish bastard! There are two very
hot girls coming here to meet us.

131
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,151
Can't you just leave the place open
a little while longer?

132
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:48,275
- We'll keep an eye on everything.
- You two? No way.

133
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,495
You wouldn't know the first thing
about running a bar.

134
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,338
Serve the hotties first?

135
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,119
Here's the keys.

136
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:00,524
Here's the keys.

137
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:02,082
As soon as your girls show up,

138
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:03,996
you turn off the lights
and you lock up.

139
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:06,578
I don't want to come back here
and find this place trashed.

140
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:07,716
Seriously?

141
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,026
I can trust you guys.

142
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,646
<i>To understand what it meant to us
to get the keys to MacLaren's,</i>

143
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:13,411
<i>I have to take you back a few years</i>

144
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,518
<i>to the night that I uttered
five little words</i>

145
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:18,185
<i>that every man at some point
in his life will say.</i>

146
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,946
- We should buy a bar.
- Of course, we should buy a bar!

147
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:25,251
- We should totally buy a bar.
- We should totally buy a bar.

148
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:27,693
- Our bar would be awesome.
- And dude

149
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:29,524
dude... dude

150
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
dude!

151
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,899
The name of our bar...

152
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:35,979
Puzzles.

153
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:39,117
People will be like,
"why is it called Puzzles?"

154
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,654
That's the puzzle.

155
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,277
That is

156
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,651
a great name for a bar!

157
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:48,953
And also, at Puzzles,

158
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,641
- no last call.
- No last call!

159
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:53,907
Only when every single person
is finished

160
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:55,937
having the greatest night
of his or her life

161
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:57,590
do we stack the chairs on the table

162
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,735
and power down
the three-story margarita waterfall.

163
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:03,659
- We should buy a bar.
- We should buy a bar.

164
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:06,199
<i>And like the other ill-advised
five-word sentences</i>

165
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,129
<i>every man eventually
says in his life...</i>

166
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,518
I can jump that far.

167
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:12,926
I'm gonna win her back.

168
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:14,875
I can trust you guys.

169
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:16,503
<i>We would come to regret it.</i>

170
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,328
<i>We just didn't know it yet.</i>

171
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,761
You have it?
Awesome... I'll be right there.

172
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,099
Wait a minute.

173
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,767
If you are getting off the plane,
where is Marshall?

174
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,181
- And where is your six-pack?
- That's the problem.

175
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:03,679
I have to get to Brewniverse
in East Meadow in an hour.

176
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:06,503
- To the Town Car!
- Thank you.

177
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,775
Barkeep. Triple Sec.

178
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:11,908
Coming right up, tap-minder.

179
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:16,737
We'll get one.

180
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,604
- Order up.
- Order up.

181
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,420
We'll get one.

182
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:27,500
Thank God you're still here.

183
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,731
I don't know if you guys
have ever seen Star Wars,

184
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:32,043
- but it's like Hoth out there.
- Dibs.

185
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:35,582
It reminds me of when I used
to go sledding with my dad

186
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:37,743
- before he left.
- And dibs.

187
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:40,469
So... can we warm you up
with a drink?

188
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:41,569
Sure...

189
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,374
By the way, I invited the rest
of the band to come and meet us.

190
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:47,216
We were hoping to get drunk.
I mean really drunk.

191
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,850
Like my dad used to.

192
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,060
Dibsity, dibsity, dibsity...

193
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:54,301
I guess we could keep
the place open a little bit longer.

194
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:56,367
As long as it's just
you and the band.

195
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:01,776
What kind of band is this?

196
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:04,869
We're the Arizona Tech Fighting Hens
Marching Band.

197
00:10:04,976 --> 00:10:06,144
Go, Hens!

198
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,507
<i>And then, your Uncle Barney and I</i>

199
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,961
<i>had one of our telepathic conversations.</i>

200
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:13,232
<i>Dude, Carl's gonna kill us</i>

201
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:15,573
<i>if we don't kick everyone
out of here right now.</i>

202
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:21,724
<i>Barney, I'm serious.</i>

203
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:23,960
<i>We promised we wouldn't mess
the place up.</i>

204
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,304
<i>All right, I guess you have a point.</i>

205
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,184
The bar is open!

206
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,257
Who wants a beer?

207
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,532
I still say this is stupid.

208
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:45,211
What happened to, "As we mature,
the relationship matures with us"?

209
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,777
That's just something Lily read
in Psychology Today.

210
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:51,771
All right, she read it in Cosmo.

211
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:53,575
All right, I read it in Cosmo.

212
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:56,718
All right, it was Cosmo Girl.
Just drive, okay.

213
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:58,580
I just don't get why
it's such a big deal

214
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,782
that one little ritual
goes by the wayside.

215
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:04,264
It's not just this, okay?
It's all our little rituals.

216
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,089
Do you know what we used to do
every day the second I got home?

217
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:11,445
Man, I don't want to hear
about your crazy monkey sex.

218
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:15,242
We would tell each other
what we had to eat that day.

219
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:20,316
Two eggs, a slice of cheese pizza
and some steamed veggies.

220
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:23,495
Everything bagel, chicken breast,
some celery sticks

221
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:25,522
and a spoon of peanut butter.

222
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:28,792
- Crazy monkey sex?
- Crazy monkey sex.

223
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:36,331
TMI... too many informations.

224
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:40,397
You know what else I miss?
Our lunchtime phone call.

225
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,837
It's lunchtime, and I love you.

226
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,497
I reciprocate in principle.

227
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:48,367
Although with the caveat
that there seems

228
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,743
to be a bit of a surplus
here on my end.

229
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,147
I love you more.

230
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,901
Do we need to get in a room together
and bang this thing out?

231
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,764
Those sound like agreeable terms,

232
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:06,538
although I may need to
adjust my briefs.

233
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,249
Love you, too.

234
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,483
But today when she called,

235
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:16,187
I let it go to voice mail.
Voice mail!

236
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:17,661
How could you?!

237
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:21,061
The thing I miss most is kissing
at midnight on New Year's Eve.

238
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,240
It was a New Year's tradition.

239
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,484
But you know what we did this year?

240
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:27,760
Crazy monkey sex?

241
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:35,668
All these cute, adorable
little rituals... they're stupid.

242
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,219
Telling each other what
you had to eat? You're like

243
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:40,058
children playing house.

244
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,228
Well

245
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,247
maybe you just think they're stupid

246
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,227
because you've never been
in a relationship

247
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,888
long enough to develop them.

248
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:47,739
What?!

249
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:49,251
You don't understand love.

250
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:53,221
Okay, you're like some robot
who sees a person crying and says...

251
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:55,270
"Why is that human leaking?"

252
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:57,259
Is that right?

253
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,695
Well, then... Robot initiating

254
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:04,122
pull-over-to-the-side-of-the-road-until-
jackass-apologizes-to-me sequence.

255
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:13,945
My robot was like,
a million times better.

256
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:21,162
Just so you know, the trough
in the bathroom is overflowing.

257
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,179
There's no trough in the bathroom.

258
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,917
And you just came out of the kitchen.

259
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:28,754
What's in a gin and tonic?!

260
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:30,494
What's in a gin and tonic?!

261
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,049
Running a bar sucks.
Let's just close up.

262
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:35,645
There's no last call.

263
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:37,522
Puzzles, go for Barney.

264
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:40,022
Good. You're still there.
I'll be there in five.

265
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:42,484
Last call.

266
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:51,349
Robin, there's a snowplow coming.
We have to get back on the road.

267
00:13:51,378 --> 00:13:54,073
You think the only way to be in love
is to have pet names.

268
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:56,266
Or leave each other stupid,
little notes

269
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:59,768
or go charging off into a blizzard
for no good reason.

270
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:02,648
Seriously, do you understand what's
going to happen if that plow comes by?

271
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:04,418
You know what you are?
You're a love snob.

272
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:06,494
There's lots of ways
to be in a relationship,

273
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,638
and you would know that if you ever left
your little love snob country club.

274
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:12,374
We're going to get buried by snow.
That's going to happen.

275
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
Screw this.

276
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:15,857
I'm not going to sit here
and be insulted.

277
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:18,638
We're not going to the airport.
We're going home.

278
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:23,621
What just happened?

279
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:32,542
We called earlier
about the Seattle microbrew.

280
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:36,436
Good thing you called when you did.
I was getting ready to close up.

281
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,747
Storm of the century out there.

282
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,589
Of course, it's only '09,
so storm of the century

283
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:43,675
might be a little bit premature.

284
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:47,532
Let's say storm of the year.
Although, it is only January.

285
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:51,205
We're in kind of a hurry, so,
we'll take the beer now.

286
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:53,347
You are a cute couple.

287
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:55,028
- Thank you.
- We're not a couple.

288
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,003
Thank God. That would be weird.

289
00:14:58,512 --> 00:14:59,512
Well

290
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:03,548
here she is. "Supersonic Tonic."

291
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:06,975
This is a keg.
I need a six-pack.

292
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:09,115
A keg's all I got.
We'll take the keg.

293
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:10,285
What?

294
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,744
Last time I had one of these
in the car,

295
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:17,176
I wound up chipping dried vomit
off the seat with a putty knife.

296
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,649
I'm sorry, Ranjit,
but this is a ritual

297
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:21,808
and I am bringing him this beer.

298
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:25,505
If you could just put it in the car.

299
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:28,208
I'll give you 50 bucks.

300
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:29,691
To the Town Car.

301
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,196
Robin, I'm sorry.

302
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,823
You're not a robot.

303
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:42,934
If you are, you're, like,
an incredibly advanced model,

304
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:45,180
and the human race
doesn't stand a chance.

305
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:47,643
You just don't choose to

306
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,868
show your love through corny rituals,
and that's fine.

307
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:53,958
But maybe the reason Lily and I
do is because we always have,

308
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:56,158
and we don't know any other way.

309
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:58,431
One thing I do know is that

310
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:01,066
if she's there sitting
at the airport alone,

311
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:03,526
I have to go get her.

312
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:05,441
Those are the rules.

313
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:09,356
Close your eyes.

314
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,495
I don't know how you heard any of that
as me hitting on you, but...

315
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:14,651
Just do it.

316
00:16:23,193 --> 00:16:24,969
Now let's go get your woman.

317
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,996
All right, come on.

318
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,023
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

319
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:32,881
I've always wanted to say that.

320
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:35,936
I mean, in a bar.
I say it all the time at home.

321
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:40,539
Someday we should buy a bar.
And when we do,

322
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,645
we are never
going to have last call.

323
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:45,429
Come on, Barney.

324
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:48,359
We said no last call.
We've got to mean it.

325
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:52,238
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Carl's going to be here any minute.

326
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:53,954
Only one thing we can do.

327
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,308
Dude, running a bar
is a pain in the ass.

328
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,658
We should just stick with what we know.

329
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,182
- We should start a band.
- Of course we should start a band!

330
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:08,493
How have we not started a band yet?

331
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:12,062
<i>Kids, sometimes in life</i>

332
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,779
<i>the planets align,
everything links up,</i>

333
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:17,204
<i>and your timing is perfect.</i>

334
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,570
<i>This wasn't one of those times.</i>

335
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:44,453
Where is she?

336
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:45,933
Seattle.

337
00:17:46,602 --> 00:17:47,302
What?

338
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:49,459
Her flight's canceled.
It never took off.

339
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:52,377
She would've called me and...

340
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:57,905
Hey, baby, it's me.

341
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,631
My flight's been canceled
because of some snowstorm

342
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,075
and they couldn't rebook me
till Thursday,

343
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:05,524
<i>so I'm stuck here for another two days.</i>

344
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:08,768
<i>But it's lunchtime,
and I love you.</i>

345
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,994
<i>Like I said, this was
a three-day storm.</i>

346
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,808
I still say this is stupid.

347
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:23,343
<i>So on Tuesday
when Marshall heard that message...</i>

348
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:25,511
She's not coming in till Thursday.

349
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,933
I mean, we came all the way down here,
and she's not coming in till Thursday.

350
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,621
I feel so stupid.

351
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:34,980
Look, let's just, let's not tell Lily
about any of this, okay?

352
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,160
Especially the part
about you hitting on me.

353
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,906
I didn't hit on you.

354
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:40,398
Exactly.

355
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:43,060
<i>Then on Wednesday...</i>

356
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,622
Man. I can't believe
you drove all the way out there.

357
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,257
Now you're just going to turn around

358
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,374
and drive all the way
out there again tomorrow.

359
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:52,181
This whole thing was
a sign, you know?

360
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:55,146
It's time to put that old ritual to bed.
I'm not going to pick her up.

361
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:57,204
Robin really hit on you?

362
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:00,330
It was weird.

363
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:04,080
Bros, this party is awesome!

364
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:06,371
You are true friends
of the Fighting Hens.

365
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:08,218
If you ever need anything,

366
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:09,847
don't hesitate to ask.

367
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:12,199
Is the flute section seeing anyone?

368
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:17,767
So, wait, you're really not going
to pick her up?

369
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:20,346
So the New Year's kiss, the

370
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,722
lunchtime phone calls, the whole

371
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:26,751
"this is what I ate today" thing,
you're, you're really letting it all go?

372
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:29,454
I really am.

373
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,037
<i>Which brings us to Thursday.</i>

374
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,236
A muffin, a pastrami sandwich,
and a bag of chips. And

375
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:20,048
I know it's way past lunchtime,
but I love you.

376
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:23,290
More and more each day,
I love you, Lily.

377
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:24,969
Happy New Year.

378
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:33,902
Does this mean that I have
to bring a marching band

379
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:36,042
- to the airport from now on?
- Absolutely, it does.

380
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:37,121
Crap.

381
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:49,855
Go, Hens!

382
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:54,523
Puzzles.

383
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,310
That is a great band name.

384
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:01,564
Hey, have you seen Amanda?

385
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:03,590
Bingo!
