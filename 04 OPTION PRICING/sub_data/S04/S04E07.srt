1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,210
I am not impressed with
the talent in here tonight.

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,630
And the more I drink,
the less attractive they get.

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:10,384
I'm one scotch and soda away
from the Cantina scene in Star Wars.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,803
What about those girls over there,
they're hot.

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:14,857
- They're not hot.
- Are you kidding?

6
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:18,516
I hated their guts the minute I saw
them, which mean they're hot.

7
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:22,616
In fact, I hated them almost as much
as I hated Robin when I first met her.

8
00:00:22,716 --> 00:00:24,583
- You hated me?
- A lot.

9
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:28,254
Barney, they're hot.

10
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,458
Oh, there is so much to teach you all.

11
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:34,017
You have just become victims of...

12
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:36,869
The Cheerleader Effect.
Glad you asked.

13
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,109
The Cheerleader Effect is when
a group of women seems hot,

14
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:41,828
but only, as a group.

15
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,350
Just like with cheerleaders.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,760
They seem hot,

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,033
but take each one oflthem individually?

18
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,255
Sled dogs.

19
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,632
That's insane.

20
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:54,011
Take a good, hard look at each
one of those girls. Individually.

21
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:13,702
I don't know.

22
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:15,298
The one on the end is kind of cute.

23
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:17,326
Yeah, she really is.

24
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:20,336
And that, my friends, is
The Cheerleader Effect.

25
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:23,154
Also known as
the Bridesmaid Paradox,

26
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,574
Sorority Girl Syndrome,

27
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:26,697
and for a brief window
in the mid-'90s,

28
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:28,692
the Spice Girls Conspiracy.

29
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:30,950
Scary Spice indeed.

30
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:36,522
Barney Stinson.

31
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,042
Oh, hi.

32
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:41,477
Got it.

33
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:44,438
Great, we'll be in touch.

34
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:48,132
What?

35
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:51,068
Apparently I'm gonna be a dad.

36
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:08,411
What do you mean you're gonna be
a dad? How did, how did this happen?

37
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,809
It was just some girl I hooked up with
a few weeks back.

38
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,251
She's not sure. She's gonna go
to the doctor in the morning.

39
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:16,886
Maybe it's a false alarm.
Maybe she's not pregnant.

40
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,989
Lily,

41
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:21,603
no part of Barney Stinson
does anything less than 110%.

42
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:23,666
If one of my little
Michael Phelpses got loose,

43
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,243
he's swimming for the gold.

44
00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:27,105
This is a nightmare.

45
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:28,248
I don't want kids.

46
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,099
Who in their right mind
would ever want kids?

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,720
<i>Now, when you turn 30
and you're in a couple,</i>

48
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,321
<i>a strange thing happens.</i>

49
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:38,128
<i>You start to see
babies everywhere.</i>

50
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:53,243
Oh, come on.

51
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,717
<i>Yes, Marshall and Lily were
coming down with baby fever.</i>

52
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,557
<i>And their new neighbors
weren't helping.</i>

53
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:00,804
Did you lose a sock there,
little dude?

54
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,175
That is without a doubt

55
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,770
the cutest little thing
I've ever seen.

56
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,399
There's my little peanut.

57
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:11,609
<i>That night they sat down to have
a serious practical discussion</i>

58
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:12,820
<i>about having kids.</i>

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,586
So, if we have a baby,

60
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:16,987
do you think you could
work fewer hours?

61
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:21,075
Doesn't matter, he's gonna be so cute,
I'm gonna eat him up on the first day.

62
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:25,829
But what about money?
We're still in a ton of debt.

63
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:29,416
Oh, well, we'll count our overdue
bills on his teeny tiny fingers.

64
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:32,527
Let's have a baby.

65
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:39,593
Oh, oh, right now? Oh, okay.

66
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:42,363
<i>There was just
one thing in their way.</i>

67
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:44,609
Scooch over. I TiVo'd The View.

68
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:50,049
<i>And that thing happened to be
unemployed and sleeping on their couch.</i>

69
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:54,864
So, Robin,

70
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,635
how's the job and
apartment search going?

71
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:58,942
You didn't hear?

72
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,366
I'm the lead anchor on CNN.

73
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:04,360
And I got a penthouse overlooking
Central Park made of gold.

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,620
Get your head out of
your ass, Marshall.

75
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:10,084
<i>They realized if they were
going to start a family</i>

76
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,768
<i>they had to plan ahead.</i>

77
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:15,278
Would you mind crashing
at Ted's tomorrow night?

78
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:18,649
I'm, uh, cooking,
Marshall a special dinner.

79
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:20,640
Just dinner.
That's it. Nothing else.

80
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,252
Fine.

81
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:24,622
But you'd better not be
as uptight as these idiots

82
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,071
about me shooting beer cans
on the roof.

83
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:28,957
"It hurts my ears.

84
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:32,162
The neighbors called the cops.
You almost hit me."

85
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:35,806
Enjoy her, Ted. She's in a real
good place right now.

86
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:40,529
God? It's me.

87
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:41,897
Barney.

88
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:43,002
What up?

89
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:46,160
I know we don't talk much,

90
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:49,551
though a lot of girls call out
your name because of me.

91
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:50,651
Awesome.

92
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:52,436
But, God

93
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,725
if you could get me,
out of this,

94
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:58,101
I swear

95
00:04:58,201 --> 00:04:59,457
I will never

96
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:02,667
ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ev...

97
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,617
Oh, hang on, bro.

98
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,297
Go for Barney.

99
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,516
Really?

100
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:27,231
Marshall, great news!

101
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:28,801
I'm not a father!

102
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,570
Congratulations, buddy.

103
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:33,614
This is the happiest moment
of my life, Marshall.

104
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:36,689
The way I feel
about not having kids?

105
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,962
I never knew I could love
something this much.

106
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,882
That's why
I'm creating a holiday.

107
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:46,387
From now on, today will be known
as "Not a Father's Day."

108
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:48,234
You're creating a holiday?

109
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:50,262
Yeah, why not?
Everyone else gets a day:

110
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,278
Mothers, Fathers, Bastilles.

111
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,897
Why can't there be a day for people
who are single and like it that way?

112
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:59,279
Well, now you just sound like
the chubby girl on Valentine's Day.

113
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,402
- Hello, Stinson.
- Hey, Nolan. How are the kids?

114
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,040
You ready for tonight, Eriksen?
Big merger.

115
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,554
Well, that's between me
and my wife, sir.

116
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,835
No. The meeting with Mr. Li.
Tonight.

117
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,762
I thought that was
a breakfast meeting.

118
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:17,844
It is. Breakfast in China. We're
teleconferencing with the Chinese.

119
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,223
Count on you, kid.

120
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:24,294
Marshall?

121
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:25,353
Hey, babe.

122
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,929
- It's breakfast time in China.
- Yeah, it is.

123
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:31,098
Not a euphemism. Look, I...

124
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,029
- Wait, what would that even mean?
- I don't know,

125
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:37,283
hot buns, spicy pork?
There's something there.

126
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:39,591
You're not coming home tonight,
are you?

127
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:43,645
Are you shaking your head "no?"

128
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:47,174
I thought so.

129
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,735
Oh, thank you, guys,
for coming over so fast.

130
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:53,342
Are you all right?
You sounded upset on the phone.

131
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:56,623
Marshall and I made
this big decision to have

132
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:58,649
dinner.

133
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:01,638
And I thought
I was ready to have

134
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:02,518
dinner.

135
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:04,605
But then he called
and canceled, and

136
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:07,942
it got me thinking.
Is it too early for us to have

137
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,042
dinner?

138
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:11,570
I had an early lunch,
so I'm ready for dinner.

139
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,802
- Dinner is a baby!
- Lily, that's horrible!

140
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,435
No, no, I...

141
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,426
I need you guys to figure
something out for me.

142
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,450
What?

143
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,803
Are Marshall and I ready
to have a baby?

144
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:31,020
So, are Marshall and I ready
to have a baby or not?

145
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,466
Lily, we can't make this decision
for you. It's huge.

146
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:36,500
You know what else is huge?
Marshall's head.

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,087
That thing's the size of a late
August watermelon.

148
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:41,345
Marshall's baby coming
through there?

149
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,815
What does Marshall think?

150
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:49,329
Probably lot in that 1950s space helmet
of a head he's walking around with.

151
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,418
Marshall's really excited.

152
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:54,376
But I think he only sees
what's cute about having a baby,

153
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,038
not what's hard about it.

154
00:07:56,138 --> 00:07:58,885
<i>Like the other day, while Marshall
was playing with baby Jeremy,</i>

155
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:00,599
<i>I was talking to Jeremy's mom.</i>

156
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,285
Thanks so much for inviting us over.

157
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:04,385
I have not talked to another
adult in, like, weeks.

158
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:05,740
Well, besides my husband.

159
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,947
But "It's your turn to change him"
and "Make him shut up"

160
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,879
really doesn't
count as conversation.

161
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:12,336
Sorry, I'm rambling. I haven't
gotten laid in seven months.

162
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:13,780
Oh, I just did it again!

163
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,183
Sleep deprivation!

164
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,835
Oh, wait, I'm not crying, am I?

165
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,050
I usually am.

166
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:21,471
I don't mean to complain.
Oh, now I feel bad!

167
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:24,010
Oh, there's my little peanut!

168
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:26,226
Oh, I love you so much!

169
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:29,261
I'm going to be as
strung out as Charlotte.

170
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:30,749
Worse actually.

171
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:32,818
At least her husband
works from home.

172
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:36,028
I mean, he's a pot dealer,
but he's a very involved parent.

173
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:37,777
Marshall will be a great dad.

174
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:40,001
Marshall's always
at the office, and,

175
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,176
and I'm afraid that if
we have a baby now,

176
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:43,734
all the work will fall on me.

177
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:46,545
You're just panicking and
focusing on the downside.

178
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:48,582
I think Lily's just being realistic.

179
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:52,281
See, this is good. This is why
I called you guys both over here.

180
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,922
Ted, you're pro kids.
Robin, you're against.

181
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:57,049
Counselors, opening statements.

182
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:00,707
Okay, I know you're afraid
that you're not ready.

183
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,527
But no one ever thinks
they're ready.

184
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,107
You just have to take the leap.
Parenthood will come naturally.

185
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:07,102
Well, of course you think
it comes naturally.

186
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:09,144
You're basically a dad already.

187
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:10,520
You're a total dad.

188
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,938
What are you talking about?

189
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:13,531
Ted, think about it.

190
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,493
<i>You tell super corny dad jokes.</i>

191
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:18,732
Shredded tweet!

192
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,364
Oh, man!

193
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,914
Shredded tweet.

194
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:26,896
<i>You lecture us. Like when we broke
your stupid ship in a bottle.</i>

195
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:29,373
I'm not angry.
I'm just disappointed.

196
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:32,255
- She did it!
- Shut up!

197
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:37,185
<i>And you do that thing
all dads do with waitresses.</i>

198
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,795
Hi, I'm Lori.
I'll be your waitress this evening.

199
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:43,178
Hi, Lori, I'm Ted.
I'll be your customer this evening.

200
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,526
Hey, Lori,
before you go, tell me,

201
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,141
what do you get when you cross
a canary with a lawn mower?

202
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:49,518
No hints. No hints.

203
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:53,452
She's right. Ted, you maybe
single and childless,

204
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,571
but you're totally a dorky dad.

205
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:59,215
I don't think I like
your tone, young lady.

206
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:03,202
Marshall,
Not a Father's Day is a hit!

207
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,583
Laraby and Finklestein are
helping me celebrate. Check it.

208
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,578
"World's Greatest Not A Dad" mugs.

209
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:11,906
There's, uh... ha!
"Who's Not Your Daddy?" Tee-shirts.

210
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:14,710
Both available at
Not A Father's Day.Com.

211
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,191
Oh, check out the greeting cards.

212
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,483
"For everything you do for yourself,

213
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,183
For all the scotch upon your shelf,

214
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:28,401
Your Porsche Carrera rules the freeway,
Here's wishing you

215
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,580
"an all night three-way.
Happy Not a Father's Day."

216
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:33,802
Check out the illustration.

217
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:40,346
It appears to be
some sort of Asian hooker.

218
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:43,075
Yes.
Because on Not a Father's Day,

219
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,202
you get a Thai you'd actually wear.
Wordplay five!

220
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:50,525
She's really kicking
your ass here, Mosby.

221
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,689
Your only hope
is to go negative.

222
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:53,789
Okay.

223
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,798
I'll tell you why my opponent
is saying all this.

224
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:57,966
Three words,

225
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:01,492
- scared of babies.
- What?

226
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:04,176
- That is crazy. I am not.
- Oh, yeah?

227
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,428
<i>Remember that time you met
my cousin and her kid?</i>

228
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,019
She is so cute!

229
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,087
Oh, do you want to hold her?

230
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,443
<i>Or the baby shower Lily threw
for her friend Erika?</i>

231
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,359
Are you leing
that baby sniff you?

232
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:24,007
I don't want to get bitten.

233
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,043
<i>And don't forget about...</i>

234
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:34,456
- Talking baby commercial?
- Talking baby commercial.

235
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:38,131
But you're not like that, Lily.
You love kids and they love you.

236
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:41,917
Yes, I'm loveable,
pretty and wise, but is it enough?

237
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:45,091
Look, it all comes down
to one word, you.

238
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,030
Are you ready to put your own
dreams on the back burner?

239
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,622
Grad school,
teaching art at the college level?

240
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:53,537
Look, you need to focus
on Project Lily before

241
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:55,192
you can start Project Baby.

242
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,260
If you don't,
you'll always regret it.

243
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,065
And that wouldn't be fair to you
or the baby.

244
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:02,807
What's that?

245
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,780
It's Jeremy's sock.

246
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,116
I'm having a baby.

247
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,999
But what about all the things
I just said?

248
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,954
But, but sock.

249
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:16,610
But what about Marshall
working all the time?

250
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,083
But sock.

251
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:19,782
But Project Lily!

252
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,462
Little fishies on it.

253
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,132
We made all of these arguments,
and a sock

254
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,697
is what makes your
decision for you?

255
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:30,985
I guess that was the sock-out punch,
huh, Robin?

256
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:34,021
- Shut up, Dad.
- You shut up, baby hater.

257
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,219
Babies are scary, okay?
They have giant eyes.

258
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,241
And then, come on, the soft spot?

259
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,461
If there's gonna be
a self-destruct button,

260
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,853
at least hide it somewhere
it won't accidentally get pressed.

261
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,133
Where's Lily?

262
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:51,935
- Hey, did you drink any of this?
- Not a drop.

263
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,072
Me, neither.

264
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:57,555
Eriksen, meeting in five minutes.

265
00:12:57,655 --> 00:13:00,242
And you'd better bring
your A-game for Mr. Li.

266
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:02,496
That guy haunts my nightmares.

267
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:04,558
Anyway, have fun out there, kid.

268
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:10,339
Put a baby in me, Marshall.

269
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:11,439
I'm ready.

270
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:20,409
Lily... Lily,
what are you doing here?

271
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,953
I'm ready, Marshall.
Tonight's the night.

272
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:26,540
Put your melon-headed spawn
in my belly.

273
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,753
- What?
- Yeah!

274
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:30,272
Come on, right now.
Baby me. I'm ready.

275
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,579
Hey, look.

276
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,429
The guys in the next building
are waving at me.

277
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:37,550
Hello, gentlemen!

278
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,554
We're going to make a baby!

279
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,468
I can't believe we lost her.

280
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:45,600
See, this is exactly why
I'm never having kids.

281
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,860
You can't let them out of your sight
for even a second.

282
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:49,599
I can't find my file.

283
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,410
I pulled out "A" through "G."

284
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,913
Ag! Aaaaggg.

285
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,245
They just sit there with
their stupid bottles.

286
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:03,245
They cry.

287
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:13,500
They spit up.

288
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:19,124
And that's why kids suck.

289
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:20,948
It is a good thing we broke up.

290
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:23,476
I forgot how totally psycho
you are on the kids thing.

291
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:24,653
I'm psycho?

292
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:27,393
Any time you even hear
the word "kids,"

293
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:30,323
you get two little lactation stains
on your shirt.

294
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,342
Thank God you're not a mom.
You are such an ice queen.

295
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:35,786
Any baby nursing from you
would get brain freeze.

296
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:39,859
Look, don't paint me as some sort of a
freak for wanting to remain independent.

297
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,788
There are plenty of normal people out
there who don't want to have kids.

298
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:46,798
Brother, lay your hand on this
box of condoms and repeat after me.

299
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:49,258
I, state the fake name
you give to women.

300
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,969
I, Johnny Banana.

301
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:55,685
Vow to always choose
wet T-shirts over wet diapers.

302
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,419
- Vow to always...
- Yeah, you're in great company there.

303
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,054
I'm gonna look for Lily
in the bathroom.

304
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:03,940
While I'm in there,
I'll grab you a tampon.

305
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,171
Great, and when you're done
shaking off at the urinal,

306
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:08,511
maybe you could ask
the wizard to give you a heart.

307
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:11,817
You know what? Maybe I should find
somewhere else to stay this weekend.

308
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,255
- No argument here.
- Fine.

309
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:14,355
Great.

310
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:17,418
Welcome, to our fraternity
of non-paternity.

311
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:20,230
He is one of us.

312
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:24,488
Gentlemen,

313
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
Mr. Li,

314
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:28,073
if you would all please
open to page five

315
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,434
of your merger documents.

316
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,175
I think that you...

317
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:36,520
What is it, Eriksen?

318
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,735
Nothing.

319
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:40,594
I just think that you look

320
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:41,948
very nice today.

321
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,049
What are you looking at?

322
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:57,562
I am looking at the future

323
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,741
of our two companies, and

324
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,396
it looks very

325
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,366
naked.

326
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:07,965
Would you excuse me
just for a brief second?

327
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,093
Did anyone else see the drunk chick?

328
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:17,609
Hey, you guys didn't have to...

329
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:20,576
It's a picture of me with no kids.

330
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:22,995
And there's macaroni glued
on the frame.

331
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:24,254
Guys, I love it.

332
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:27,069
Well, Lily's not in there.

333
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,921
Your phone rang. I answered it.
I hope you don't mind.

334
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,531
- Marshall's got Lily. She's fine.
- Oh, thank God.

335
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:35,792
What?

336
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:38,718
When I was putting
your phone back, and...

337
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,054
- I found something in your bag.
- I have a permit for that.

338
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:43,576
- And the other thing was a gift.
- No.

339
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:45,401
This.

340
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:48,842
You stole Jeremy's sock.

341
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,123
No, I didn't.

342
00:16:50,223 --> 00:16:54,256
I don't know how that got in there.
It must've fallen in. Weird!

343
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:57,491
- "Fallen in"?
- Or Lily put it in there as a joke.

344
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,400
That bitch be drunk.

345
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:02,274
Okay, I took it.

346
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:04,719
It's just,

347
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,433
so cute.

348
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:08,229
Sock.

349
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:13,036
Robin Scherbatsky, are you warming
to the idea of having children?

350
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:14,288
No.

351
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,071
I don't know.

352
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:17,888
Maybe someday.

353
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,077
When I'm, like, 70.
Science will catch up.

354
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:23,543
Look, I'm just...

355
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:27,879
I'm confused lately. I'm unemployed.
I'm living on a couch.

356
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:29,192
Yeah.

357
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:32,463
It's been a rough couple
of months for both of us.

358
00:17:34,273 --> 00:17:36,042
Hey, I have a spare bedroom.

359
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:38,853
Why don't you stay with me while you
look for a place?

360
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:40,213
- Really?
- Yeah.

361
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:45,072
Thanks, Ted. I already have some leads,
so it'll be one week, two weeks tops.

362
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,928
<i>And that's how your Aunt Robin
moved in with me.</i>

363
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:53,155
I'm bored. Let's go dancing.

364
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:57,427
- Let's rob a liquor store!
- Lily, we're not going anywhere, okay?

365
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,661
Whenever we go somewhere
when you're drunk,

366
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:01,128
you always fall asleep as soon
as we get in the...

367
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:04,655
We're going dancing!

368
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:07,498
We're gonna party
all night long!

369
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,571
Can you circle the block
a couple times

370
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,758
just to make sure
she's really down?

371
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:16,909
Sure thing.

372
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:21,052
Latest Not A Father's Day brainstorm,

373
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:22,691
a pregnancy test,

374
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,484
but instead of
a little blue line,

375
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,754
there's a little, blue Barney
going like this.

376
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:31,729
Barney, Not A Father's Day is lame.
It's a holiday for losers.

377
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:33,509
What are you...?
What're you talking about?

378
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:35,282
That's a great group of bros.

379
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,445
Barney, it's the Cheerleader Effect.

380
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:40,196
No, Ted. That only works for chicks.

381
00:18:40,296 --> 00:18:43,683
Take a good look at each one
of those guys individually.

382
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:03,346
These geniuses are not childless
by choice, my friend.

383
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:05,809
- Good night, Barney.
- Good night.

384
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:15,086
Sock.

385
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:21,926
Do I smell chocolate chip pancakes?

386
00:19:22,008 --> 00:19:24,309
You smell "Chocolate chip"

387
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:27,685
"I'm sorry I was such a drunk
idiot" pancakes.

388
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:29,945
Is there any "Wish I hadn't
puked on your shirt" bacon?

389
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:31,473
There sure is.

390
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:32,894
Baby...

391
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,396
I'm so sorry about last night.
I know I was a mess. I...

392
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:41,463
I just started freaking out about
whether we're ready to be parents.

393
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:44,659
But you took such good care of me.

394
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,513
I know you're gonna be a great dad.

395
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:48,487
I don't want to be a dad right now.

396
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,583
What?

397
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:51,703
Last night, it was just...

398
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:54,776
Between balancing work
and drunk Baby Lily,

399
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:56,273
it was too much.

400
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,642
I'm just getting
started at this job,

401
00:19:58,742 --> 00:20:01,120
and I'm working
such long hours, I mean...

402
00:20:01,578 --> 00:20:02,778
Look, I love you.

403
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:06,627
And I absolutely want to
have kids someday. I just...

404
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,577
I want to be ready for it.

405
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:11,329
Me, too.

406
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:14,247
And whenever we are ready,

407
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,740
I know you're going
to be amazing.

408
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,130
You, too.

409
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:26,972
Do you want to go have completely
protected sex right now?

410
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:28,248
I do.

411
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:30,378
Do you want to finish
your bacon first?

412
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,449
You are the perfect woman.

413
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:45,324
<i>And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon.</i>

414
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:48,089
<i>Little Boy Blue and
the Man on the Moon.</i>

415
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:51,638
<i>- When you comin' home, Dad?
- I don't know when.</i>

416
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:54,597
<i>We'll get together then, son</i>

417
00:20:54,697 --> 00:20:58,314
<i>I'll know we'll have
a good time then.</i>
