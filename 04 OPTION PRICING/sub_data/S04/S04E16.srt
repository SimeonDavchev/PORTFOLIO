1
00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:04,880
<i>Back in 2009, your Aunt Robin got
a job hosting a morning show.</i>

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:07,160
<i>Which meant she had
to get up kind of early.</i>

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,272
<i>How early?</i>

4
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:11,573
'Morning everybody.

5
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,118
So you actually doing it?

6
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:17,517
You're actually going to work
at 2:00 a.m.?

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:20,312
I'm not doing it for me,
I'm doing it for the fans.

8
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:23,649
Who exactly are the fans of a show
that airs at 4:00 in the morning?

9
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,088
People getting up to host a show
at 5:00 in the morning.

10
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:29,783
Meth addicts who haven't sold
their TVs yet?

11
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:31,803
Strippers in that
messy gray area between

12
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:34,585
getting off work and
getting their kids up for school?

13
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:36,023
Them's my peeps.

14
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,300
All right, catch me up.
What's been going on?

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,563
You know...

16
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:40,663
The yoozh.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,626
Really, the yoozh?

18
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,921
Think of the funniest thing
that has ever happened.

19
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:48,683
- Got it.
- Now double that.

20
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:51,944
So, a chimpanzee wearing
two texudos.

21
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:56,973
Something even funnier than that
happen's to Marshall today.

22
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,438
Okay, first of all,
there's nothing funnier than that.

23
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:01,309
Second of all, look it's...

24
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,146
It's not that good a story.

25
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,572
Come on, you guys,

26
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:08,777
you're four young active people living
in the most exciting city on earth.

27
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,930
You're telling me you have
no stories for me?

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,080
What can I say?
Some weeks are just like that.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,468
It's the same thing over and over.

30
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:17,577
A kid in my class ate some paste.

31
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:21,832
I used deceitful means to hook up
with a less-than-intelligent girl.

32
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,765
My ex-gilfriend Karen moved to town,
it's just all the same Robin.

33
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,433
Karen's in town?

34
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:29,690
- Oh noooo!
- You have got to be kidding me!

35
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,758
<i>Kids, I think I've
told you about Karen.</i>

36
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:35,858
<i>She was my girlfriend in high-school,
and intermittently through college.</i>

37
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,936
<i>She was beautiful, smart.</i>

38
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:39,584
<i>I was madly in love with her.</i>

39
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:41,215
<i>The only problem was,</i>

40
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:43,133
<i>Marshall and Lily were not.</i>

41
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:46,329
<i>I think it had something to do
were every time Karen opened her mouth.</i>

42
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:48,399
I love taht you guys live in a dorm.

43
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:49,794
It's so American.

44
00:01:50,274 --> 00:01:53,231
It's like let's all eat baloney
sandiwches and be racist.

45
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,731
Oh my God. She was such a douche.

46
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:00,907
Dude, she was the heiress
of the Massengill fortune.

47
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:02,815
She really wasn't that bad.

48
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:06,120
Of course, you think that
she turned you into one of

49
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,364
her douche zombies.

50
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,568
I want to eat your brain

51
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:13,238
but only if it's organic
and grass-fed.

52
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:15,641
What?

53
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:17,603
Will you pass the salt?

54
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,064
Salt?

55
00:02:20,063 --> 00:02:21,308
So bourgeois.

56
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,602
Totally.

57
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:28,148
What's that thing?

58
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:30,942
That's... a TV, Karen.

59
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,343
I don't watch TV.

60
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:36,628
Totally.

61
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,856
You thought I actually bought
tickets to Wrestle Mania?

62
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:43,148
I was being ironic.

63
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,062
Totally.

64
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:46,742
I know

65
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,211
that you were being ironic.

66
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:52,368
I too...

67
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,406
I'm being ironic.

68
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,332
Let's do this.

69
00:02:58,975 --> 00:02:59,975
What?

70
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:02,630
That make up didn't
come off for a month.

71
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,894
I had to meet Lily's parents that way.
I've never looked like a bigger jackass.

72
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,148
Until today, tell the story...

73
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:10,644
Just let it go.

74
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:13,065
Well, hold on.
Is it really funny?

75
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:15,572
I am not kidding you.

76
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:18,717
I almost don't want you to hear it,
because seriously,

77
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:20,994
for the rest of your life,

78
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,230
nothing else will ever be as funny
and you

79
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,707
will curse yourself for agreeing
to ever hear it in the first place.

80
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:31,067
But seriously, you got to hear it,
it's so funny.

81
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:33,085
Fine.

82
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:36,842
I was at the compagny gym this
morning, playing basketball, and

83
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:40,305
the guys I work with can be
pretty brutal with their ridicule.

84
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:42,309
Look at Wisniewski.

85
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:43,877
He's gonna cry, look at him.

86
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:48,518
I don't know. I don't think knees aren't
supposed to bend that way, I think

87
00:03:48,638 --> 00:03:50,078
he might have tore his ACL.

88
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:53,296
The only thing that guy tore was
his cervix or maybe his hymen.

89
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,327
Yeah, or his fallopian tube.

90
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,757
I may have cleaned up
the dialogue a little bit.

91
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:01,857
Anyways...

92
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:04,719
I go to my duffle bag
to get out my work clothes.

93
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:05,819
Wait, wait!

94
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,531
I want to say it...

95
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:09,208
Fine, you say it.

96
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:13,129
Marshall goes to his duffle bag
to get out his work clothes

97
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:15,755
and... No, no, no, you say it.
It's funnier if you say it.

98
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,208
No, let me say it!

99
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,760
No, you say it.
You say it. Say it.

100
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,913
Same time!

101
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,408
No, no, no. You go, you go!

102
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,920
- I forgot...
- Marshall forgot his pants!

103
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:39,740
He forgot his pants.

104
00:04:57,994 --> 00:05:00,521
Marshhal forget his pants,
That's pretty funny.

105
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:03,187
It's not a chimpanzee
wearing two tuxedos.

106
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,176
What? Did he...
forgot he put the first one on?

107
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,099
Stupid monkey!

108
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:14,360
So Karen in New York,
weird, right?

109
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:17,093
Ted, you cannot get back together
with Karen.

110
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,461
I nerver said I was going to get back
together with her.

111
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,423
I was thinking

112
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:23,635
she's new in town, would it be the worst
thing in the world if I gave her a call?

113
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,453
It wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world,

114
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,056
it would be the fourth worst thing.

115
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:29,984
Number 1, Super volcano.
Number 2, an astroid hits the Earth.

116
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:32,234
Number 3,
all footage of Evel Knievel is lost.

117
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,470
Number 4, Ted calls Karen.

118
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,464
Number 5,
Lily gets eaten by a shark.

119
00:05:36,564 --> 00:05:39,032
I'm Lily and I approve
the order of that list.

120
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,731
You don't know the whole story.

121
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,135
Ted and Karen were off and on
all through college,

122
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:46,485
and it always went the same way.

123
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:49,334
They'd be having fun,
douching it up, and then one day...

124
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:53,805
I know you think pepperoni is fascist
and you're totally right, so I can...

125
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:56,215
Oh, my God! Karen!

126
00:05:57,602 --> 00:05:58,602
Sorry, bro.

127
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:01,338
Before you say anything,

128
00:06:01,438 --> 00:06:03,187
I think that you should read.

129
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:05,433
Baudelaire's, "Les Fleurs Du Mal".

130
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:12,986
So then they break up,
He would be all depressed, and

131
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:14,912
we would wait
the appropriate amount of time

132
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:17,151
and then we'd would tell him
how we really felt.

133
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,552
- Karen and I broke up.
- We hated her!

134
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:20,968
Bitch had to go!

135
00:06:22,076 --> 00:06:24,192
And then Ted would build up
a head of steam

136
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:28,623
and finally take the bus to Providence
to give Karen a piece of his mind.

137
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:30,939
How did it go?

138
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,039
Great.

139
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:34,199
Look who's back?

140
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:42,553
And then sure enough, the whole
thing would start all over again.

141
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:48,457
Make that 10000 and 2 Maniacs, because
I got us Natalie Merchant tick...

142
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:51,136
Sorry, bro.

143
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,549
So she would come visit you at school
and the second you turned your back

144
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,161
she would bring guys
back to your dorm room?

145
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,261
Respect.

146
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:01,197
I was an idiot.

147
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:03,975
She was my first real girlfriend,
She was madly in love with her.

148
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:06,581
We all did stuff we regret,
in college.

149
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:09,154
Junior year,
Marshall grew a soul patch,

150
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,250
wore a rasta hat, and asked
everyone to call him M.J. Smooth.

151
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:14,592
I don't regret that for one second.

152
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:18,107
So you guys, absolutely
don't think I should call her?

153
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:20,555
- Ted, no!
- What's wrong with you?

154
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:21,972
Fine I won't.

155
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:24,826
Interristing piece of trivia,

156
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,755
- I called her.
- What are you doing?

157
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:28,182
It's the pants story.

158
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,386
I can't believe you called her.

159
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:32,851
Why don't you just ask her
to lunch while you're at it?

160
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:36,456
Because, Lily, I'm not gonna
ask her out to lunch

161
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:37,968
again.

162
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:40,832
You asked her to lunch?

163
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:44,071
Why would anyone,
want to have a lunch,

164
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,307
- with their ex.
- Glad you asked, Marshall.

165
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:48,854
There are four possible motives
behind an ex lunch.

166
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:51,247
Number 1, they want to
get back together.

167
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,916
Like my high school
boyfriend Scooter.

168
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:56,643
Lilies, clever.

169
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,464
I'm sorry I don't have
a scooter for you.

170
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,134
My God, that's funny.

171
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,135
I forgot how funny you are.

172
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:07,513
- Where is the waiter?
- Why?

173
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,122
You like waiters?

174
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:10,544
I can be a waiter.

175
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:15,021
I'm going to be the greatest waiter
on this earth, and then you'll love me.

176
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,842
Number 2, they want to kill you.

177
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,076
Like when I had lunch with Wendy.

178
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:23,071
I'm glad we could finally do this.

179
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:25,808
You know, after that ninth time
you rescheduled on me?

180
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:27,351
I almost gave up on you.

181
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:28,566
But you didn't.

182
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,724
You just kept on trying.

183
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,716
By the way

184
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,890
there's something
I've been meaning to give you.

185
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:40,707
Gun! She's got a gun!

186
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,926
It's a tie.

187
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:48,864
Number 3, they actually do
want to give you your stuff back.

188
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,598
Like when I had lunch with Curt.

189
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:53,909
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to give you?

190
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:02,166
My snub-nosed. 38 police special.

191
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:04,260
I knew I left that somewhere.

192
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:08,574
Every time I watch the news, I'm like,
"Hope that wasn't my gun."

193
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:11,994
Breaking up was the right choice.

194
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:17,416
Or number 4, to rub your face
in how great they're doing.

195
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:19,961
Like my lunch with Nicole Barsamian.

196
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:22,421
- Who's Nicole Barsamian?
- My ex.

197
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:24,757
Hello Nicole.

198
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,842
You look well, Marshall.

199
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,344
You look okay, I guess.

200
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:31,817
- I'm seing someone.
- Already?

201
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:32,917
Who?

202
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:35,705
Lee Roberts.
He reads at a fifth grade level.

203
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,941
You have to cancel the lunch.

204
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:44,069
I would definitetly do that,
definitetly.

205
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:46,077
Except I already had it.

206
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:50,759
I'm going to need to borrow
the butt of your gun.

207
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,766
I actually lost it again.
Can you believe that?

208
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,168
How could you break bread
with that woman?

209
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,310
It was just lunch.
And you know she doesn't eat wheat.

210
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:07,595
We had great time, catching up.

211
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:10,635
We even laughed about
what jerks we were back then.

212
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:14,624
I can't believe I had a beret
for each day of the week.

213
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:18,601
I can't believe I had an iron-on
image of Molière on my backpack.

214
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:21,813
Man, we were pretentious.

215
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,314
So pretentious.

216
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:25,748
What can I get you?

217
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,818
I don't want to cause a scene

218
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,263
but your wine list has
a Châteauneuf du Pape

219
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:35,368
listed under the Côte de Provence.

220
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,370
You might want to alert your sommelier.

221
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:39,974
And, for you?

222
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,993
I hate to go off-menu but,
can you bring us some

223
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:46,045
brochette with
fresh mozzarella? Grazie.

224
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,105
It was great. It was great.

225
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:52,635
There was one, weird moment,
towards the end.

226
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:55,109
How do you say good-bye
in those situations?

227
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,384
A kiss on the cheek is too familiar,
a handshake is too formal...

228
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:01,445
A hug is just like
a public dry hump.

229
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:04,230
I think you're hugging wrong.

230
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:07,192
- So what happenned?
- Well...

231
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,772
Schopenhauer made
a saucy little argument,

232
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,246
in which, he pos...

233
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,438
Ted, honey, I want you to go outside and
bite the curb. I'll be out in a minute.

234
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:19,746
Karen, was the first girl
I ever loved.

235
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:22,560
Okay? And, after the year I've had,

236
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,870
I don't know, I guess,
having lunch with her just

237
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,796
remind me of what it was like to be 18
and have my whole life figured out.

238
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:30,784
And I would like to remind everyone,

239
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:33,635
that at least,
I was wearing pants, Marshall!

240
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:37,639
You can't just go changing
the subject like that!

241
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:39,140
The pants story.

242
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,768
Pants story bomaye!
Pants story bomaye!

243
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:45,245
There is no story!
I had a little situation

244
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:47,688
- so I called Lily.
- Refresh us,

245
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:50,041
- what was that situation?
- I forgot my pants.

246
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,115
What do you mean,
you forgot your pants?

247
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,623
I forgot them.

248
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:56,511
I need you to bring me some.

249
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:58,298
What about your spare pants?

250
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:00,242
Last thursday, the mustard incident?

251
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:02,497
Jeez, woman, you have
the memory of a goldfish!

252
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,270
You're not getting off that easy!

253
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,210
Marshall's pants story,
while amusing...

254
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,816
Amusing? Try... Very amusing.

255
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:14,092
Is nothing compared to this
Karen madness. Finish your story.

256
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,678
Taht's it! It was just
one kiss in the restaurant.

257
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,596
Why did you say "in the restaurant"?

258
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:21,349
Did you kiss somewhere else?

259
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:22,661
Like where?

260
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:23,761
In a tree?

261
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,484
Lily, we did not make out in a tree!

262
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:28,122
What's with this one?

263
00:12:30,676 --> 00:12:31,960
What did you do?

264
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,156
Ted, how could you?

265
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:44,099
Marshall forgot to bring
his pants to work today

266
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:46,624
and you're still the stupidest person
at this table.

267
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:49,010
Okay, Lily, let's be honest.

268
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,998
We both know
your real motivation here,

269
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,503
you hate Karen,

270
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:54,299
because, she lingered.

271
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,175
You son of a bitch!

272
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:58,245
What do you mean, she lingered?

273
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:01,115
February 5, 1998.

274
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,348
I was painting.

275
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:06,274
Sorry, I...

276
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:08,431
Sorry... I...

277
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:14,109
You know...

278
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:17,264
Thaht color palette is a bit
derivative of early Van Gogh,

279
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,560
don't you think?

280
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:25,912
Cheat on Ted, criticize my painting,
whatever that's your business.

281
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:27,503
But I catch you,

282
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,300
peeping on my man's junk,
and you linger!

283
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,793
You gots to get got!

284
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:36,383
The game is the game.

285
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:39,676
In Karen's defense,
I had just worked out.

286
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:42,851
Why did you have to paint
Marshall nude anyway?

287
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:44,887
Because he ate my bowl of fruit.

288
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:47,178
But the point is, Karen,

289
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:48,908
is a dirty linger

290
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,564
and you cannot bring
her back into our lives!

291
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:54,004
Relax! It was just that one night!

292
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:56,235
And the next three after that.
And one morning.

293
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,655
But at least,
I had pants on, Marshall.

294
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:01,449
Although, actually, I didn't.

295
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:03,743
Wait. This happen in our appartment?

296
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:04,911
Where was I?

297
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:06,597
You know, those sleeping pills you're

298
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:08,477
taking to keep on
your crazy new schedule?

299
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:10,630
I think they're stronger
than you realize.

300
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,894
La Fontaine gets
the puck to Turgeon.

301
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,561
Turgeon shoots.

302
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,397
Glove save!

303
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,453
Hey, Ted. Hey, Lily.

304
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:29,390
Don't worry, I won't tell Marshall.

305
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:33,011
I'm gonna grab a beer, you want one?

306
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,450
Beer!

307
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:41,345
I'll start decanting the Bordeaux.

308
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,353
Sure it's fun to look back at a time

309
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:53,292
when you were a fresh-faced
farm girl with a virgin's glow.

310
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:57,434
But all that stuff,
Ohio, Karen, college?

311
00:14:57,534 --> 00:14:59,086
All that was B.S.

312
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:00,591
Before Stinson.

313
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:03,969
Now, your life is awesome!
I mean, yeah,

314
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,237
you still live with your ex-girlfriend
which is ridiculous.

315
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:10,167
Your Laser Tag chops
are almost nonexistent.

316
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:11,856
And your wardrobe!

317
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:13,152
It's like

318
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:17,237
what, are you allergic to quality
fabrics? Seriously Ted, shape up!

319
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:21,217
What were we talking about?

320
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:23,274
So what's next with this broad?

321
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:25,781
Please, the story is already written.

322
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,683
Ted is Charlie Brown,
trying to kick the football

323
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:32,665
and Karen's Lucy, who pulls it away at
the last second and has sex with it.

324
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:35,668
You guys know what I mean.

325
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,549
Ted's gonna fall in love and then
Karen's gonna cheat on him

326
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,497
with some meathead who's like.

327
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,563
Sorry, bro.

328
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:46,065
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

329
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:48,485
You must have left the right answer
in your pants Marshall,

330
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,329
cause that's exactly
what didn't happen.

331
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:51,910
<i>You guys, here' what happenned.</i>

332
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,233
<i>One afternoon,
we were at Karen's place...</i>

333
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:57,988
Oh, my God!

334
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,063
How could you?

335
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:04,711
Sorry, bro.

336
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:12,924
<i>So this time, the meathead
Karen was cheating with...</i>

337
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:14,092
Was me.

338
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:16,604
Me.

339
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:20,348
Remember that time
Marshall forgot his pants?

340
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,910
You quit trying to change the subject.
You crossed the line.

341
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,059
You are complicit in breaking
some poor guy's heart. And you,

342
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:31,958
you of all people know
exactly how that feels.

343
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,456
You really don't want to tell
the pants story?

344
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,228
- What?
- Pants, pants...

345
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:38,991
Fine!

346
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:43,002
Lily came down to the office
to bring me my pants...

347
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:46,006
- Why did she have to do that?
- Because I forgot my pants.

348
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,161
What are you doing here?

349
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:51,087
I'm here to give Marshall something.

350
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:55,578
Here to give him something.
Gotcha. Nice.

351
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,636
But I'm in a hurry.
Can I just give it to you?

352
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,295
Sure.

353
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,769
And then you'll give it to him?

354
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:08,108
Wait. I don't know about all that.

355
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,373
I mean,
yours would have to be really good.

356
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:15,223
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

357
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:19,074
Marshall forgot his pants,
so I'm bringing him a new pair.

358
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:22,478
Marshall forgot his pants.

359
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:25,683
It's a good thing that you came by
because he has a really

360
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:29,257
important meeting today,
and it would be pretty embarrassing

361
00:17:29,535 --> 00:17:33,997
and not at all funny if he were
to show up not wearing pants.

362
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:37,834
- I'll make sure he gets these.
- Great. Thanks.

363
00:17:39,747 --> 00:17:41,752
And you didn't give him his pants.

364
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:48,417
Of course I gave him his pants.
I gave Lily my word. My word is oak.

365
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:52,117
Though I did make some alterations.

366
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,847
Now, as you'll see on page 44
of the contract...

367
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,827
When did you join AC/DC?

368
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:10,939
Now, can we please just turn
to page 44 of the contract.

369
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,974
I think the Oliver Twist auditions
are down the hall!

370
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:22,426
Please, sir, may I have some more...
pants?

371
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:32,272
More pan...

372
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,982
That's it? That's the whole story?

373
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,885
- So what happened with Karen?
- I'll finish it for you.

374
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:48,405
Ted left without saying anything and
Karen got exactly what she wanted.

375
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:50,927
Not this time.

376
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,512
You have a boyfriend?

377
00:18:53,703 --> 00:18:55,591
We've been drifting
apart for a long time.

378
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:57,962
I've been meaning to
break up with him.

379
00:18:58,223 --> 00:18:59,674
You are unbelievable.

380
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,107
You don't have the guts

381
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,235
to break up with someone
like a decent human being,

382
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:04,804
so instead you pull this crap.

383
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:08,751
You're right.

384
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,451
I'm great with books.

385
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,392
I'm great with art.

386
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:16,344
I'm great with
identifying French wines

387
00:19:16,464 --> 00:19:19,454
from within a mile of where
the grapes are grown. But...

388
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:22,811
I'm really bad when it comes
to looking someone in the eye

389
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:25,396
and telling them the truth
about how I feel.

390
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,658
We're both bad at that. But...

391
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:32,299
I think we both need to change. So,
why don't I go first?

392
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,875
You're a really hurtful
and reckless person, and

393
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:39,577
I never want to see you
or speak to you again.

394
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:41,979
Au revoir.

395
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Wait.

396
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,143
Actually,

397
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:52,310
"au revoir"means "until
we see each other again".

398
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:55,176
So, I'm assuming that you mean

399
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:56,805
we will in fact

400
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,555
see each other again?

401
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:02,598
Sorry, bro.

402
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,343
I am impressed with you.

403
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,235
You, too, Marshall.
Have you been wearing those all day?

404
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:13,982
They show off my calves.

405
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:16,706
Pants story. Tell it again.

406
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,047
Maybe it was good you called Karen.

407
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:24,224
It definitely was.
And not just for me, but for her, too.

408
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:26,238
Later that night,
she sat down with Jerry,

409
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,888
and she had the break-up talk
she always avoided with me.

410
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,560
<i>So you see, kids,</i>

411
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,344
<i>sometimes when you have
to have a tough conversation,</i>

412
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:34,985
<i>the best thing to do...</i>

413
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:36,452
Wait

414
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:37,596
a second.

415
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,206
You said you were never gonna talk
to Karen again, right?

416
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:44,901
Then how do you know
she took your advice?

417
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:49,619
Well, about that...

418
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:52,671
After she broke up with that dude, she
called me, we went out, we hooked up,

419
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:55,210
we've been dating ever since.
We're really seeing eye to eye,

420
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,644
it just feels different somehow.
Here she comes now. Be cool!
