1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,167
<i>Kids, Stella Zinman was the girl.</i>

2
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:05,984
<i>I thought I'd spend
the rest of my life with.</i>

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:09,554
<i>Until she left me at the altar,
smashing my heart to smithereens.</i>

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,957
<i>So when I ran into her
seven months later,</i>

5
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:14,158
<i>there was only one way
to deal with her.</i>

6
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:18,454
- Great to see you!
- You, too.

7
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:20,191
And Tony!

8
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:23,501
What a nice surprise.

9
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:25,112
"What a nice surprise"?

10
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:26,902
No, a nice surprise would be

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,056
if a safe fell from 40 stories
and smushed them both.

12
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,634
You didn't let them have it?

13
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:35,179
No, we had a nice friendly chat, then,
they went their way and I went mine.

14
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:37,447
You blew it. He blew it, right?

15
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:41,644
- Well played, sir.
- Bravo.

16
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:43,020
- What?
- You see,

17
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:46,665
Ted played it cool, which is exactly
what he should have done.

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,443
As a matter of fact,
I'd say on a scale ranging from...

19
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:51,362
And I kept this sweater of yours,

20
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,758
and sometimes
I just sit in the bathtub

21
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:58,200
for hours just,
you know, just sniffing it.

22
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,079
all the way to...

23
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:01,897
This is my new fiancée.

24
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:03,332
She's basically Stella,

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,932
except she's French
and, as you can see,

26
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,757
she's got enormous cans.

27
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,109
<i>Enchantée.</i>

28
00:01:11,628 --> 00:01:12,628
<i>Enchanté.</i>

29
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:19,223
I'd say you nailed it.

30
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:20,922
I'll do you one better.

31
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,977
You, sir, got Stella thinking.

32
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:26,981
"Gosh, Ted seemed so cool today.
Did I choose the wrong guy?"

33
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:29,775
Give it a week, you'll get her back.

34
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:31,566
And her front.

35
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:35,656
Did you just feel that?
I think we just had a "what up" quake.

36
00:01:37,637 --> 00:01:39,237
I don't want her back.

37
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,383
Or her front.
I just want to move on.

38
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:43,462
And this was an important step
towards that.

39
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:44,910
To moving on.

40
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:47,775
<i>And you know, I really meant it.</i>

41
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:51,224
<i>But still, that night,
my mind began to wander.</i>

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,677
I made a terrible mistake.

43
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:59,263
I know.
I'm a better person than you are.

44
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:00,764
You totally are.

45
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,808
Let's get back together,
and have way more sex.

46
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:03,976
Deal!

47
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,180
Hello, Ted.

48
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:32,868
No, come in. It's not weird at all.

49
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:40,137
I knew it was wrong
to steal somebody's fiancée.

50
00:02:40,523 --> 00:02:43,122
I mean, I grappled with it.
I was up nights.

51
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,915
And not for the good reason.

52
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,852
Well, sometimes for the good reason.

53
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:49,580
I mean, Stella and I hadn't
seen each other in five years,

54
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:53,356
so, as you can imagine, the beginning,
it was just fast and furious.

55
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:56,487
Lamps breaking, furniture moving.
You see this bald patch?

56
00:02:57,572 --> 00:02:59,072
Anyway, we moved on.

57
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:02,224
Me, Lucy, Stella,
we were gonna move to L.A.

58
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,952
I was gonna become a screenwriter.

59
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:07,660
Then we bumped into you,
and you just looked so

60
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,291
sad.

61
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:10,918
Sad? No.

62
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,587
I think what you're calling sad
was actually

63
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,196
a jovial nonchalance.

64
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,744
You looked awful, okay?

65
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,792
Like a little dachshund puppy

66
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:21,479
with a bad back that's got
to pull itself around on a cart.

67
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:22,805
Why are you here?

68
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:26,767
I know I can
come across pretty tough,

69
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:29,395
but I can't bear to have hurt someone
the way I hurt you.

70
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:33,067
I think fate put me on that corner
to make this right.

71
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:37,089
Obviously, I can't fill that giant
crater that Stella left in your heart.

72
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:40,002
- I've been dating. Like, a lot.
- And then I heard you got fired.

73
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,670
I transitioned into small business
ownership.

74
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:44,332
T's the backbone of the economy.

75
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:45,508
No, it's not.

76
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,093
Ted, my family's got a lot of money.

77
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:51,388
And I want to use that money
to make this right with you.

78
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:53,249
Tony is rich?

79
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,646
Ted, tell me he wrote you a check.

80
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:00,898
Tell me he wrote you

81
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,013
a big, fat check.

82
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:06,362
A check so big it doesn't take
its shirt off when it goes swimming.

83
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:08,242
That is a big, fat check.

84
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,826
A check so big, if you had sex with it,
you wouldn't tell your buddies.

85
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:13,786
That is a big, fat check.

86
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,645
A check so big that
when you sit next to it on an airplane,

87
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,645
you find yourself wondering whether
the check should have bought 2 seats.

88
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:23,909
- That...
- Is a big, fat check!

89
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,048
Yeah! He didn't write me a check.

90
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:28,801
- Ted, I want to offer you a job.
- A job?

91
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,806
Every year, my family gives
a lot of money to Columbia University,

92
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,055
so I got some pull.

93
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:35,641
How would you like to design...

94
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,599
<i>My heart leapt into my throat.</i>

95
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:39,854
<i>A new library?
A new student center?</i>

96
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:43,607
your very own curriculum
as a professor of architecture.

97
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:47,062
No, thanks.

98
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:48,856
What do you mean,

99
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:50,814
"No, thanks"?

100
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,633
You would be a great professor, OK?

101
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,258
You are knowledgeable,

102
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:57,788
you're a good talker,

103
00:04:58,224 --> 00:04:59,934
and when you need to,

104
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:02,793
you can grow
a very handsome neck beard.

105
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:05,428
I'm not gonna be a professor.

106
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,347
Teaching is what you do
when your career

107
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:10,281
has totally bottomed out
and you need to pay the bills.

108
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:14,353
Small business owner.
Backbone of the economy.

109
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,369
I'm not gonna take that job, all right?
I'm gonna be just fine.

110
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:19,674
- New topic.
- Okay, new topic.

111
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:23,291
I just got a $200
speeding ticket today.

112
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,317
That sucks, dude.
You couldn't talk your way out of it?

113
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:28,152
You can't.

114
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,817
I've done it.
It was... what was it?

115
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,823
It was 1998.

116
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:34,862
So where's the fire?

117
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,287
There's no fire.

118
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,444
Actually, you know, there is a fire
at this barbecue I'm headed to.

119
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,961
Nothing special.
Burgers, ribs... brats.

120
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:48,849
Son, do you have any idea
how dangerous it is to be...

121
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:53,928
- Did you say brats?
- Yeah, brats.

122
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:57,306
My mom marinates them
in Belgian beer for two days. No big.

123
00:05:57,474 --> 00:06:00,683
Funny thing was, I could've sworn
that one of those thick,

124
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:05,245
succulent, hickory-smoked brats
had some writing on it.

125
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,815
Weird. What were you saying?

126
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:09,292
What did it say? The brat?

127
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,523
It said
"Property of Minnesota State Trooper."

128
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,280
"Jorgensen."

129
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:17,513
You a brat man,

130
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,580
Officer Jorgensen?

131
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:24,124
You going to this address?

132
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,038
Follow me and lean on the horn.
We're gonna be running some reds.

133
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:30,659
Well, duh.

134
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,231
I would've done that, too,
if I'd have been going to a barbecue.

135
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:35,678
Damn, I was.

136
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:37,856
See, it's all about
sizing up your opponent.

137
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,247
I could tell that the officer
was a brat man because,

138
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:43,251
well, he was out of breath
just from walking to my car and

139
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,813
he had mustard on his holster.

140
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:51,397
Manipulating an officer of the law
with your sausage.

141
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:52,528
That is very hot.

142
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:56,198
You think I can't talk my way
out of a ticket?

143
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,536
You think I can't talk my way
out of a ticket?

144
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:04,489
I am Barney Stinson,
master of manipulation.

145
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:07,756
If I can talk a stripper
into paying me for a lap dance,

146
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,817
I think I can talk my way
out of a ticket.

147
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:12,297
Challenge accept... wait for it.

148
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:16,135
I don't get it.

149
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:20,988
"Accep-Ted."

150
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:22,850
I get it now.

151
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,715
- What now?
- You want to be an architect?

152
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,289
Great. Guy I went to private school
with wants a new house built.

153
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:35,404
- Job's yours if you want it.
- Tony, look, I don't need your help.

154
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,255
Here's what he's offering you.

155
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:43,662
That is a big, fat check.

156
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:52,811
Showtime.

157
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:57,563
- License and registration.
- Of course, Officer. Right away.

158
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:06,837
Sir, this is a gift certificate
for a custom-tailored Italian suit.

159
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:09,000
So, we done here?

160
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:11,640
375 dollars!

161
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,127
And he kept the gift certificates.

162
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:18,140
I'm gonna call Emilio and tell him
to short-sheet him on the crotch.

163
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:19,641
You are bad at this, dude.

164
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:21,165
Whatever, Robin.

165
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:24,062
Like you've ever talked
your way out of a ticket.

166
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,302
Are you kidding me?
Robin's a pretty girl.

167
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:27,993
Pretty girls don't get tickets.

168
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:30,718
I bet she's been pulled over tons
of times, never once gotten one.

169
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,782
That is outrageous!

170
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:34,426
And factual.

171
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,867
License and re...

172
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:40,438
Honey.

173
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:42,831
Don't cry.

174
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,833
It's okay. No ticket for you.

175
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:48,462
Go a little slower next time, okay?

176
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:54,371
Thank you.

177
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:01,315
Excuse me.
I think I left something in New Jersey.

178
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,859
How did your lunch go
with the rich guy?

179
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:08,523
Well, it started off great.

180
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:10,609
I want to design a house

181
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:13,278
that celebrates the landscape
without overpowering it.

182
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:16,865
You know, when Frank Lloyd Wright
designed Fallingwater in 1935...

183
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:20,046
Yes, that's all fine.
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

184
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:22,269
What I'm really worried about
is the basement.

185
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:25,499
- Specifically the laundry room.
- The laundry room?

186
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:29,011
I require a laundry room
of 15 feet by 15 feet,

187
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:32,616
stain-proof ceramic tile
from floor to ceiling.

188
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:36,212
I'm a man who likes to do
his own laundry, and sometimes,

189
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,011
it gets messy.

190
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,815
- Messy?
- Messy.

191
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:44,392
Steel chains will dangle from
the ceiling at a height of nine feet.

192
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:47,952
And that is
where my laundry bags will hang

193
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:50,877
for three days
and three nights before I

194
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,920
clean them.

195
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:58,073
Ted, it kind of sounds like
what this guy is asking you to design...

196
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:00,776
- It's a murder house.
- It is. It's totally a murder house.

197
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:04,872
You know, as a martial artist,
I'm trained to trust my instincts,

198
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:07,048
and my instincts are saying this

199
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:09,290
feels very good.

200
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,205
The steak is so rare.

201
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:15,691
Right?

202
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:18,696
One final concern:

203
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:20,428
Soundproofing.

204
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:24,170
I tend to make a lot of racket
when I launder.

205
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,368
I'll show you what I mean.

206
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,630
I'm gonna go to my laundry room,

207
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,689
and you tell me if you can hear me.

208
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:37,946
Does something feel off
about this guy?

209
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:40,554
Off the hook!

210
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,617
Bro, you are nailing this.

211
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,919
- You can't design a murder house!
- I'm not gonna design a murder house.

212
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,209
- You can't design a murder house!
- I'm not!

213
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:57,852
Bring it.

214
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:01,388
Officer, please,
my wife is about to have a baby!

215
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:03,471
- Her water just broke!
- Where's your wife?

216
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:06,227
She took the other car.

217
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,304
This is Italian leather, so...

218
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,064
I... Oh, come...

219
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:14,274
I'm sorry
about that murder house thing.

220
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:16,985
That was my bad. That's on me.

221
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:18,347
New plan.

222
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:20,766
You, my friend, are gonna build

223
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:22,614
the Statue of Liberty

224
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:24,131
a husband.

225
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:26,494
Now, I got some suction down
at City Hall.

226
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:27,662
Stop it!

227
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:30,159
I don't want your help, okay?
You don't have to do this.

228
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:31,534
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

229
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:32,709
Because

230
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,014
when you were with Stella,
I know how much I missed her.

231
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:41,130
I can only imagine you feel
the same way.

232
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:45,273
Let me put your mind at ease.

233
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:47,349
I don't want Stella back, okay?

234
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:50,318
She lied to me
and left me at the altar.

235
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,853
What kind of person does that?

236
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,008
I'm better off without her.

237
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:55,607
She's all yours, buddy.

238
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:01,108
There you go.

239
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:02,696
Load off my mind.

240
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,079
<i>And that was it. Tony left,</i>

241
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:07,791
<i>and I began to put this whole
business far behind me.</i>

242
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,138
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

243
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,418
Tony broke up with me.

244
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,111
Tony broke up with you?

245
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,592
He said it was
because of something you said.

246
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,657
You got Tony to dump Stella?

247
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:32,531
I am very sorry,
but I'm going to have to insist

248
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:33,869
that you bump this.

249
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:37,331
Let's talk out in the hall.

250
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,410
It'll be waiting.

251
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,968
So, why are you here?

252
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:50,242
Look, Ted, this is about
seven months too late,

253
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:51,726
but here goes.

254
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,516
I've been in love with Tony
since high school.

255
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,675
We dated for a long time,
but then...

256
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,551
I got pregnant,
and I guess for two 19-year-olds

257
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:04,168
it was just too much to handle,
so we broke up.

258
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,177
And for a long time I just
focused on being a mother.

259
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:10,502
I forgot about Tony.
I forgot about

260
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:14,092
the very idea of being in love.

261
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:18,338
And then you came along
and reminded me.

262
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,416
And I loved you for that.

263
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,309
I loved you so much, in fact,
that it was just

264
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:27,798
shy of enough.

265
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:32,253
But I never stopped loving Tony.

266
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,466
Take him back, honey.
He's sorry.

267
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,373
No, that's not...
that's not what's happening.

268
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:41,604
Just go back inside, Mrs. Matsen.

269
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:49,028
- It was good seeing you, Stella.
- Can you talk to Tony?

270
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,015
What?

271
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,454
He'd listen to you.

272
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:56,791
You changed his mind.
You could change it back.

273
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,454
I know it's an awful thing to ask...

274
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:00,789
Yeah, it's an awful thing to ask.

275
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:02,956
I don't know what else to do, okay?

276
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:04,081
I love him.

277
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:05,916
You love him.

278
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,631
So what, you're-you're appealing
to the romantic in me?

279
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:10,591
Is that your strategy?

280
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,718
Because that guy's gone.

281
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:14,831
You can't pull
those strings anymore.

282
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:17,689
They're not attached
to anything thanks to you.

283
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:20,087
Go ahead, honey, kiss him!

284
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:22,311
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!

285
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:27,136
Okay, you can do this.
You can do this!

286
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:30,665
Oh, you can do this.

287
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:33,989
- License and regis...
- License and registration.

288
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,491
Excuse me?

289
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:38,848
I can only assume you need a license
to have a face that beautiful.

290
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:40,603
And that body?

291
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:44,090
I'm guessing something that
explosive has to be registered

292
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:46,019
with the proper authorities.

293
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:47,836
Get out of the car.

294
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,982
Why, am I under arrest?

295
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:57,346
But you're about to be under me.

296
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,227
No. False. Did not happen.

297
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:06,096
That's a line from a porno.
I've seen that porno.

298
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:08,320
Hell, I've made that porno.

299
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,780
When will you realize
that the only difference

300
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:13,847
between my real life and a porno
is my real life has better lighting?

301
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,197
You're lying.

302
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:16,686
I am not lying!

303
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:19,159
I swear on my mother.

304
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:21,474
I swear on Goliath National Bank.

305
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,288
I swear on my suits.

306
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:24,161
I...

307
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:25,286
am

308
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:26,378
not

309
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:27,324
lying.

310
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:29,753
<i>He was lying.
Here's what really happened.</i>

311
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:31,963
Go ahead, honey, kiss him.

312
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,174
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!

313
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,347
Is there anything I can do
to make this better?

314
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,410
It's me! It's Barney. It's me!
I need your help! I'm in big trouble!

315
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:51,609
Slow down. What happened?

316
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:55,407
I'm guessing something
that explosive hasto be registered

317
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:57,318
with the proper authorities.

318
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,099
- Get out of the car.
- Why, am I under arrest?

319
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:04,531
Yes, you are. I ran your plates.
You've had 15 moving violations

320
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:07,165
in the last three days.
Get out of the car.

321
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:09,251
But no, my wife's having a baby!

322
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:12,362
- I have a sausage with your name on it!
- Out of the car now!

323
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:16,049
I need you to come
to Brazzaville, New Jersey

324
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:17,176
and bail me out.

325
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:18,927
I'm in the middle of something.

326
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:20,648
Hurry, Ted. You have no idea

327
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:23,373
of the kind of the hardened criminals
they've got me in here with.

328
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,768
Are we gonna get
our spray paint back?

329
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,014
Save me, Ted!

330
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,025
You want to do something for me?
I need a ride to New Jersey.

331
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,878
You'll pay for tolls, right?

332
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,701
I'm kidding.

333
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:42,806
<i>So Stella and I drove
all the way out to New Jersey,</i>

334
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:44,681
<i>bailed your Uncle Barney out of jail</i>

335
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,183
<i>and drove all the way home.</i>

336
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:48,191
By the way, how's
that girl you've been seeing?

337
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:51,181
That super hot French chick
with the big enormous boobs?

338
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:53,464
Oh, you mean Claudette?

339
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:55,160
She's... fine.

340
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:58,578
Man, she's the hottest girl
you have ever been with, Ted.

341
00:16:58,996 --> 00:16:59,996
Ever!

342
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,770
I'm so sorry again about everything.

343
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:13,148
- For what it's worth...
- I'll talk to Tony.

344
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:15,053
Really?

345
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,675
I want you to be happy, Stella.

346
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:19,775
I'll talk to him.

347
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
<i>And I did.</i>

348
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,864
<i>I don't remember what I said to him,
but I guess I changed his mind</i>

349
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:26,515
<i>because the next day,</i>

350
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,373
<i>they flew to California.</i>

351
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:32,444
<i>Stella set up
a new dermatology practice.</i>

352
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:36,165
<i>And against all odds, Tony found
some success as a screenwriter.</i>

353
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:39,356
<i>His movie, </i>The Wedding Bride,
<i>was a big hit.</i>

354
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,152
<i>But we'll get to that later.</i>

355
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,007
But just tell me this.

356
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:44,346
Why Tony?

357
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:47,509
I mean, is it the money,
the kung fu pajamas?

358
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:49,319
Like, what... what is it?

359
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,851
He's the one.

360
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:55,607
The one.

361
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,601
Yeah, I know it's kinda sappy,
but, yeah.

362
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,462
I'm gonna say something
out loud that I've been doing

363
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,198
a pretty good job of not
saying out loud lately.

364
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,212
What you and Tony have...

365
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:15,502
What I thought for a second
you and I had...

366
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:19,298
What I know that Marshall
and Lily have...

367
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,112
I want that.

368
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:25,026
I do.

369
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:28,953
I keep waiting for it to happen
and waiting for it to happen,

370
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:30,078
and...

371
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,429
I guess I'm just...

372
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:36,190
I'm tired of waiting.

373
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:42,013
And that is all I'm going
to say on that subject.

374
00:18:47,846 --> 00:18:49,703
I once talked my way
out of a speeding ticket?

375
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:51,132
Really?

376
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:53,457
I was heading upstate
to my parents' house

377
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:56,353
doing, like, 90 on this country road,
and I got pulled over.

378
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:58,483
So this cop gets out of his car.

379
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:00,856
He kind of swaggers on over
and he's, like,

380
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:03,425
"Young lady,
I have been waiting for you all day."

381
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,734
So I looked up at him and I said,

382
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:09,723
"I'm so sorry, Officer.
I got here as fast as I could."

383
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:11,966
For real?

384
00:19:13,994 --> 00:19:15,168
It's an old joke.

385
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:21,099
I know that you're tired of waiting,

386
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:24,766
and you may have to wait
a little while more,

387
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,449
but she's on her way, Ted.

388
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:32,784
And she's getting here
as fast as she can.

389
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:20,465
She tracked me down two days
later using a phone book.

390
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,703
And that's the last time I wrote
my name in my undergarments.

391
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:29,505
You're back!

392
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,531
When you told me
that peanut butter and jam joke,

393
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:35,632
I was completely disgusted.

394
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:38,968
But I was in the shower this morning
and it popped into my head

395
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:41,449
and it actually made me laugh.

396
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:43,035
Peanut butter.

397
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:46,820
So I can see now
how I may have overreacted.

398
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,228
Marshall's words, not mine.

399
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,314
It's good to see you again, Lily.

400
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,483
Thanks.

401
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:55,597
- So what have you been up to?
- I'm going to an amnesia ward

402
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,287
with a bunch of photos
of my children and a wedding ring.

403
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:01,783
I'm gonna find the hottest
patient/my wife, and we are going...

404
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,142
Okay, so that's good
enough for tonight.

405
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:05,870
I gotta ease back into this.
