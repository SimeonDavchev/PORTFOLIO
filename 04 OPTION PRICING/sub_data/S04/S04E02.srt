00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,829
<i>Kids, when I first
moved to New York,</i>

2
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:04,787
<i>it was dingy, disgusting,</i>

3
00:00:04,887 --> 00:00:06,313
<i>dirty, ugly,</i>

4
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:07,755
<i>flea-ridden, stinky</i>

5
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:10,081
<i>and all together, terrifying.</i>

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,094
<i>But then,</i>

7
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:12,194
<i>sadly</i>

8
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,131
<i>the whole city started to go</i>

9
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,231
<i>uphill.</i>

10
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:17,358
<i>The streets got a little cleaner,</i>

11
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:18,755
<i>the rents got a little higher,</i>

12
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:20,040
<i>and one by one,</i>

13
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,598
<i>the crappy old places we loved</i>

14
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:23,496
<i>began to disappear.</i>

15
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:25,999
<i>The Elbow Room,
an old punk rock club,</i>

16
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,800
<i>became a drugstore;</i>

17
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,647
<i>McHale's, a working-class
watering hole,</i>

18
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:32,671
<i>became a fast-food place;</i>

19
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,673
<i>And Fez, this awesome
lounge in 95th in Broadway,</i>

20
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:37,292
<i>became a bank.</i>

21
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:38,525
<i>And not just any bank.</i>

22
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,867
Goliath National Bank.

23
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,200
The world leader
in credit and banking.

24
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:45,971
God, I love Goliath National Bank!

25
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,163
Okay, first of all, you look like
the last pick in the draft.

26
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,824
And... second, why are you so excited
about some bank?

27
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:54,887
Our company just bought them out
in a ruthless takeover.

28
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:58,725
Took two months.
Cost 2,000 jobs.

29
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,503
It was brutal.

30
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:02,544
Who wants a T-shirt?

31
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:06,190
Hey, Marshall, they're hiring
in the legal department.

32
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:07,435
I could get you a job.

33
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:11,026
Barney, Marshall didn't quit
his last soul-sucking corporate job

34
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:12,347
just to go work at a bank.

35
00:01:12,693 --> 00:01:14,908
He's gonna be
an environmental lawyer.

36
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,761
<i>That was the plan, anyway.</i>

37
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,569
<i>Over the next few weeks,
Marshall went on a lot of interviews.</i>

38
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,026
You are confident,

39
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:22,907
you are energetic,

40
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,582
you are focused!

41
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:26,147
<i>A lot of interviews.</i>

42
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,271
You are flexible on salary,

43
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,488
you're willing to compromise,

44
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:32,855
you're not gonna cry this time.

45
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:34,853
<i>Too many interviews.</i>

46
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,263
You are sad,

47
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,517
you are beaten down,

48
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:40,254
you will get through this,

49
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:41,575
come home,

50
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,446
get in your big underpants

51
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:45,011
and take a nap.

52
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:48,489
<i>Which brings us to September 29,</i>

53
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:50,337
<i>the night of the burger.</i>

54
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:52,287
So... what do you guys
want to do for dinner?

55
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:53,996
We just got a new cook.

56
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:55,977
You have to try the burger...
it's amazing.

57
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:57,688
Oh, great...
we'll take five of those.

58
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:58,589
Five burgers.

59
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,786
Whoa... really?
You... want to eat here?

60
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:03,800
Yeah, I'm freaking starving.
I just finished a seven-day cleanse.

61
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:05,344
I thought you just started that
yesterday.

62
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:06,814
I finished early, okay?

63
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:09,083
- Five of those.
- Five burgers.

64
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,923
Whoa... wait. What about sushi?

65
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,988
- We had sushi last night.
- Italian.

66
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:14,073
I had Italian for lunch.

67
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,088
- I can come back.
- No. We always do this.

68
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,088
We spend an hour arguing
about where to eat,

69
00:02:18,153 --> 00:02:19,736
and then we end up
eating here anyway.

70
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,491
I haven't eaten for two days.

71
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:25,473
Can we please, for the love of God,
just order something now?

72
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:28,858
Chinese?

73
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:30,398
I don't like Chinese.

74
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,259
Indian?

75
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,232
I just said
I don't like Chinese.

76
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,537
Indian isn't Chinese.

77
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:36,716
Weird meats, funny music, side of rice.

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,105
Why are we splitting hairs?

79
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:40,129
Mexican?

80
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:42,007
I just said
I don't like Chinese.

81
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:43,442
Oh, God.

82
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:59,308
Robin, yours will be right out.

83
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:02,350
Of course, mine comes last.

84
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:06,557
Go ahead, start without me.

85
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:09,383
- Sweet!
- That's so kind of you.

86
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,153
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

87
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:17,092
This burger is so good.

88
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:20,828
It's like Christmas in my mouth...
meat Christmas.

89
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:23,476
It's like an angel from heaven

90
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,739
landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's.

91
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:29,004
Where the chef killed it and ran it
through the meat grinder.

92
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:31,702
I love this burger so much,

93
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:33,831
I want to sew my ass shut.

94
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:36,798
It's okay.

95
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:39,271
- Are you kidding me?
- Guys, guys, guys.

96
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,656
When you've had the best burger
in New York City,

97
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:44,539
every other burger tastes
like my grandpa's feet.

98
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:47,739
But you guys eat up,
enjoy, my grandpa's feet.

99
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:50,466
And you've had the best burger
in New York.

100
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:53,437
It was eight years ago,

101
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,352
my first week in New York,

102
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,015
and for a kid from Minnesota,

103
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:59,738
<i>the big city was a scary place.</i>

104
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,128
Thank God it's just you.

105
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:08,138
You are being ridiculous.

106
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:10,786
- Tell me you left the apartment today.
- Why would I have to leave?

107
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,912
I can have anything I want delivered,
and New York City cable is awesome.

108
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:17,069
Have you seen this public access show
with the old Jewish lady in a bikini?

109
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,209
It's, it's disgusting.

110
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,561
Marshall, you have to
get over this paranoia.

111
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,970
You are not gonna get mugged.

112
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:24,658
Well, what if I do, Ted, all right?
I don't have a switchblade.

113
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:26,379
I don't, I don't know how to,
how to break-dance

114
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:28,283
and win the begrudging respect
of a street gang.

115
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,483
That's it, you're taking a walk.
Come on, go.

116
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,521
No. Look, the old lady
in a bikini is back on.

117
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,341
I'm just gonna lie back
and get comfortable.

118
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:36,327
Go! Go outside, go, go.

119
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:37,436
Okay.

120
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,798
- Leave the bat.
- Fine.

121
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:47,266
<i>So I went for a walk
in the big, scary city.</i>

122
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,064
And I discovered
something amazing,

123
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:50,995
it wasn't scary at all.

124
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
All right.

125
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,308
What's the word?

126
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:57,133
Your search is over!

127
00:04:57,321 --> 00:05:00,200
<i>And then, right when I started
to get a little hungry,</i>

128
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:02,754
<i>I turned a corner,</i>

129
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:05,603
and there it was.

130
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,626
The tiniest little
burger joint you ever saw,

131
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,499
tucked between a taxidermist
and a triple-X bookstore.

132
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:15,048
Name two places
where things get stuffed.

133
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,247
So, I went inside.

134
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,355
<i>And I ordered... the burger.</i>

135
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:23,369
Thank you.

136
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,650
Ted. Ted, you got to wake up.
Ted, wake...

137
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,526
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

138
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:13,629
I'm all right.

139
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:18,532
Ted. Ted, I've just had the most
amazing burger of my life!

140
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:21,072
It's this awesome little place,
Regis Philbin eats there,

141
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:22,700
so it's sort of like
a celebrity hot spot.

142
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:25,156
But the burger, Ted. The burger.

143
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:27,573
Dude. I want one of those burgers
right now!

144
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:29,088
Do you think they're still open?

145
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:32,371
I don't know. Does stuff in New York
stay open past... 9:30?

146
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:35,075
<i>So we went out to get another burger.</i>

147
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:36,870
<i>But after hours of searching...</i>

148
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,204
Damn it! Where is this place?

149
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,528
You couldn't find it?

150
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,809
We didn't know our way around.

151
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,208
Just getting back
to the apartment took us

152
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:45,410
three hours
and one very helpful drag queen.

153
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:47,335
Wait, Betty Noir was a drag queen?

154
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,321
Well, where do you think it was?

155
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:52,020
Probably tucked between her legs.

156
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:55,213
You know what's not a drag?

157
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,600
Getting a home equity loan
at Goliath National Bank.

158
00:06:57,853 --> 00:06:58,853
I'm just saying.

159
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:01,647
Anyways... we never found the place.

160
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,966
Now, eight years have passed, still

161
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:06,318
no burger.

162
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,936
I couldn't help but overhear.

163
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:11,852
Okay, here we go.

164
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:13,387
I know the place you're talking about.

165
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:14,519
No, you don't.

166
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,763
It's a place called the Corner Bistro.

167
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,354
Great burger.

168
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,622
Oh, the Corner Bistro!

169
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:24,129
It's amazing,
I spent a quarter of my life

170
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:26,072
searching for the best burger
in New York City,

171
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,751
but silly me, it never occurred to me

172
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:31,502
to check the highest-rated burger
in the Zagat guide.

173
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,211
Wow, thanks a lot, guy.

174
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,441
Let me return the favor.

175
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,652
Great cup of coffee,

176
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:38,862
Starbucks.

177
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,286
So I take it you've tried
the Corner Bistro.

178
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:49,019
I've tried every so-called best burger

179
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:51,273
in New York City
trying to find that burger.

180
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:54,418
Or at least forget about her.

181
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:12,917
We're going.

182
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:16,475
But none of those places
even came close.

183
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,750
Hey, there was that one time we thought
we had a break in the case, remember?

184
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,812
Get this.

185
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,210
You know who works out at my gym?

186
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:23,454
Regis Philbin.

187
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:25,501
The autographed picture.

188
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,821
Of course I remember the place.

189
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,981
It was the best burger I ever had.

190
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:32,610
I still have dreams about this burger.

191
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,891
Beautiful, haunting dreams!

192
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:39,635
I wake up at night screaming,
"Get out of my head, burger! Get out!"

193
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:41,077
That's the one, Mr. Philbin.

194
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:42,273
Do you remember where it is?

195
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:44,016
No! I never wrote it down.

196
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,914
But not a day goes by
that I don't regret it.

197
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,111
Why? Why? Do you know where it is?

198
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:52,418
And if you tell me
it's at the Corner Bistro,

199
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:54,037
I'm gonna smack you right in the face!

200
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:55,398
We don't, we don't know where it is.

201
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:57,751
Listen, Blondie!
Don't mess with me!

202
00:08:58,277 --> 00:08:59,922
Daddy needs his meat.

203
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:02,260
I don't know where it is,
Regis, I swear!

204
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:04,768
What about you, Lurch?

205
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:07,237
And what about you, satchel-mouth?

206
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:10,330
This is my cell.

207
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,353
You find that burger,
you call me day or night.

208
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,156
Okay, Regis, we will, we will.

209
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:17,245
All right, so what are you waiting for?
Get out and find the burger!

210
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,109
- All right, all right.
- Let's go, all of you!

211
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:22,782
That's where my story ends.

212
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:26,819
Now I'm doomed to walk the earth
forever searching for that green door

213
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:29,749
and that red neon sign
that says "Burger."

214
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:32,649
Green door, red neon sign
that says "Burger?"

215
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:33,898
- Yeah.
- I know that place.

216
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:37,005
I've walked by it a million times.
It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.

217
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,245
I knew it was on a numbered street!

218
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,775
- Finally.
- No! Robin!

219
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,766
If any of us is gonna eat
a burger tonight,

220
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,813
it's gonna be the best burger
in New York.

221
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,743
We're going downtown!

222
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,867
I cannot believe
we're finally gonna have this burger.

223
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:00,933
Honey, I'm so excited for you.

224
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,545
After all these interviews,

225
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,258
after all these disappointments,

226
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:06,839
you deserve a triumphant
mouth full of meat.

227
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:08,905
You know what else is a mouthful?

228
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:11,374
All that double-talk other banks
give you.

229
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:14,811
At Goliath, customer satisfaction
is our most important investment.

230
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:18,951
Barney, I hate to break this to you,
but working for a bank's kind of lame.

231
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:20,073
Oh, yeah.

232
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,735
How lame is free automatic bill pay,
Lil?

233
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:25,815
How lame is 3.3% APY online savings?

234
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:27,567
Yeah! That's right.

235
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:29,016
Hate to make you look stupid

236
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,323
in front of your friends,
but you left me no choice.

237
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,645
We should probably call Regis.

238
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:37,786
Reg... Oh, that guy scares me.

239
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:39,242
I think I'll leave him a text.

240
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,824
Now, Kathy, your last flip was heads.

241
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:43,495
The one before that was tails.

242
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:44,734
You polled the audience,

243
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:46,905
they came out split, 50/50.

244
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:48,205
No help at all there.

245
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,200
So, for $258,000...

246
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:55,050
I have to ask you, Kathy,

247
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,513
what's it gonna be,

248
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,271
heads... or...

249
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,626
Excuse me.

250
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:06,001
Oh, boy. I-I've got to go.
I've got to go!

251
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:11,924
Green door, red neon sign.
Guys, this is the place.

252
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,726
No, I've actually, I've actually...
I prepared a few words.

253
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,839
I will eat your hand.

254
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:18,047
All right, well,
let's just go inside then. Shall we?

255
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:20,064
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

256
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:21,268
Yours will be right out.

257
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,053
Please, go ahead, start.

258
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,887
- Just shut up and eat.
- All right.

259
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,830
Oh, my God.

260
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:35,706
I'm never brushing my teeth again

261
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:38,363
unless it's with a toothbrush made
from this burger.

262
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:42,504
I think I just had my first burg-asm.

263
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:44,606
I want

264
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,282
to take this burger out to dinner,

265
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:49,245
then maybe a movie,

266
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:51,489
then take it back to my place,

267
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:55,181
put on a little Terence Trent D'arby,
and then I would just

268
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:57,115
fool around a little bit.

269
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,585
Nothing serious...
just take it slow, you know?

270
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,347
- This isn't it.
- What?

271
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:03,915
It's not it.

272
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,413
Okay, Marshall, you might not want
to hear this, but

273
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:09,626
is it at all possible this is the same
burger you had eight years ago,

274
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:12,327
only it could never live up
to your ridiculously high expectations?

275
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:13,768
I mean, it is just a burger.

276
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:14,843
Just a burger?

277
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:17,471
Just a burger?

278
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:22,053
Robin, it's so much more
than just a burger.

279
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:25,679
I, I mean, that first bite...

280
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:28,862
Oh, what heaven that first bite is.

281
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:32,049
The bun, like a sesame freckled,

282
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:34,639
breast of an angel,
resting gently on

283
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:36,086
the ketchup and mustard below.

284
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:39,381
Flavors mingling in a seductive
pas de deux.

285
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:41,132
And then

286
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:44,007
a pickle

287
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:47,935
the most playful little pickle,

288
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,506
and then a slice of tomato,

289
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,958
a leaf of lettuce, and a,

290
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:55,184
a patty of ground beef so

291
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,220
exquisite

292
00:12:57,807 --> 00:12:59,377
<i>swirling in your mouth,</i>

293
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,422
<i>breaking apart and combining again</i>

294
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:04,373
<i>in a fugue of sweets and savories so</i>

295
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:06,687
delightful.

296
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,289
This is no mere sandwich
of grilled meat

297
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:11,751
and toasted bread, Robin.

298
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,971
This is God

299
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:16,995
speaking to us through food.

300
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,499
And you got our wedding vows
off the Internet.

301
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,241
Okay... look, so, so this,
this isn't the place.

302
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:27,549
All right, it's no big deal.

303
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,571
It's another place
with a green door

304
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:31,710
and a red neon sign that says "Burger."

305
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:34,357
I'll just... I'll call every restaurant
in Manhattan

306
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:36,977
and ask 'em what color their door is.

307
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:39,795
No big deal, right? Let's do this.

308
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:48,045
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say this isn't just about a burger.

309
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:50,242
Marshall's not doing so well, guys.

310
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,215
He really needs to get a job.

311
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:53,764
Tell them about the underpants.

312
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:55,389
What about the underpants?

313
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:58,910
It started a couple of weeks ago.

314
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,215
Heads! It's going to be heads.

315
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,137
It's almost usually heads.

316
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,851
- Hey, baby.
- Hey...

317
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:09,855
Did you put on pants today?

318
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:11,278
Nope.

319
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,716
It was funny at first,
but then it became a daily thing.

320
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:20,106
I thought, "Okay, well, at least
he's not leaving the house like that."

321
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,870
Then, one day, he opened the door
to get the paper.

322
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:28,123
Day after that,
went downstairs to get the mail.

323
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,987
Everyone's got an underpants radius.

324
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:34,530
For most of us, it's the distance
from the bedroom to the bathroom,

325
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:37,450
but as your self esteem gets smaller,

326
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:40,314
your underpants radius gets bigger.

327
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:43,273
How big is Marshall's
underpants radius?

328
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:45,696
We're going.

329
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,190
Come on, Lily,
he'll find a job eventually.

330
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:56,321
You know, Lil, when times are tough,

331
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,933
I like to remember the uplifting words
of my favorite song.

332
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:03,664
<i>We'll be on your side
when you need a friend.</i>

333
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:08,099
<i>Through thick and thin
you can always depend.</i>

334
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:13,425
<i>On the world leaders
In credit and banking...</i>

335
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:17,145
<i>Goliath National Bank.</i>

336
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:18,602
Member FDIC.

337
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:21,842
We've got to find Marshall that burger.

338
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:23,776
Lily, I think we're all
eating that burger.

339
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:24,978
I'm not eating that burger.

340
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:28,490
No, if Marshall says this isn't
the burger, this isn't the burger.

341
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:29,315
Finally.

342
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:30,425
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

343
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:32,659
Did you guys change cooks or something?

344
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,698
Because my husband was here
five years ago,

345
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:36,633
and he's pretty sure
he had a different burger.

346
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,894
Yeah, we get this a lot.

347
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,333
This place is modeled
after this other place uptown

348
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:41,924
with the same green door
and "Burger" sign.

349
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:43,281
What? Uptown? Where?

350
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,563
106th and Manhattan Avenue.

351
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:51,648
Damn it.

352
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:55,512
106 a numbered street.
Of course.

353
00:15:57,528 --> 00:15:58,266
Barney Stinson.

354
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,509
Barney, where the hell are you?

355
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:02,734
I'm sorry, this is...

356
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,387
Regis. I'm at the place.

357
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:06,365
Oh, Regis, of course.

358
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,809
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I forgot to call you.

359
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,659
That's not the place.

360
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,795
The real place is on 106th
and Manhattan Avenue.

361
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:12,987
We're headed there right now.

362
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:14,823
What? Uptown?

363
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,316
Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20.

364
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:24,321
If you get there first, medium rare.

365
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:25,964
- Onions?
- Onions?

366
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:28,715
- Okay, no onions.
- Stop the cab!

367
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:35,878
Wait. This is it.

368
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:37,982
Your search is over.

369
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,805
- We got girls taking off their clothes.
- This is it.

370
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:54,591
One of 9,000 convenient locations.

371
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,881
It was ri... it was right here.

372
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,812
It was,
it was right on this very spot.

373
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:06,329
I don't understand.
Where is the burger place?

374
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:07,899
It's not a burger place anymore,
it's a...

375
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:09,269
Goliath National Bank ATM.

376
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,357
Well, that's fine.
Let's just eat here.

377
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,011
We can't eat here. It's an ATM.

378
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:15,936
But, food.

379
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:18,471
Hey, what the...?

380
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:21,062
This is your fault,
you and your stupid bank.

381
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,980
- You did this.
- It's not my... stop, okay.

382
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:24,905
Stop that, Lily.

383
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:28,220
I will never use a
Goliath ATM ever again.

384
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:30,661
Goliath National Bank sucks.

385
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:33,350
It's the worst bank on
the face of the earth.

386
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:37,575
Attention, New Yorkers,
this bank sucks! They suck!

387
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:40,931
- Marshall, will you just tell her already?
- They suck, suck, suck!

388
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:42,387
Tell me what?

389
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:45,412
Tell me what?

390
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,159
I got a job.

391
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:48,985
What? Where?

392
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:51,464
Goliath National Bank.

393
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:54,830
That's why Barney's been going on and
on about how, how great Goliath is.

394
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:56,332
He wanted you
to be excited for me since

395
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,112
we're going
to be working there together.

396
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:00,243
Well, technically not together.

397
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:02,375
You won't have access to my floor.

398
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,344
But you want to be
an environmental lawyer.

399
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:08,696
Yeah, you know, and I also want to be
a Harlem Globetrotter

400
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,081
and get paid in candy, but

401
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:14,982
in the meantime, I need a job, and
this is, this is a really good one.

402
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:18,111
It's great pay
and there's good benefits,

403
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:20,158
and to be honest,

404
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:22,853
it gives me a reason
to put on pants in the morning.

405
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,096
You know, I have my whole life
to save the planet, but right now,

406
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:28,499
I'm kind of really excited
to wear pants again.

407
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:30,743
You've got great pants.

408
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:33,954
- I love you.
- I love you.

409
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:36,084
Robin, no.

410
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,566
- They're unopened.
- Give it.

411
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,267
- They're barbecue.
- Give it!

412
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,880
I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.

413
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:44,410
It's stupid.

414
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:46,946
I think about that first week
in New York. You know?

415
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,716
I was 22 years old.

416
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:51,138
I had my whole future ahead of me.

417
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,718
I guess I just kind of thought that if
I could have that burger one more time

418
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,789
and feel that way for one more night,

419
00:18:58,127 --> 00:18:59,851
that I might be able
to check that off the list,

420
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,077
and grow up,

421
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,187
go work for the stupid bank,
and just

422
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:05,322
be happy.

423
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:07,632
You know, that burger place isn't gone.

424
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,527
It just moved to a new location.

425
00:19:10,354 --> 00:19:12,842
And I can tell you where that is
for a hundred bucks.

426
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,312
A hundred bucks? That's crazy.

427
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:18,218
Let's pay the man.

428
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:20,086
- I paid for the cab.
- I don't have any cash.

429
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,270
I haven't worked since March.

430
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:24,380
Wow, if only there were an easy,

431
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:27,835
convenient way
to get some cash right now.

432
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:38,296
Member FDIC.

433
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:42,673
<i>So we paid the guy,
and 20 minutes later...</i>

434
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:45,753
All right, Marshall, remember.

435
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:47,209
It might not taste as good.

436
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:50,063
This place has changed, you've changed,
New York has changed.

437
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,176
Just... don't get your hopes up
too high, okay?

438
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:05,409
- This is it.
- Yes!

439
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,371
It's exactly the same.

440
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,709
It's the best burger in New York.

441
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,775
Go ahead, eat up, eat up.

442
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:14,493
<i>And so, after finally tasting again</i>

443
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:16,959
<i>the burger he'd craved
for so many years,</i>

444
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:18,620
<i>Marshall got up the next morning,</i>

445
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:21,334
<i>put on some pants,
and went to work,</i>

446
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:23,911
<i>and he never looked back.</i>

447
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:30,455
I want to get tiny fitted sheets
for this burger,

448
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:35,318
and just crawl into this bun,
get all cozy, and die there.

449
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,712
Oh, my God.
I just want you inside of me.

450
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:42,454
This feels so good.

451
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,308
I'm worried
I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.

452
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,759
If he does get that burger pregnant,

453
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,829
I have dibs
on the delicious burger babies.

454
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:54,821
- This isn't it.
- What?

455
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,671
No, Regis Philbin. Come on.

456
00:20:56,812 --> 00:20:59,647
That's outrageous.
That is unbelievable.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait. This is it, yes!

458
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,456
You were just freakin'
teasing us, Philbin.
