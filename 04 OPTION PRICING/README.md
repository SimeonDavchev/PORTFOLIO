# Option Pricing Analysis based on Words Per Minute (WPM) in HIMYM

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the words per minute (WPM) from subtitle files of the TV show "How I Met Your Mother" (HIMYM) and use this data for option pricing. The analysis is broken down into the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Consistent naming of subtitle files and data extraction.
2. **Data Aggregation:** Combining WPM data from various subtitle files.
3. **Data Visualization and Modeling:** Visualization of WPM trends across episodes and modeling using ARIMA and polynomial regression.
4. **Option Pricing:** Estimation of option pricing based on the modeled WPM data using the Black-Scholes model and Put-Call parity principle.

## Sections Overview

### Part I: System Initialisation and Data Preparation
- Ensure that subtitle files have consistent naming.
- Setting up required libraries and functions.

### Part II: Data Aggregation
- Aggregation of WPM data from different subtitle files into a comprehensive dataset.

### Part III: Data Visualization and Modeling
- Visualization of WPM trends across episodes.
- Model selection and fitting using methods like ARIMA and polynomial regression.

### Part IV: Option Pricing
- Option pricing using the Black-Scholes model based on the modeled WPM data.
- Interpretation of episodes as trading days.

## Final Thoughts
The project provides a unique approach to option pricing by using data from a popular TV show. It serves as a demonstration of how diverse datasets can be employed in financial modeling and analysis.
